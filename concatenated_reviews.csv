"I just installed it and it was very easy, package contained everything needed and took about 20 minutes including reading instructions. Luckily I had GFCI outlet close to it and cord was just enough to reach it. It has everything I ever wanted. Easy to understand menu. Buttons for Rear (oscillating) stream and Rear+ which has more powerful stream. Rear+ stream work only when seated on bidet with kids mode off. Front wash (feminine). Pulse button which streams from low to higher pressure I love this feature. Its enjoyable feeling. Self cleaning nozzles with optional manual rinse mode. 5 water heater levels. 5 levels of water presure. 5 levels for heated air blower. Kids mode This is my first ever bidet that I bought and installed. Heated sit and its a little softer than plastic sit that I had before. 2 energy saving modes First one has green light keeps water heated always at designated temperature and shuts off if not used in 24 hours. Second power saving mode has red light and automatically turns water heater only when seated on bidet heating water for few minute before use. As I understand red power saving mode takes less electricity. I didn't try to adjust nozzle position but it was already in the comfortable spot for me. Air dryer work well too but takes few minutes to dry anyway. Overall it best bang for your buck. All the luxury features at low cost and quality is good (korea). Stainless steel retractable nozzle. I'm much happier now then when I was using toilet paper. I takes less time and effort and you get better results cleaner refreshed feeling nit scratching sensitive parts especially when have hair there. I absolutely love this bidet especially it Pulse feature and heated seat and enjoy to use it. At beginning I was looking at lower cost bidet attachments but realized they not work that well need additional water valve to adjust pressure and can't be attached to any toilet seat but need only flat on the underneath seats and may require additional bumpers added to the seat. After all it came up at about 70$ so I decided it worth to spend a little extra and get this everything included bidet with heated water and seat and water pressure levels not required additional water valve . So Im very happy about this bidet purchase and don't regret any second. Would purchase again for my second and third bathrooms and recommend to my sister and anybody else to go get it!"
"2nd time was a charm & works like a dream! This 1 was so dang easy to install it took me 15 minutes to do it myself with no tools! Granted a little more directions would’ve helped (how to use the remote would’ve helped) than were supplied but I already had a run in with a competitor’s bidet a few weeks ago so I knew what to expect from watching videos & online directions. You simply cut the water off at the source behind the toilet & follow the directions supplied. This does not have a template included so you kinda have to guess whether you have the bracket in right place but if you don’t it’s an easy fix. Just pop the bidet off the brackets, loosen the screws & adjust bracket, then pop on bidet again. You want it seated back far enough that you don’t have more than an 1” overhang of the bidet seat over the toilet. Then if you do everything right & the plumbing gods are smiling on you when you plug it in you’ll be rewarded with the sweet music of the system starting itself up. It’s day number 1 of using it here & 3 American men in the household with 1 old lady so if I quit buying the big packs of toilet paper I’m a happy woman 😊
1 star off for lack of directions! Even a website would help for knowing how to use the remote 😁

Edit 05/22/2023 - gave it back 1 star because you don’t really need the remote directions. And it lives up to all it’s claims. Dryer is strong enough for me, water stays at least lukewarm & if all else fails w/remote responding simply unplug it for 10 seconds & it resets itself. More than I expected for a bidet top under $250. Made me a bidet lover 🥰

Edit 11/26/2023 - 6 months later and still working correctly. Only thing is the feminine clean button will not work but you really don’t need it and it’s a quick fix by buying a new remote control. Still was a good buy and you got to love that heated seat on cold months. Only drawback is inline water heater will blast out hot water for about 5 seconds and then goes to a tepid temperature gradually getting colder the longer it’s on but believe me tepid is better than cold! lol the power must have surged or something one time and knocked the power off so I got a cold rinse which was not expected or welcomed!

Still a good buy in my eyes ☺️"
Works pretty well overall. Rear wash does what its supposed to. Can't speak to the female front wash although it does hose down my hangers OK. The drying fan is a total bad joke. Very small and pretty much useless unless you sit there for 30 minutes. Use of some TP or a towel is necessary.
"We've had this for about two weeks now. After our old toilet seat broke we decided to give a bidet seat a try. There are so many to choose from! Basically, I was looking for something that had a good number of features (strong enough spray, front spray, dryer, etc) and was around the $200 mark. This seat has it all and then some! All I can say is I'm not disappointed at all with my purchase. The seat was easy to install, I think lining it up just right took the longest, but I had it all installed within 30 minutes and had no leaks, that includes a shut-off value I bought separately, just in case. As for operation, it works as I expected it too. I was worried that with the shut-off value the flow would be reduced and the stream would be weak but that wasn't the case. The water flow isn't blasting me off the seat but it's strong enough to get everything clean and that's the point, right? The dryer is warm and does an ok job, sometimes I run that twice and by the end of the second cycle, things are usually good. The controls are clear and easy to reach, I thought about going with a remote control type unit but with small kids, we decided something attached that couldn't get lost or used as a toy was probably a better choice for us. If I had to find a negative I'd say the seating area was a little smaller than we were used to, but that only bothered me for a day or two. Also, I find I have to shift around a little sometimes to get the spray in just the right spot but again, not a big deal and I imagine that's something you might have to do regardless of which seat you buy. The bottom line for me is that it gets everything clean, and it didn't cost a lot to do it! So hopefully between having to pump the septic less and using hardly any toilet paper, it will pay for itself eventually.
7/16/20 FOLLOW-UP
So a year later still no complaints. I've found the shut-off valve was not a necessity for us, even with two Pre-K kids there have been no accidental sprayings! In fact, they are starting to use it now too, although I do find it isn't as effective for them as it is for my older child and the adults. One of the LED lights stopped working about 6 months ago but that isn't a big issue. I also found the seat doesn't seem to heat as much in the back, but I'm not sure if that's a failing or just where the heaters are positioned, again not a big issue for us. We will probably get one for the kids' bathroom soon, while I might not get this exact model I will certainly consider the brand.
6/6/23 Final Update
Well, it seems to have worn out. Tried to use it today and it wouldn’t spray and is leaking so got just about 4 years out of it."
We really like the alpha bidet. It is easy to use and it works very well.
"Having previously owned a $30 add-on bidet that worked very well for 3-4 months... until the plastic nozzle eroded to the point it was more like a garden hose than a targeted stream, I sought a bidet featuring a stainless steel nozzle. Unfortunately they were 4 to 10 times the cost.
But no matter, I decided to give this one a try.
First off, my SOLE INTEREST was the stainless steel nozzle... I had NO interest in any of the extra features, as the more complex they got, the more trouble I'd expect later. (And I was correct)
#1 unit lasted barely 4 days before it developed a continuous dripping out of a weep-hole adjacent to the nozzle... something Alpha tech support agreed was not normal, so I returned the unit for a replacement.
#2 unit is still functioning 'normally' after 3 weeks of use. That said, here is what 'normal' means:
PROS:
- Easy to install
- Three separate nozzles offer good 'targeting'
- All kinds of ""cool"" extra features (my S.O. likes the heated seat but does not use the bidet part at all)
CONS:
- Takes away 4"" of open bowl space (feels like using an RV camper toilet)
- Unnecessary extra features requiring electricity (Had to buy a cord to run from wall on other side of the vanity, giving up an outlet so had to get a splitter as well)
- Very slow... 4-5 seconds to respond compared to the INSTANT flow turning the knob on the $30 bidet
- A dryer? Really? Even 90 seconds of pitifully weak warmed air isn't enough
- Randomly flushes (cleaning?) the nozzle and makes weird noises after sitting on the seat but not using any of the controls.
- Inadequate pressure... more like a tickle than a spray to CLEAN thoroughly
even using Rear+ at the highest pressure setting it is FAR less than the pressure of the $30 bidet.
- Stainless Steel nozzles? (THE ONE critical feature I sought) Not a chance, just plastic nozzles INSIDE a stainless steel HOUSING. So I expect them to wear out, although not as quickly due to the low pressure.
As to the low pressure issue:
I have a feeling it is a result of using an electric pump to provide the variable pressure settings, whereas IF it allowed full water pressure to come through on the highest setting, I would LOVE it.
Wrapping it up...
If you have a very sensitive tush and seek all the bells-and-whistles like:
Rear, Rear+, Front, Dry, Pulse, Spray Pressure, Dry Temp, Nozzle Position, Seat Temp, Water Temp, Power Save, Nozzle Clean, Child Mode and LED Nightlight...
then this IS the bidet I would recommend for you."
"Initial review-day one: I have never used a bidet before but after TP shortages and some encouragement from a friend I decided to dive in and give it the old college try. Purchased as an xmas gift for myself, we were a little skeptical when we took it out of the package. The seat looked bulky and the hole seemed a lot smaller than our original elongated seat. My SO did the installation. The steps were easy to follow and we did not need any additional parts or washers like many of the reviewers stated. The seat felt a little different and slightly less comfortable initially. We actually put the seat on first to see how it looked and felt before proceeding with any plumbing. We were pleasantly surprised and appreciated the adjustments that could be made to get it to fit without much overhang. I was the first to test the other features. I live in CO and the temperature can get pretty cold. A heated seat is something I didn't know I needed until now, and I'm not sure I can go back! In fact it was one of the features I was willing to part with when selecting a bidet. This product seems to have the most features without the high price tag. The water temperature and seat temp can be adjusted. At level 4 the water was noticeably warm and the seat was cozy. The oscillation and manual adjustments allowed me to hit all the right spots. I flushed before drying because I didn't like the idea of blowing waste particals around. Even with the drying feature, I needed to use a small amount of TP to finish the drying. The self cleaning feature seemed to do the trick. Overall, I am happy and have no buyer's remorse on this purchase! I might regret sharing details about bodily functions with millions of strangers, but it's for the common good right?"
Been using this for a few months already and glad we bought it. This will be our 2nd one and the first one lasted me for 5 years and it stopped working. We needed and upgrade so decide to buy this. It is worth it.
"I have two bidet washlets, one is made by a Japanese company (Toshiba) and this one. I purchased Toshiba bidet in 2016, and this item in 2019. I mainly use Toshiba one. Today, Alpha bidet's side control panel has stopped responding to temperature. It was fine till now. On the other hand, Japanese one is working perfectly fine.

I contacted the customer service. The very sleepy sounding guy said that it might be the water tank heating issue as well as the seat issue. I explained that the buttons on the control panel stopped working more than once. I even made the beep noise that buttons make when you press them. But he kept telling me that I should either purchase water tank heater and the seat replacement, totalling about 100 dollars. Or my other option is ship it to the company so that the technicians can fix it. They will gratefully ship it back to me FOR FREE. This is only about 200 some dollars. Another good Japanese company, TOTO has a washlet bidet just under 300 dollars that I can purchase. Sending this item in and paying for parts and labour would cost me just about the same price as a brand new washlet from a reputable brand that's been making bidet for much longer than this unknown American (is it?) brand.

I have no clue what I was thinking when I purchased this, should've gone with either Japanese or Korean brand, since they do have washlets in their houses. Never again."
"Light in seat already out after three weeks, eco function does not work well. Was very easy to install did it myself, took 20 min. Will never be without one."
"We bought this bidet to add to our 2nd bathroom. I have to say this bidet was definitely the easiest of the 3 bidet I've installed at my house. Of course after installing it, I had to take it for a test run and it works beautifully. Water pressure is just right, the ability to control the water temp is awesome and the cushion is just soft enough. I find this to be a great buy and would definitely recommend"
I bought one so far so good. This product is easy to use and worth of money. Better than remote control ones.
The LED Nightlight went out 9 months ago. The sprays just went out. It was great while it worked.
"Play Video
 I absolutely love this bidet seat. It was a breeze setting up. I can’t speak to its warm seating or warm water functions, as I run warm and prefer the cold. The positioning of the sprays were perfect, I only had to adjust the feminine wash. The remote is great, but keep in mind it is HUGE. I guess it is that big so you can’t lose it? The night light function doesn’t work, which is a feature I was looking forward to, so I’ve deducted one star."
"Makes you fresh and clean. Bought for my mom too, and she says she can't understand how she lived without it. Perfect for feminine health and hygiene . Male too!
You can warm the water wash and toilet seat too!
Fresh as a daisy. Literally, the fact that you don't need nasty toilet paper pays for it!"
"I have wanted a bidet for a very long time. During the start of the Coronavirus Pandemic it was literally impossible to find toilet paper anywhere in Pasadena and in LA entirely. For several weeks as well.

I decided I would finally get a bidet. I originally wanted a Toto bidet but being temporarily laid off, I didn’t want to spend that much. My bf found this and after reading all of the reviews I decided to buy it.

I LOVE this bidet. Even during warmer weather I keep some sort of heat setting turned on for the seat. It is so much more pleasant in the mornings.

The water temperature settings are great as well as all of the functions for the water stream/ spray

There is a sled cleaning setting for the nozzle and it’s awesome! I use it once a week. To clean the nozzle. The bidet itself is easy to clean around.

The one thing that I do not like... the dryer. Unfortunately, you can keep this dryer going and turn it on several times and it still isn’t going to dry. You will still use some toilet paper or cloth but significantly less and only to pay dry. If anything, pat dry and then use the dryer. Because of the location of the dryer to fit with the seat, I don’t see how the dryer function can really be that efficient.

Otherwise- this bidet is fear for the price and I do recommend it. Just don’t get your holes like I did that j would never ever have to buy toilet paper again. Still- I want to take this with me wherever I go!"
" I’ve had a Tushy bidet attachment in our upstairs bathroom for exactly six months. I was sick and tired of our main floor bathroom being a toilet for peasants. I also didn’t want to run up a flight of stairs at 2am in the dark every time I wanted a superbly clean hiney. I asked my husband if it was cool to put a second bidet in — since he doesn’t particularly use the one upstairs because the Tushy we got is not the “spa” version. It’s ice cold. It’s like putting your bum in a York Peppermint Patty commercial because, brother, you’ll feel the sensation. Even with the Arctic chill forcibly power washing my nethers with a blast of water every time I go to the bathroom, I actually quite liked the Tushy.

And then we installed the Alpha GX Wave this morning. It took more time to clean up the bathroom than it did to install. This f-er has a giant remote, seat warmer, an oscillating water gun for your bits, it recognizes when you sit down … and it hits my hole in JUST the right spot so I don’t have to fiddle with levers and switches to get a shining Good Housekeeping Seal for my pristine b-hole.

The temperature? Golly. This is like going to the beach on the most perfect day. The heated fan? Like a gentle breeze when you’re exiting the water at that beach, rolling over your skin like a light cashmere sweater only it’s drying off your tuchis. By the gods, this is the finest bidet toilet seat in all the land. It is the alpha to my omega, and my omega is my butt."
"I bought this as an upgrade to a $35 bidet, hoping to use the ""high powered"" fan drying to eliminate toilet paper--it's completely, laughably, worthless. Using the fan will dry you at the same rate as evaporation. It would likely take over 20 minutes to become completely dry. Fan: FAILURE.

The spray nozzle takes about 10 seconds to begin since it has to electronically extend. This is an annoying downgrade, especially compared to a non-electric bidet if you are used to it spraying instantly. Pressure is slightly lower. Spray nozzle: FAILURE.

Very easy to install and nice that it has a reservoir for hot water so you don't have to do a second tube hookup to the sink for hot water; however, the hot water only lasts about 5 seconds before gong back to tap temperature. Slight upgrade.

This is a very well made, high quality bidet, and I'm sure that it would be seem amazing if you're upgrading from using nothing. But it's not anywhere near worth the $220 price tag--buy a $35 non-electric model instead. Price for the value: FAILURE."
We own 3 Alpha Bidets and have purchased 4 as gifts for family members. This one by far is the best. I love the modern remote. The bidets last and in the 6 years of owning ours we have never had a problem with any of them.
This bidet works well but the elongated seat does not fit my American Standard Champion 4 toilet.
"In general, works well. Heats the seat and water to comfortable temperatures.

Main issue is that the seat doesn't really fit on my round basin (and it is the round basin version, it would fit even worse on an elongated basin). Despite having it pushed back to the poiyit is touching the tank, the front of the seat doesn't cover the entire rim of the basin (see photos). And the seat ring is really small to start with, so losing another half inch is troublesome. However, it does seal against the basin so no fluids have escaped.

A secondary issue is the there is a lot of lag between switching between normal and high pressure spray. The device retracts the spray head, the does a self clean or something before extending the head again, while I sit there waiting. On my cheapo bidet, twisting the dial resulted in instant response and the max pressure was much higher (water was much colder though)."
"I have used bidets for over 10 years and tried different brands. So far, this one is really good, especially for this price. The installation is no different from others. This time, I bought two of these and got them both installed in less than 15 minutes. The other bidets all have always some minor issues, e.g. the spray nozzles were not straight in the middle, the water shot extreme cold water in the first second, the fans never dried at the right spot, etc. This one has got everything aligned perfectly. The low profile is an added bonus. Its seat is noticeably thinner comparing to the others but the sturdiness is not at all compromised.

Other bidets started to have electrical issues after a couple of years. For examples, the control stopped responding and the LED lights stopped working. The most concerning issue was when the heated seat stayed on after usage and I had to unplug and plug the power cable again to reset it. With heavy usage, the lifespan of a bidet appears to be about 5 years. Then the issues begin to bother you and you just want to replace it. I’ll see how long this one will last."
"Just installed. My Christmas gift. Still trying to figure it out. Water not very warm yet. Controls confusing but working on it because I want to love it. Looks good, comfortable seat. Will up grade review as I use it. UPDATE: Love it! I have intestinal issues and this bidet seat is a big help. Comfortable, convenient, pleasant, Efficient. Gets me out of the loo much faster and cleaner. We enlarged directions, printed and put into plastic sleeve until we are more familiar with controls.
Update: 6 months later, still works great. We hate to use the other bathroom so are now estimating how to move an electrical outlet into guest potty room and install another Alpha for our guests and ourselves. Luckily, hubby is handy- can hook into electric on other side of wall. ++ 6 month update: love this even more and after 6 mos of regular use, no more hemorrhoids. It cleans the pockets which sometimes causes the problem. It has worked for me although I can’t say it would work for others unless their problem is the same. It was sort of painful on them at times but not now that they are gone and much to my surprise that they are gone. Guess I’ll continue my regular use so they don’t return.
Update 4 years later— love it. Everything still works well. Water is warm and easy to adjust temperature to our liking. Adjusted temperature and strength of the water stream as desired and it is still perfect. Adding an electric outlet to the rear of the toilet was well worth it. My husband was able to do it but would gladly have hired an electrician if he couldn’t have. We have now added a bidet seat to the toilet in our RV. Hate to be without one."
"This is a very good budget bidet and comes with extra features that others in the same price point do not come with, such as heated seats and dryer.
To be honest, the dryer does not work as well, but the bidet is still packed with features.
It is a korean product, and you know koreans love their bidets.
Installation was super easy, only issue I had was the seat sliding around left to right, but I was able to tighten it!"
I assembled and installed this without any issues. We think it’s a wonderful purchase!
"For the price it does a pretty good job. It doesn't fit perfectly as it can't sit far enough back where the two align. Meaning it's made the opening smaller so you just need to think about the space between the back of the bowl where it meets the tank. If there's a small amount of space there then the seat can't be pushed back far enough to sit perfectly on the bowl rim.

Wrong rubber washer as others had mentioned. I had to find one similar to the other buyer who posted pics of the two dif washers. I installed the one that came in the box, but it leaked. So, if your's leaks, it's possibly not user error.

Overall, I was able to get it at discount so it's definitely worth the money during these quarantine days. Keep in mind it doesn't eliminate using TP completely...unless, you want to walk around with a wet butt! The dryer is def the weakest link here, unless you like a mild warm breeze caressing your backside, you just might have to wait a good 15 min before it dried. My suggestion...poop, wash, wipe to dry, and polish off with a mild warm breeze. GOOD LUCK!"
"I was hoping it would've lasted longer than it did, however the sprayer no longer functions properly nor does the nozzle cleaner. It shoots water across the bathroom. I'd look for a different brand altogether if I were you. I loved it every step of the way until it just stopped functioning. Purchased in April of 2020 when tp was hard to find. The dryer was a non factor from the beginning. A manual bicycle tire pump blew more air than this thing. Quite disappointed that it broke so soon."
We have two of these now and plan to add a third soon. Tried other brands and none are as good as these. Stop being a savage and order it already.
"Been using the Alpha gx for about a week now and im already impressed with its functions. We bought a Toto c100 about 2 years ago and it quit working a month ago (so sad). Shopping around we wanted a panel (no remote), warm water, dryer and wanted to spend less than $300. We took a chance on the gx thanks to Amazon's return policy and we're very happy with our choice.
Spray - the Alpha is stronger than the Toto for sure. Our old seat had a wider spray pattern while the gx is more focused. I use the regular rear wash while the spouse prefers the rear+. The warm water lasts about 45 seconds but never gets icy
Dryer - both about the same, I would give a slight edge to Toto but i personally don't use it very much
Looks - here is where the Alpha wins hands down. The c100 felt like it was almost twice as tall in the rear! The gx is very slim and streamlined in comparison. Also the white nightlight is a godsend -who knew this would be so useful!
Features - pretty similar between the two except the Toto has the premist and Alpha doesn't. The nightlight makes up for it. The premist feature seems like a Toto specialty feature - I don't really notice it not being there anymore.
Conclusion - both seats are well built and clean well. The gx exceeded my expectations for the price though. Really hoping the Alpha lasts longer than the 2 years before my Toto gave up"
"We purchased 2 of this. It's very easy and comfortable to use especially for elderly family members with incontinent conditions. We look at a coupled of YouTube videos. The installation is not difficult. For a successful installation, don't tight everything completely tight yet until you are certainly sure the measurement, positions, and the installation is correct."
"We have been very happy with this bidet. If you’ve never used one- it’s a game changer. When visiting friends and relatives, I find myself reaching for the controls after going to the bathroom and sigh with disappointment when I realize I have to use toilet paper- yuck… After 2 years of use, the spray nozzle started working intermittently. Another review mentioned the same issue, but the spray nozzle can be ordered from the manufacturer and replaced for about $35. There are videos online that show you how to make the swap. I guess nothing lasts forever, but save yourself some money and just replace the nozzle if/when it fails!"
"Nice bidet but big. Cannot review how the operation is bc didn't even get to plug it in! My normal seat is 19"" elongated so ordered GXR Alpha elongated w/ remote as pic shows it's too long for toilet. Should I have ordered round? I have cold water bidet but want a heated one. Disappointed to return.
UPDATE**Easy return & purchased correct size....Love it! Nice warm water with lot of choices to adjust temperature & position of nozzle!! Happy so far since February 2023!! And yes would purchase again!!"
"I didn't trust my skills and had the bidet installed by electrician; it worked well and i enjoyed it until it stopped working today. I checked the GFCI - ok, unplugged and plugged the seat back in, the lights on the remote control light up when pressed, the sensor light is on, but the seat is not responding. What should I do?
Update: I was testing it while standing nearby abd it doesn't eirk that way. Once I was seated, it worked beautifully. I love this bidet!"
"Works great. The throne is complete! I had to install an AC outlet but, other than that the unit was very easy to install."
"I've had this bidet for a little over a year. About 3 months ago it started not recognizing when someone was sitting down (small beep). This gets the water heated as well as heating the seat. If you don't hear the beep, then none of the controls will work. You literally have to get off the toilet and wait a couple of seconds before sitting down to hopefully hear the beep on the first try. If this keeps up, I'll have to replace it, as it will no longer be able to be returned.
Edit: got in touch with customer service and they gave me some fancy instructions to reset seat sensitivity."
This was to replace a more expensive unit that finally stopped working. You get what you pay for and this is an inexpensive unit. It is advertised as having a high flow 1 liter/minute jet. True enough but it lacks very much pressure. Lacking a pump it depends solely on the pressure of your water system. It does not have a 'strong spray'. I don't find it very effective. The controls are not lighted and are impossible to see in the dark. The controls are mounted on a non-movable arm located almost behind the user. It does have a very bright light in the bowl if it is your 'thing' to see what you have done (and you can find the switch in the dark). The drying fan is rather weak. The seat is smaller than average. Overall it is better than nothing - barely.
"First, I'm a big guy (+220lbs) the toilet this was installed on was a round, 17 inches from the bolt to the front, or 15 inches from the bolt to the inside rim. Installation was simple enough and I didn't have any leaking, but even with the seat as far back as it could go, the seat still extended out past the bowl, and the sitting position was too far forward, touching the inside rim...
Beyond that, that pressure even at max was much less than what I'm used to. there is no 'strong spray'
At a guess, water is being pumped from hold/heating tank, rather than being pressure driven from the tap.

The heated seat and endless warm water great. Along with the air dryer I considered putting up with the above deficiencies. I would look at this again for elongated bowls, but the audio feedback NEEDS to be quieter or able to turn it off. If I had kept this I probably would have disassembled it to disconnect the speaker."
"Well, I thought it would save on toilet paper but it uses more TP to dry off than we used to start with. Barely a breeze from the drier, not effective. I do like the back washer but the front wash does not seem to be in the right place or at the right angle. I've never used a bidet so maybe I was expecting too much. It's not bad, we both use it, it is handy and we do feel cleaner. The remote is VERY slippery, it mounts on the wall and is hard for me to use it just flat to the wall, but also so smooth that it's very hard to take out of the mount. I wish I had looked at more brands and styles, I got the recommendation from a friend."
"I was a little skeptical about these add-on bidets. I'd read that many of them were cheaply made and failed after some use. This unit is pricy, however, using some of our wedding gift money, I pulled the trigger. It was easy to install (maybe 10 minutes, tops), has lots of options, and works flawlessly. I finally used it today and was blown away by what I'd been missing. Using the toilet any other way is just barbaric. THIS IS THE WAY!! Targeted, heated spray jet, then a blast of warmed air, right where you need it!?!?!?!? I'm going to have to find some more money for my other toilets. This one is a winner."
"My initial excitement having purchased an ALPHA BIDET GX Wave Bidet Toilet Seat was quickly dampen when after installation I discovered the control panel did not work. I told myself not to worry and call the manufacturer /distributer Bidet King. My first contact was 4/10 by telephone. I was quickly told before I received any assistance I needed to submit a proof of purchase. I did and 3 days later after no response I was told they were unable to open the files. The files were MacAir and iPhone files. I asked if they could call and we could do FaceTime, nope not that either. I forwarded the Proof or purchase in another format and asked for confirmation of receipt. Nothing, I contacted the staff was told my request would be forward to technical assistant staff. Again nothing, April 13 called technical support and was firmly informed there was no email from me, apparently BidetKing has more than one email. I was refused assistance and tersely told to resubmit my request before I could be helped and they hung up. Called back and placed on hold and never talked with anyone. I did need and I am still waiting for help. Sad. All I need was someone to walk me through the troubleshooting. I still need this. Last thing for now: the Support staff was unwilling to provide support and were quick to pass responsibility to a non existent someone else. Is management aware or is this the Bidet King policy? If reasonable access to customer service is important to you; pass BidetKing by. You won't find it here."
"The product itself seems great. It has only been used twice however so we don't have much experience with it yet. This is why it has only been used twice:

After installation, water was leaking from the T-valve (the T-valve is part of the installation kit and it allows the connection of the water supply to the bidet + to the toilet itself).
As per the instructions, we confirmed that the rubber cone washer was present at the top and pointed up toward the toilet tank.
We then purchased a replacement toilet fill valve ($12) thinking that might be the problem but the leak continued.
We then purchased teflon tape ($3) which we added to the T-valve connections but it still leaked.
However, after removing the T-valve and instead attaching the toilet supply hose directly to the toilet tank there is no leak. As far as we can tell it must be that the T-valve itself is responsible for the leak.

We have just contacted Alpha Bidet customer service and will update this when we receive a response and a resolution."
"This is a nice unit overall and compares favorably to those in Japan. The remote buttons are easy to use and control. The install can be done in 10-15 minutes and it does work every time. The one negative drawback is that the highest pressure water stream feels below the average pressure on other models (I have two brands). I would not buy this again, but I also wouldn’t return it."
Love this Bidet! It is easy to use and easy to install. I highly recommend this product.
"OF the seven bidets I have purchased in the past 15 years, this one is by far the best. It has a very complete and yet understandable remote control, it has adjustable water pressure and adjustable nozzle positioning AND it has a dryer that blows hot air where it is needed (after the deed is done). Very, very good bidet. The best I have ever owned."
"If you intend on using this on a round (not elongated) toilet, it won't work for most men. The tank and equipment in the back of the bidet takes up too much space from the seating area (about 1/5) and if you're a guy, you won't be able to wizz while seated.

I'm stuck with it, but I'd return it if I could and get the elongated version and a new toilet."
Best purchase in years! Multiple functions. Warm seat. Soft close lid. Just be aware that an electric outlet behind toilet is required. Very pleased with it.
"I was studying reviews. It seems not matter which type you have or how much it costs, they stop working at some time, so it seemed to me the $300 variety is probably as good as the $1000 variety if it has all I need. This on did. I am trying one with a remote in one bathroom and one like this with an attache panel in another bathroom. I cannot read the panel while sitting down, so have to memorize where the buttons are. That makes adjustments difficult, since it won't operate without skin sensing or weight sensing, so I must look where adjustments (heat and pressure for water, seat, etc.) are foe sitting down. Basic function buttons are fewer and easy to remember So far I am very happy with it. Removing the old plumbing was the hard part, but attaching the new plumbing was relatively easy, so set up wasn't too much trouble. Although it seems to allow hand tightening, I needed a plumber's wrench in the end to stop a slow leak, but the might have some from the toilet attachment anyway."
"I have trained myself to poo before I leave for work just so that I get to use this bidet! It is a life changer! We've been pooping all wrong for years.
Here's how to properly use it without making a mess, for those who haven't. Do your business, do a precursor wipe to see how bad it is. Make sure to get the dingleberries and then use the bidet spray. Don't use it without checking or else you could get poo sprinkles all over. Ease into the higher spray pressure settings or you'll feel like you've got razor blades the first time going up in there. But boy, it'll clean you right out! The enema is great to ensure you squeeze out any residual poo. Skid marks are a thing of the past!!"
"My wife is in love again. But it's not another man. It's her new toilet/Bidet. She is nearly in Heaven so she says. Personally, I found seat heater setting on #1 is not heated very much at all, but setting #2 is too hot. For this reason, I would give it a 4. But My wife loves it. And let's face reality, Men would never purchase one of these, but ""Happy Wife, Happy Life"" applies here. Easy installation, and easy to operate controls. Only drawback is trying to see the small lettering on the controls when you are actually using the Bidet. I guess that eventually, I will memorize the position of the buttons, but until then, I keep getting a few surprises."
"I just installed this item today. I thought the instructions were fairly clear and it went well except for one issue. A cone shaped rubber washer that was included didn't work. The washer is used in the T valve that's attached to the toilet bowl. The first time I installed and tested the water I had I have a spray coming out between the T valve in the toilet bowl. When I disassembled the connection I found that this rubber washer had twisted. I tried it again and had the same results. I then went to a hardware store and purchased another rubber washer. When I used that washer I had success, no more leaks. See the attached photo. The washer looked like it should work and it apparently does on different toilets, but it didn't work on mine.
As far as the operating function it seems OK, but I haven't really tested it well."
"I have mixed feelings about this bidet. I do like the sturdy lid and low profile. I also like that it does not need to be connected to a hot water line. I have a much more expensive Toto and a very inexpensive Luxe brand bidet. This rates right in between. This bidet provides a nice cleansing warm wash. I wish the stream had a little more range for front washing. The dryer is virtually ineffective and the seat needs to be more comfortable. The controls are a little hard to reach and impossible to read if you have aging eye sight(wish we bought a model with a remote).I bought this for a mildly disabled parent. It has been very effective in allowing them to maintain good hygiene. However, if you have a hard time getting on and off a toilet, you can NOT scoot forward because it will slide off the hinges due to the way this bidet attaches to the toilet. Luckily, we caught this problem just before disaster. This bidet works well for our purpose but I would not buy it again."
This particular S. Korea brand is very similar to all other brands of bidets with similar features. The installation was easy and I did not use the T-connector that came with the unit which did not have a separate shut-off valve to bidet. There are many T-connectors specifically designed to connect water outlet to toilet tank and bidet so I strongly recommend to get a quality one to avoid future leaks. It took me less than 10 m to get the unit operational with a simple wrench. The temp and pressure settings are all adjustable with many options to suit everyone's needs. The question I asked myself is why did I wait so long to install it in our home? Many European and Asian countries already have bidets as standard units in their hotels and it's about time. Your booty will thank you for it.
the heated seat feature is really appreciated in these cold winter months ! I like the multiple setting to make it work for you! Great Bidet!!!
"Family member had abdominal surgery and needed assistance cleaning after excreting. Easily installed this bidet and worked like a charm. I myself have begun to use this instead of the other toilets now. Much cleaner feeling. Drastically reduces swamp ass. Highly recommend for anyone, especially us hairy men. Toilet paper becomes almost obsolete. The nite lite is a awesome bonus. No longer have to be blinded turning on the lights at 3am.

Only draw back is the drying cycle. It works but sometimes needs multiple drying cycles. When I’m in a hurry I still use TP to dry myself quickly."
This is great and it's definitely saving on the toilet paper. I am not sure why America hasn't picked up on these yet. The controller seems to not work it's getting stuck on the water temp and heated seat. I reached out to the seller for some help but there is a Manual button I am using while I wait.
"I don’t know why I waited so long. This is perfect. I just got it but so far it’s great. I’ll live with it for a month and then I’m certain I will be ordering another one. And then when I get to Florida I will be ordering 2 more and then 2 for the up North house. This is great! Easy to install. You will need a duplex near by. I have that at the main house. I will have to deal with that in the other houses. The cord is on the right side as you face it. My plug was on the left but the cord reached. Left or right make sure you are within 3 feet of center.

Update. When I got to FL the Alpha was unavailable. I bought a Toto for more money with less features. Buy the Alpha. Do not waste your money on the Toto."
"This was a huge step up from the mechanical bidet that I have in another bathroom, and honestly looks and performs like it should cost $500-$1000. Install onto the toilet itself was incredibly easy compared to my previous experiences with other bidets. Word of warning through, the toilets that have the high, wall mounted tank add a lot of frustration and I ended up having to buy some adapters to deal with the plumbing connections--but any normal toilet would be a breeze to install this on. The heated seat is very nice and the actual nozzle/cleaning capability is fantastic. Great product so far!"
"We wanted a bidet and I figured if I'm bothering with plumbing I should at least get some bells and whistles.

The installation went as all plumbing does - just buy a new supply line and plumber tape - hell maybe new tank guts too since you're already in there and it's drained.
I had the flat washer and it wasn't an issue. I don't care what the instructions say - all the threads need tape.

I have a basic commercial rental apartment American Standard round toilet and the round version is really too short but it works. The lid always has that gap from the tank but when you're sitting on it it's not noticable.

But a warm toilet seat is something I never thought I'd notice or care about but now I want another one for the other bathroom."
Was great but began leaking from internal components when using just 24 days after the support window closed. I guess I should have bought a Toto or name brand.
LED night light went out after a month. I haven't been able to find a way to turn it back on. It is frustrating to believe that it failed before long.
"Welp. It was good while it lasted, but has been leaking for some time, unknowingly. Warped hardwood floors in the next room over. Today walked in to large puddle in the bathroom, leak had increased substantially. Making it know why my hardwoods were buckling."
"This is a great, budget friendly, option. There are so many features for the price. I’m sure it will pay for itself because I’m already using less TP. I have no idea why I didn’t get one sooner. I’ll never go back to a regular “present” toilet again. Installation was easy. I just watched the install video on their website and followed along. I highly recommend this and may buy another for the half bathroom."
"Really appreciate the bidet style toilets on trips to Japan. Now we have one at home! Easy install, no leaks or other problems. The controls are a bit confusing at first but after a bit of experimenting we figured them out.

Two minor complaints. The dryer is pretty ineffective. Really needs to move more air. Second, it is hard to see the controls while seated. Have to use the instructions to learn to find the buttons by feel.

Revising the review after 1 year, downward from 5 to 3 stars.
It still works. However the seat and water heating functions work only intermittently. It's nice when the water is warm and shocking when it's icy cold, and you never know which you're going to get. The seat heat is a little better but occasionally it's just off for no reason (even though still set to a warm setting). If I were to buy one again I would read reviews carefully and consider another brand."
"I am very happy with this product. It is less expensive then others, but, works very well. The only minor comment I have is, that the air dryer is just OK. However, a bigger fan would not be possible considering the size of the seat. Pluses are the warm water, and the warm seat. Installation was simple and quick. I did have to add an electrical outlet though, which took me some about 2 hours. (Also saves on toilet paper.)"
"This is incredibly overpriced for such a low quality bidet. The clean nozzle feature doesn't work anymore. The ""heated"" water is warm at best and gets cold after a few seconds. And the worst part is the nozzle position has no memory... So it resets itself in the wrong spot every single time you go to use it. Awful bidet. Second star is only for the one thing that works correctly which is the heated seat"
"Had much difficulty installing the water fill adapter to the tank. It very slowly leaked. After several visits to the hardware store I discovered the adapter was the culprit. At the hardware store they assumed the fitting had a right hand thread, which only loosened it when they tried to tighten it, and made it worse.With the aid of a large allen wrench I tightened the brass fitting against the internal O ring. The catch was that the fitting has a left hand thread. Big surprise to discover the left hand thread! Fitting had not been fully screwed together. Worked fine after I fixed it."
"I have been using the round seat for a couple of months and have even received a replacement that has the same issue. The problem is that when I try to use the nozzle clean feature, it dumps an insane amount of water onto the floor on the right side (not where the plumbing is). Has anyone else experienced this, and is there a solution? I otherwise like the seat, but I need to be able to use the nozzle clean feature. I hope there is some solution I am overlooking, or some installation issue. With the 1st seat I received, I tried re-installing it all the way forward, which made the bowl area really tiny, and the nozzle clean feature still leaked everywhere! Anyone else? Please help. I'd like to be able to keep the seat but I don't think it's working right. I have a 3rd replacement from the company, a different model, but I prefer not to have to install yet another seat. I'd rather use the model I wanted, and have it work right."
It has plenty of control over how warm and forceful the spray is. With 3 different spray outlets you will definitely find the proper stream for your needs. It cleans very very very well and the heated seat is appreciated by all who use it in our house. The lights kinda nice too.
this Is a great Bidet. it requires a learning curve to utilize all its features. Particularly for a new user to Bidets
"Funny story: for our second Christmas together--16 years ago--my husband gave me a bidet (yes, I was happy and yes, I know I'm weird). I haven't been without one since. This is our third and it's probably the best one yet. It has all the features we need: soft close lid, child function, heated water. Seriously, I don't know why people are so freaked out by a bidet. For women, that cleaning on the worst period day is a godsend! I've even converted my oldest daughter and her friends. Really, this one is great. I highly recommend it."
We were unsure about which one to buy but we landed on this one because of all the good reviews. And it kept up. We really like this Bidet. It has performed perfectly as stated. The water doesn’t stay warm to long but that’s ok. We will probably buy another one for the main bathroom.
Quality product easy install but if I knew how weak the water pressure was I would just stay with my cheapo cold water bidet. Why don't they just add a water warmer to the cheap addon bidets? I don't care about heated seat and the dryer is worthless... I just wanted a little warmer water on me from the cheapo bidet... If that's all you want then don't buy one of these fancy a$$ bidets
For the price I paid this unit has the same features as units costing twice as much. Very happy with this bidet seat. My only regret is I did not buy this years ago.
"I have used bidets for 30 years. This one is very well equipped and has the same functions as bidets costing much more. The Rear + mode is great. My only complaint would be the nightlight. It is not a soft light or diffused, instead it is like a spotlight! Lol."
"I love my boots. I wear them barefoot, lol, because they feel so awesome. They tell you to order A half size up. I did, they fit great. The inserts are super fluffy for a bit. You can replace them with a less fluffy insert or enjoy the luxury. If you insist on wool/thick socks then order a full size up."
"Having it for few months now and worked fine for the most of the time. Recently I’m noticing that the spray nozzle in occasionally dripping just a bit, but after that everything fine, the control works fine, the sit is have enough softness for me, and it was pretty easy to install and I s pretty easy to remove to help with the toilet cleaning."
"Installation for all of these bidets are relatively identical and only takes about 15 minutes once you know what you're doing. The GX is a new model but the price was too good to resist. I've tried other seats from ALPHA that had wire lesss remotes but this one is installed in a guest bath so i figured a panel would suffice.

The performance is rock solid and the spray and dry are actually stronger than my other ALPHA bidet. The seat feels sturdy and its not bulky at all. I did not use any filters with this one and hope that will be ok. If it keep going strong i'll have to say this is my new favorite."
"butt never cold now.
the fan really doesn't do much, i usually have to use toilet paper at least once to dry out unless i want to have the fan on for 5 mins.

but over all use less toilet paper and its nice."
"We own two of these bidet seats, the second purchased after owning the first for a year. Love all of the features, but the seat on one recently cracked. It's the one in my teen daughter's restroom. She weighs less that 130 lbs, so it's not a weight issue, and we've only had the bidet for a couple of years now. It's still functioning, so we'll continue to use it, but fyi, not super sturdy, unfortunately."
"I don't know how I ever lived without this. Seriously. This was my first bidet and so there was a small learning curve to using it. BUT now I love it.
I've never done any plumbing before and installed it no problem. If you've been considering one, buy this one and buy it now!"
I love love this Bidet its comfortable it does everything it should with ease. I ordered it without the remote when I got it I wanted the remote. Went on their website and got the remote it was just that easy to do. 10 out of 10 👌👏
"We have the more expensive Kohler BH90s installed in a few of our bathrooms from Bidetking and really enjoy them. Side note: one of them stopped working a few months after we bought it but Kohler replaced it easily. We wanted something low cost to put into the guest hall bathroom and settled on this new Alpha model because we wanted a seat with a connected remote, nightlight, and good spray. For the price, the GX wave is just fantastic. It doesn't have the automatic lid and seat like our kohlers but the spray is actually stronger. REally slim design and the water stream never gets cold cold. Easy to install like our other seats. Would definitely recommend."
"Easy to install, has all the parts nessar1y for installation. Works great. I bought it because of the toilet paper shortage, but now that I'm using it I wish I had bought one a long time ago. It does an excellent job of cleaning your bum. The seat and water is heated. It also has a fan that dries you."
"Ya llevo varias semanas de uso, y funciona excelente.
La relación calidad precio es buena; y no tiene nada que envidiar a equipos mas caros y mas completos, pues cuenta con todo el panel básico de funciones; asiento caliente, agua a buena presión y caliente, aire de secado.
Fácil instalación. Recomendado como asiento básico y completo.
Empresa de venta muy responsable, y te responde todos los correos y mensajes que envíes o consultas a través de la pagina."
"Make your bowl a throne. Take that covid. No to crisis in my household thanks to this work of genius. Does everything I could ask for to make my morning business meetings clean and comfortable.

Heated seat. Heated stream. Heated blow drier. Customizable angle, heat, pressure. Literally dont know what more you could ask for.

Side note: double check sizes for round vs long. I bought a long one instead of a short one and it still works but doesnt fit quiet right and I regret it. Not the vendor or products fault, I should have looked at the sizes"
"have a american standard elongated toilet. This seat seams to fit however the seat cover is little to far back and as a result hits the top of the toilet reservoir cover while still slightly tilted forward. Other thing is the rear+ always starts at full power. And lastly like all other seats I've tested this far, the drier is still too weak. Roughly same as other 3 models I've tested. That said, keeping this one as it seems to do better in other areas as when compared to others I've tested in regards to on demand water heating, water pressure, ability to sit on seat cover and price is actually lot better then other models its outperforming. In general, even with very expensive near $1k models, the thing I see in reviews always is weak drier. Not sure what the challenge is ."
"As usual these reviews are requested much to early in my use of the product. What can I say? It was supper easy to install and it came with all the necessary parts. I didn't need to buy anything else. It fired straight up after turning it on.
It seems that all the features worked. Time will tell if this is a good product or not with an acceptable product life."
"Update: I bought this bidet Dec 2020. It has been 6 months since I installed it. The water pressure suddenly is weak for all options - specially wife complains very very weak for the ladies wash. To add to this, the nozzle cleaning when operated spurts water and I even got wet and the floor got wet - out of control. There seem to be a problem with the electronic control of this bidet. I hope the seller can get back to me and be able to address these issues.

It works as it was described. Warm seat, just enough water pressure, water temp initially warmer then fades to a milder temp but comfortable (although the water does not really get cold in SoCAL). The only thing I did not like was that the seat is longer than my kohler one-piece toilet due to the back does not have enough room (close to the tank). My clearance according to the Alpha was suppose to be enough when I measured the clearance from the tank to the toilet seat holes. Other than that, it works as it should be."
"Got one of these after visiting Japan and learning how amazing seat bidets are.

This is a great budget model with everything you expect: dryer, bidet, front wash, warm seat and nightlight.

My only complaints are that the dryer fan is weak & the water gets cold fast. The coldness isn’t a huge deal as it’s a continuous change, so no sudden cold shock."
"Depending on the size of the ass.
I like it.
Fit shape Swiss Madison."
"My brother installed it for me and said it was easy to install. I was having back surgery and needed it. This brand did not disappoint. The heated seat is especially nice, water is warm immediately and dryer works well! I give it a 10 for sure!"
"Love this bidet attachment. It is gentle, yet it does the job. We love the heated seat, specially in the winter time. The ""toilet light"" is great as a night light. Only thing I didn't find great was the dryer. It doesn't dry you completely or at all, so you will need to still use a towel to pat your self dry."
This bidet is as described. Was easy to install and use. Comfortable and works great. Happy with the purchase.
"my second washlet.
all works as expected. quick setup and good operation.
comparing with Bio Bidet Slim Two:
has no IR remote control (only buttons on a side)
has extra function: dryer - in my opinion is useless, because it takes too much time.

the better: water temp control (bio bidet has cold water at the end of the cycle)
the mechanical operation quieter (not sure if this is better for a long term)

good overall, recommend!"
"There wasn't room for a stand alone bidet in my present bathroom. So I researched various brands. and models of toilet seat bidets. This seems to be a good one, comfortable and strong. Does the job nicely. Especially enjoy the heated seat as I live in a cold climate. Have recommended it to others and they are happy, too."
"Liked everything about this bidet. No complaints until it stopped spaying. Did a reset, cleaned the nozzle and still no spraying. Would not recommend due to product quality. I’m going to spend additional monies to order replacement sprayer. Will see if this fixes the problem."
"Never really thought about purchasing one of these but afterwards doing so I can’t imagine not having it!
Do yourself and your family a big favor and consider one of these. You will be glad you did. I bought one and
then turned around and bought one for the spare bathroom a week later! I try real hard not to use the bathroom anywhere else anymore!"
This is a well designed product that works well. I hope it holds up. Good value!
"This product is great... 1/2 in hose didn't work and is very cheap. Needed to buy a new one immediately. Other then that, it's a must have. Great product"
"I purchased this bidet and it was OK. The curved lid made it impossible to sit on the top for any reason. The water pressure was only ever so/so and at month 15 the nozzle quit spraying. I contacted customer service who said it was out of warrantee and that I'd have to buy a new nozzle, open the unit up, replace it myself and re-assemble. The process was not straightforward. I would not buy this again, nor would I buy from Alpha as a company. I paid almost 300 and I only got 15 months from it. Avoid this."
"Have you ever thought about how heinie is actually spelled. Had to get Websters out for that one. Really didn't want to write the bu... word as it just stinks......

But your HEINIE wont if you get this!!! Yeah buddy!! If you haven't ever tried a bidet (how do you pronounce it again?) then you don't know what you're missing.

Holy volcanology, this thing is amazing. It has different tempered water you can adjust. The seat is heated. IT cleans itself for goodness sake. The ""squirter"" adjust back to front...but maybe thats TMI.

It also has a blue light in the bowl. Kind of weird looking at first but then your mind equates this light blue glow with sanitation.

This is a serious product and it is excellent, well worth the money, and I would easily make this purchase again if needed. It was simple to install and continues to work as expected today."
"I wanted a Japanese style toilet seat, but it needed to be simple to use. TLDR: This unit was affordable, looks good, and was easy to install on an elongated toilet bowl. It has worked flawlessly but cleaning and drying power are limited, which is true for all such seats. Overall, I'm well pleased.

Installation: Total install time was about 1 1/2 hours including plumbing hook up. All needed parts were included. There's a plastic locking tray that's attached to the bowl and the seat slides on and clicks into place. The large arrow embossed on the tray should point to the toilet tank, which is not shown in the instructions.

Electrical: I strongly recommend a GFI (ground fault interrupt) grounded 3 prong outlet within a few feet of the toilet for electrical power. You can easily replace a standard 3 prong outlet with a GFI outlet. If there's no outlet, you'll need to install one. I had to do that and it cost about $150 in parts and took me about 10 hours (cutting into drywall, running Romex cable, connecting to the existing 15 amp line in the bathroom, and installing a GFI outlet. An electrician can do the job much faster and better, but it will cost more. Mixing water and electricity can be a real safety hazard, so don't try to get by with an extension cord.

Remote Control: The remote control is big and the buttons are easy to read and understand. The seat worked perfectly as soon as it was plugged in. Water pressure and temperature, nozzle position, oscillation and pulsing water are all controlled by the remote. However, the duration of the wash cycle is fixed and seems fairly brief. Of course, you can simply re-run the wash cycle for 2x cleaning. You can also use the remote to adjust the temperature of the seat and the drying air.

Impression: The seat is streamlined and looks good. Slow close seat and lid prevents loud noise, but don't try to force them to close quickly. Don't sit on it with the cover down, it's not designed to carry the weight. Build quality seems good. I've used similar units when travelling in Japan and performance is comparable.

It's unrealistic to expect this seat to replace toilet paper and need to wipe (which is true for all comparable seats I have used). You'd need to install a pressure washer and rotating brushes like a car wash to actually scrub your rear clean. Similarly, you'd need a high powered blower and 1000 watt heater to actually dry off the water. You'll still use toilet paper, just less than before, and you'll feel cleaner."
"Having been to Japan a few times I've always been jealous and wanted a smart bidet. This fits all the features and doesn't break the bank.

Installation:
The installation pamphlet was sufficient but the lack of online videos from the manufacturer (Bidet King) leaves me guessing. The Alpha IX is nearly identical to the Bio Bidet Slim 2 but even so the instructions are different.

My seat came with two expanding rubber top fix nuts which you push through the mounting holes.
I have a Kohler Cimarron elongated toilet.
It was not difficult but you do need a little elbow grease to push the rubber top fix nuts through the holes.
Afterwards you screw in the mounting bolts and adjust the bracket, slide and snap the seat on to see if it fits.
If not you can push the button on the toilet seat to slide it back off and re-adjust. After re-adjusting, tighten it down and slide & snap the seat on. I have not experienced any lift after sitting on the toilet seat for a few minutes.

My GFCI electrical outlet is just above the toilet seat, but I got a 3' 15 amp extension cord to keep the cable organized.

You cannot sit on the plastic seat cover if you weigh over 140lbs which is fine since the seat it replaces handled even less. The water hookup was tight and easy to figure out. It comes with a hose with a plastic and metal end connectors. The plastic end goes to the plastic inlet on the toilet seat, and the metal is for the water source T-connector. Don't mix this up or you may end up with leak issues by mixing plastic and metal connectors.

Features:

Oh where to begin, it kind of all goes back to the remote since you'll be using this for day to day.
I mounted the holder onto the wall and slide it in.
While the remote is not difficult it's not very intuitive.
Also for the remote to work you should leave the top lid up for the seat to receive any signals.

1.) Economy mode.
green - Heated seat and water are off even when occupied.
orange - Seat and water are heated to 95F. Once you sit on it you can adjust it higher. After leaving the seat it will go back to 95F.
red - Econ mode is off and will heat up to whatever the remote is configured.

Where I live electricity is not cheap so I (try) leave it on green and only change it to orange when I'm going to sit on it.

2.) Bidet

Some have complained about water pressure but I have no issues with this. YMMV.
Pressure is adjustable and adequate for cleaning.
The spray position is adjustable to hit the right spot.
The heated water stream is ""warm enough"" considering it's tapped into a cold water supply.
The remote has a nozzle self-cleaning feature which is really amazing.
The only downside is if your child isn't big enough you'll end up with back spray on the seat.

3.) Led light.
You hold down the + button the remote for 3 seconds to turn it off. I recommend leaving it off full time as you don't really need a bright light shining even at night. It's a nice feature but not really all that useful.

4.) Fan
The instructions indicate you should ""dab"" with toilet paper first before using the fan otherwise it'll take a lot longer to get dry. Even in the expensive models you need to do this beforehand otherwise you'll never get dry.

5.) Seat warmer
At 95F it's great and I don't really need it any higher, but you can increase it.
It gets nice and toasty especially when it gets cold in winter. This feature is the most used one and everybody in the family loves it.

6.) Overall build quality.

This is a good value for the money. Easy to use and clean (no harsh chemicals or bleach).
I've only been 6 weeks into using it so I'll try follow-up next year for an update. So far so good.

UPDATE: May 23rd 2020.
This year has been a wild ride.
In case this gets flagged I’ll leave the healthcare crisis out of this. Just wanted to mention that due to the toilet paper shortages that it was a good idea to buy this beforehand. Overall usage of TP has gone down and it’s lasting a lot longer.

After nearly 6 months usage there are only really 3 issues.

1.) The remote is usable but not exactly intuitive. Once you figure out how to adjust something you have to accept that someone in your household is going to change it to their preference. Have to remind ourselves to regularly sanitize it.

2.) The spray is not always consistently on target. I think it varies on the outside temperature and how it affects water pressure in the pipes. You can double press the Rear button for consistency but you have to be okay with the oscillation feature.

3.) kids will have a harder time using the features as the “seat occupants detector” is only at the 4 o’clock position (when facing the seat otherwise 10 when seated).

12/20/20 UPDATE:
It still works great! Discovered that if you leave it on eco and the seat warmer on orange it’ll warm up to a nice comfortable temp quicker when you’re seated. This configuration has made it a lot better for chilly winter bathroom usage.

After a year of usage it’s helped us save a lot on toilet paper (especially this crazy year).

The only complaint I’ve heard is the toilet seat cover. Due to its curved design you want the seat mounted a little further forward so the cover can fully rest against the toilet tank. I originally mounted the seat with the cover at 90 degrees. To fix this mount it at 91 degrees so the cover rests against the tank."
"This product is wonderful. I bought two of these along with two new toilets. I love the heated seats! Everything works great. I will say that the drying function isn’t terribly effective, but it’s a minor inconvenience. I didn’t have to run a separate power line, just had new outlets put in off the same bathroom circuit. However, when first sitting on the seat the current draw makes the light fixture oscillate for a few seconds as the water is heated. Small price to pay."
This is my first bidet I’ve owned and I absolutely love it. Fortunately I’m an electrician so putting a plug next to my toilet was easy. The water connections were also easy. Set up was no problem for anyone who can turn a screwdriver. The seat warmer is amazing on cold days. The one complaint I have is the dryer isn’t super powerful but it does get the job done. Overall 5 stars easy I recommend to any and everyone
"Easy to install, remote works great, love night light. Has all the functionality I need."
"Warm water is not endless, takes a few runs to clean you decently, also dryer is useless, no matter how many times you use the dryer it will never dry you, so I bit more of facade product with falsely advertised features."
"This bidet is a very good purchase. It fits perfectly. Because the position of my intake valve and the size of my old toilet, I did have to buy a new toilet (much to the wife’s delight) but it was not the fault of the bidet. Measure your space and make sure there is ample room to add the connector valve before ordering. Her bathroom is now totally remodeled and she loves the warm seat and warm water."
"We got this to replace our inexpensive cold-water-only bidet. I could not see spending $1300 for a bidet SEAT, so this looked good when I found it. The remote has most of the functions that we experienced on the fancy toilets in Japan, only lacking the flush option, which would require a whole purpose-built toilet.

This unit warms the water to 3 different heat levels, can vary the pressure of the spray, can oscillate the position of the spray to wash more of the intended area without having to wiggle your butt around a lot, and the seat itself is heated, with 3 or 4 levels of heat. There is also a blower with 3 levels of heat to dry your backside, though it's probably advisable to blot with a small amount of TP first to verify you're clean and get rid of the bulk of the wetness before blow-drying the rest.

Installation is quick and easy, putting a T connector in the water supply line to the toilet, but this unit does require a power outlet within about 3 feet of the toilet. It should not be run from an extension cord.

One shortcoming: the main unit is fairly bulky and will take up a fair bit of space in front of the tank, encroaching a couple of inches into the toilet seat opening, leaving you with a fairly small seat to sit on. Our toilet seat was a decent size; this feels much smaller, as though you're almost sitting on the edge of the toilet. Not ideal for people with a larger backside.

The temperature control for the water isn't always very consistent; with the setting on low, sometimes the water gets almost uncomfortably warm, and sometimes it feels like it's barely warming it. The dryer fan is off-center, blowing somewhat unevenly across your posterior from the left back side. Heating for the fan is a little more consistent.

Most of the remote control functions do not work unless you are sitting on the seat, which has a detector in it. This prevents spraying water all over the place if someone is not seated there. There is a ""child"" wash setting that will spray quite a bit farther forward than you'd expect; you'll want to avoid that unless you're a child sitting on the front portion of the seat.

There is a bright blue LED night light in the seat that illuminates the water in the toilet in case you want to urinate while standing without turning on the lights in the bathroom, or to verify that everything has flushed. There is a combination of keys you can press to turn this off. There is also a combination you can press to reduce the beeping when pressing keys on the remote. These functions are only detailed in the manual, so don't lose it if you want to change those settings.

There is a power-saving mode that will reduce the power used when the seat is not in use, so it is not constantly keeping water warm.

Again, the remote on this will not flush the toilet for you; you must flush it normally. All the other stuff is on the remote."
"I have used the standard toilet seat for 38 years. Some plastic, some wood, some porcelain… then I discover this. I laughed when my friend shouted “the remote is on the wall” as I dashed to his bathroom after a night of drinking and tacos. I enter his lavatory to see what I viewed at the time as a confounded contraption sitting atop his toilet. However, there was no turning back. As I sat down, the flow immediately started. Just as you would expect beer and tacos to effect a man. As I recover from the first wave, I remember his remote comment. I find it. Now let me regress to say that it was January. It was cold. The seat was cold. What do I see on the remote? A “seat temp” button. I press it and immediately feel warmth spreading evenly across my gluteus maximus.

I then realize that Yucateca hot sauce on the already spicy tacos was creating its own heat right around my poor little dirt star. I see “water temp” and “rear” buttons. I press them. My singed and sweltering poop chute was immediately cooled by a stream of perfectly temperate water. I’m impressed to say the least.
As I’m feeling more relieved, I realize that in my haste to avoid a quite unfortunate and embarrassing incident that would’ve surely ruined not only my night, but also my pants, I forgot to turn on the light. However, I see a blue glow coming from inside the toilet. I think “my god, it’s radioactive… this is how it ends”. I soon realize that this previously judged toilet seat emote a cool blue glow from within.

I’m feeling quite relieved and ready for round 2. I reach for the toilet paper. Damn. None.

I then see “dry” on the remote. I press it. My soaked bum is not being caressed by warm air and is steadily drying off.

Now, I wasn’t fully sold, so I did a strange pants-down waddle to the sink and got a tissue just to make sure. I sit back down and find that this toilet seat has cleaned me thoroughly. I was cleaner than a politicians forged documents.

I arise to realize that I am poor. Destitute. Poverty stricken. To have lived so long without this miracle of a product is shameful. I vowed that I would purchase one.

Today, I did. I installed it (super easy. A slow monkey could do it), and immediately headed to the Thai restaurant for some paad thai with extra chili oil to really give this bad boy a run for its money. I let nature take its course and in just a few hours, the rumbling starts. I hurry to my throne and press the seat heater before I take my seat.

I absolutely abused my toilet. This thing was like a hot spring at a sewage plant, but was no match for this toilet seat.

I no longer poop like a poor. I am clean. I am satisfied. This is the best $250 I’ve ever spent.

Buy this and thank me later."
"So let me qualify myself so you understand my dignified perspective. I have used a bidet a handful of times in places outside the US. I have never owned a bidet and never thought I would use one... the ones I have used were not temperature controlled or even adjustable... they were a true built in bidet. But hey... maybe this southern man has been missing out! We added on to the house so I said put me a plug by the toilet so I can treat my bottom to a party from time to time! They looked at me strangely after that. So this was the one I selected... I mean, it had all the bells and whistles.

It installs fairly easily. The threads on the T fitting and the wall hose required a couple of wrenches to get tight... one extra step. Otherwise, very straight forward install. As I unboxed the bidet, I notice my targeting was going to be put the test. I bought an elongated toilet for a reason MORE ROOM FRONT TO BACK! So when I saw this hole I thought I might as well thread the needle backwards! It’s small. One pet peeve I have is my pecker touching the seat... one major reason I avoid round toilet seats. Besides that, my wife can’t blame me for drops even when I sit. I mean I even bought a urinal so there is no standing at the toilet. So... the hole is small... I guess I will just have to make sure all systems are “go” before release.

Alright at this point I nervously put the instruction sheet away (I shouldn't have done this as it would answer questions below) and contemplate all of the days of my life I have landed on the grand throne and not had a bidet... gone and never to be visited again! It was time for the test drive! As I turn around and flip it in reverse... beep beep beep beep, the only thing missing is the dramatic eclipse music of an apocalyptic scene from an outer space movie.

Landing gear down. Wait wait wait... I just bought a heated toilet seat so I don't have to wince on touch down! Turn that bad boy on! Wow... safely on the runway... it feels small, a little cramped and it takes a minute or so for the first warm up. Let’s just say I should have considered a lower lip height. I am fairly tall and I was concerned my feet would not hit the ground after finding a comfortable position. I also won’t be making any use of this right after a cold shower... I mean the new opening between the top of the seat is a vast wilderness and a shorter aim will definitely not allow for the appropriate trajectory to be achieved allowing the gentile stream to arc into the opening. Maybe an extra measure of gravity should have been included for proper use.

Unfortunately the nature of a test run... I was unable to actually report on the action.

So I begin to wonder how this ride would go. Hummm... no gear shift, no dash board and definitely no reigns. Oh yes! A remote! Life just got better! Fortunately the lovely pictures are pretty intuitive as to what you are about to shoot yourself with. Thinking ahead I turn the water temp up and brace for impact... Yo! That water temp might need a little more response time! I did the same thing with the seat... landing was a little early for that too. So, just a heads up. The bidet is a slower pace of life... enjoy the moment, don’t rush it! Otherwise you will pay with every cold drop fired from down low. Once it was at operating temp, it stays comfortable all the time... yes, all the time. So for you energy savers that thought you were going to save the planet with all the rolls of toilet paper you were saving, the bunny rabbits are still frowning.

At first I notice the aim was a bit out of adjustment. Not only was it cold but the danglings might have well had the cattle prod fired at them. After locating the adjustment and cranking that a bit more to the back, ahhhhhh sharp shootin Tex! And the warmth... well better late than never! Maybe a bit slow on the draw.

The remote, like watching any terrible movie, has a stop button. Now, all of the great things I read about this was the airflow! Yes sir! Let's dry with a strong Sahara desert wind! Wait, what is this? I had to look down to see if by fan, they meant those paper hand fans you use on hot Sunday morning during worship. It was more of a gentile spring breeze missing chirping birds and bunny rabbits. It too warmed up to a sunny afternoon breeze... but again, take time to think about all of the great things in the day cuz it’s gonna take a few more minutes to achieve a dryness you can pull the undies up to. **added after first review: This caused a deeper dig into the instructions and they say, ""Dryer effect will be improved if you wipe excess moisture lightly before opearating (actual spelling) the drying function."" So... what is not included in your Alpha iX Bidet box? A pre-dryer!

Let’s recap. Don’t get in a hurry. Watch your aim. Sit tight while the summer breeze does it’s work.

Definitely an upgrade from the outhouse but a few things could be improved!"
"After living elsewhere with a bidet, life seemed uncivilized when going back to smearing my excrement around on my skin with pieces of paper. I went looking for an inexpensive and low energy bidet that you can install just about anywhere that you can get power to. This is a good one.

This bidet has a key feature I've been looking for -- it has the basic controls (wash rear, wash front, stop) directly on the body of the bidet behind the seat. (It also comes with a wireless remote-control for fancier settings, but once I got them set, I toss the remote in a corner and don't bother with it.) My earlier bidets had a whole arm attached to the left or right side, containing the controls, but that takes up space and doesn't work in a tight bathroom.

The three switches beside the seat are poorly labeled and poorly laid out, but they are there, which is the key. By dropping your hand down beside the seat you can feel the controls, but you can't see the labels because the labels face rightward rather than upward. I used a labelmaker to add a simple label on top. They are poorly laid out because you'd expect that to wash your rear, you'd hit the button closest to the rear; to wash your front, you'd use the button closest to the front, and the button in the middle would stop things. But it isn't laid out that way; the stop button is in front, the wash-rear button is in the middle, and the wash-front button is in the rear. Somebody wasn't thinking too hard. Indeed, the instruction sheets pretty much ignore these buttons on the body of the bidet, as if they were an afterthought, spending all their time on the fifteen switches on the remote control.

I measured the power consumption of this bidet and when it's in energy-saver mode, it's super low power, less than a watt on standby, even with the LED nightlight on full time. When you press a button to squirt, it can draw up to about 6 amps (900 watts) in instantly heating the water, but that only happens for a few seconds as you use it, and then you're done and it's back to <1 watt. Many heated bidets keep a large reservoir of water permanently hot, burning power all day and night -- this one doesn't.

It makes a few odd noises when it's running, but I can handle that."
"I bought the round version of this bidet seat to install in our second bathroom as a test before spending much more to install the elongated version in my main bathroom. That will require hiring an electrician to route an electrical outlet near the toilet, which will likely cost more than the seat itself. Facing the toilet, the power cord is on the right, which just makes it to my outlet next to the vanity. I had never used a bidet before but thought it would clean better and save money on TP and water in the long run. Of course, my electric bill will increase this winter from using the heated seat and the water heater has to contend with colder incoming water temperatures. For Summer I will turn off the heated seat function.

The install was fairly easy except for the rubber plugs that are inserted into the 2 holes that hold the normal toilet seat. Also, my round toilet seems to be on the smallish side as there isn't quite enough depth available to completely hide the front of the bowl. If I push the seat all the way back the lid would not open fully. It feels secure, but it is a bit more confining that if I had started with a fuller sized round toilet. The existing 20-year-old Mansfield toilet works fine, but I may start shopping for a new one that offers more depth without causing a clearance issue in the walk-through bathroom.

It feels funny using a bidet, but I can really see the benefits. I feel cleaner, and I think a single mega-roll of TP will last me about a month. Only trouble is I might not want to go anywhere else, and I'll need to check the hotel amenities for any mention of having bidets.

3/16/23 Update: A recent power outage for a brief second exposed one flaw in the bidet, which likely occurs with any brand. The power loss wasn't even a second long, and it cleared the settings I had on the toilet seat. I didn't know I'd get such a cruel wakeup call in the morning by getting shot up the kester with cold water instead of warm. The power outage reset the bidet to its original setting which was no hot water and no heated seat. What a world we live in that we have to worry about ""rebooting"" our toilets!

04/07/23 Update: After 5 weeks of usage I can report on TP usage. My first full megaroll of Cottonelle Ultra last 3 weeks. During the same time my wife used 10 rolls. Despite the obvious savings she refuses to use the bidet seat even though she used the smaller round toilet previously. Paper use is up using a cheaper brand of ""premium"" TP, so stick to the thicker brand and buy it on sale. It needs to be absorbent to dry yourself immediately after the wash cycle completes. I suppose you could reverse the order and use air dry first and then wipe."
"There is nothing about this Bidet that we don't like. The heated seat is perfect especially in the winter. Easy adjustable temperature feature. And the wall mount for the remote control is convenient. Just buy it, you won't be disappointed."
"The Good, Water pressure is fantastic high cleans very well needing only (1) cleaning cycle my prior bidet required (3) 60 second cleaning cycles to do the job not sure why I saw some reviews saying the pressure was not good. I am only providing a water line pressure of 40lbs from a well and it cleans perfectly actually need to adjust the pressure down on the remote. The manufacture states the supply should be 50 to 60 lbs of water line pressure on high that would probably sting. The economy feature works well as it does not effect the hot water. The heated water is better than other bidets I have owned you will only have a slight dip in temp after the tank has ran out. Note I am critical when it comes to heated to water and pressure these are musts haves for me. All other functions are quite good except for 2 features I will give my opinion on based on prior bidet ownership. Now here is why this bidet is not 5 stars. The Bad, The first is minor the night light is worthless and does not provide a usable light unless the lid is open. You should never leave the lid open especially if you are using the heated seat option. If you are looking for a lighted function do not buy this bidet there are better ones on the market or you can just plug in a small led night light that will cost you a dollar. This can be fixed by replacing the blue LED with a white 6000k one. The Ugly, The biggest flaw with this product is the heated air dryer. If this is your first bidet so you understand no bidet dries you like a hand drier you would find in a rest room. The best driers require you to make a wipe and then sit for a minute or two. The drier temp is there but the blown air is directed down away from your bum rather than directly at the spot you need to dry. It basically blows a couple of inches below your skin rather than directly at it. If you are looking for a good fan dry this one is not for you there are better ones made. I think there is a way for them to easily improve the direction of the air flow and have contacted support to see if they are interested in the idea."
"We have had ours for almost 3 years, the lid hinge is broken, we don’t abuse it. All we do is lift it and close it. We don’t put things on it or stand on it. Maybe this is a weak spot."
"I love the sprayer functions, the easy to use controls, and the heated seat and air dryer. However, the seat plastic is way too thin and cracked early on, right at the back if the seat where it is thinnest. I repaired it with a high-quality ABS adhesive, but new cracks appear every month. The soft close function on the lid has now failed twice, due largely to the poor quality ABS plastic itself. The design if the cartridge socket is also a contributing factor. It uses a web design, however the webs are too thin and don’t have enough strength or resilience to handle the repetitive force exerted over and over again by the closer cartridge. Over a short period if time, the plastic work-hardens and becomes brittle, then crumbles like a cookie.
The original lid, and the replacement lid sent by the manufacturer, both failed at the 1 year mark. I‘ve spoken to others who had the same thing happen at or before 1 year of use.
The crack at the rear if the seat extended halfway across the top rear section where the seat us thinnest (way too thin). The crack on the underside of the seat, near the bumper extended the entire width of the underside. Had I not noticed it, I suspect that the next time I sat on it, I’d have ended up with my bum in the toilet and my feet in the air. Not a pleasant thought. Of course, all if this occurred just barely outside the warranty period. However, this seems to be a common occurrence so i feel they need to address this problem.
My wife and I are the only users and we are both of average, healthy weight and treat the seat very carefully. I have a background in composites and plastics so I have a clear understanding what cleaning products can and can’t be used with ABS plastics. Therefore, neither excessive weight, nor chemical reactions can be blamed for the product failure. Neither can it be blamed on abuse from children since our children are neither abusive nor present in the home. Ours are All grown and fledged, and were never even very rambunctious when they lived here as children.
I’m so disappointed because love everything else about this bidet seat. The sprayer works great and i like the fact that the remote can be mounted up on the wall rather than mounted on the side of the of the seat. The heated water and heated seat are wonderful features, too. But the plastic quality issues have ruined the experience so much so that when I replace this seat (soon), I’ll probably go with a different brand. Bummer."
"I gave this as a present to my mother and she absolutely loves all of the features. She loves the warm seat and the warm water, which is really good for us because just using the warm water valve wouldn’t have given us immediate warm water, it is so nice that the seat will warm the water right away. The drying feature only works if you sit there for a long time, but all the other features work as advertised. I bought this a year ago, and it’s still going strong!"
"Purchased two of these to replace our old bidet that had broken down after 10 years of use. At first we were attracted to the great set of features and the low price point, but after a few months both units developed issues. One unit developed a crack in the toilet seat (though it remained functional for the time being), and the other had stopped working altogether (when button is pressed, no water would come out but instead would just make loud thumping noises).

We sent the completely broken one back for warranty repair, and while the unit was technically restored to a functional state after (to be fair) a relatively painless process, cosmetically it looked like hell. We took good care of the unit and tried to keep it fairly clean for the few months we've owned it, and in the span of two weeks at the factory it came back covered in scratched marks, scuffs, dust, and some kind of sticky gunk. It was clear that no care was taken at the repair facility, and the unit was processed with the goal of bringing it to a functional state with minimal effort. At this point, we will likely not return the other unit since the damage it would incurred at the facility would likely be worse than the crack it had developed.

On the company's warranty site, it's stated that there would be a cleaning fee if a unit was sent to them in an unsanitary state. While that sounds reasonable, I do find it highly hypocritical for them to return the unit to us in a much worser state than when it left our house, even if only cosmetically. I would not do business again with this company in the future, and I could not in good conscience recommend this product to any of our family and friends."
It's great but an elongated toilet and seat would be preferable. Had to adapt to keep my piece from hitting the front of the toilet.
This Bidet was easy to install the remote control and temperature control work great it could have a bit more water pressure but the problem I am having with this model is the finished surface on the seat and control cover is pealing off after only about 4 months of use. I contacted the customer service and after I sent them proof of purchase s as nd a photo of the damage they first instructed me on the proper way to clean the seat ( This is not a cleaning issue ) they did make an offer to send a replacement seat and cover but of course at the present time they do not have any in stock but they said they would send the parts as soon as they become available. I guess now it will be a waiting game. The only problem I had with the customer service was I had to contact them again after I sent them the photo they requested it was like they were trying to avoid me because that is when they instructed me on how to clean it and it’s not a improper cleaning problem it’s a contamination problem before the final surface was applied at the manufacturer. I am disappointed in the customer service they should have offered to send a complete replacement and sent the defective one back to the manufacturer to be repaired. I am confident that I can replace the damaged parts but I shouldn’t have to but it’s better than nothing.
"One thing the manufacturer does not mention that is crucially important is that on the bottom of the seat at the front there is a lip extending down to the bowel to keep from peeing under the seat and over the top of the toilet. I have used several bidet seats and this is the 1st one that I have used that has this feature. Because the seat is lifted so much, not having this feature is a real problem. My toilet bowel is round and the unit takes up some of the space at the back of the seat so it effectively requires one to sit further forward than on a regular toilet set. If you are planning a new toilet and have the space get an oval bowel for room for the bidet seat. I have only purchase one whole bidet toilet. The one I got has a considerably smaller drain hole and is very low flow causing constant clogs. For this reason I seriously doubt I will do that again. I think this bidet seat is a good value and highly recommend it."
"*I couldn't think of a good joke title for this product so do me a favor, think of one, laugh, and then pretend it came from me. Thanks*

I'd been searching all over the place for a bidet for quite a good while. I wanted most if not all the benefits of one of the top of the line bidets without the price that would certainly break my bank. Luckily I found this beauty on sale. The seat warmer alone was a game changer in the bathroom department. It has saved me from having to purchase as much toilet paper, in fact since I've gotten this bidet I'm still using the same paper from when I installed the device. Installation was a breeze except for the fact I didn't have an outlet close enough to plug it in but ordered an extension cord and it worked beautifully once it was powered up. The pressure and temperature adjustments are so varied that I'm sure anyone can find a level they like that's comfortable for them while it also has a child mode for those more sensitive skins. In fact this is now a staple in my home.

My only issue is the light isn't that bright. Sure you can see it, kind of, from a distance but it barely lights up the toilet. So if the light is a big part of wanting this bidet then I suggest looking elsewhere but if you want a solid bidet with all the bells and whistles that will leave you feeling cleaner then I highly recommend this product. Your backside will thank you tremendously."
"I’ve purchased a few of these because they are easy to install and relatively inexpensive. I like all the features. I have had issues with functions not working anymore, like the seat heater going out etc. they don’t always fit the bowl perfectly, it just depends on your toilet. Mine are on the smaller side. But it fits well enough for me to keep it. I do like it, just hope it lasts without something going out on it."
"Bought this unit for the endless warm water feature. Installation was quick and easy. Initial trial run seems good, so I’m hopeful.

I previously tried the Toto washer c5, and I was disappointed with the lack of continuous warm water. This Alpha model is already way better in the first 10 minutes out of the box. Continuous warm water ; not hot, but definitely shockingly cold tap water. Controls are simple and the cost is much much less than the Toto. It’s a win! The only thing left to see is how long it lasts before breaking. Fingers crossed."
"VeryyreVWhoo wee! Make sure you flush before you turn on the dryer! Great product! I have the cleanest starfish in Douglas County!
Very simple installation process also."
"Great value for upgrading to a bidet & looks great on my cheap Home Depot toilet, Dr recommended one for anal fissures & hemorrhoids and i just got it installed so will see how it does. Knocked off one star for having to go buy an adapter to fit the hose"
"I am impressed with the features this product has to offer, ranging from the built-in air dryer, the heated seat, and self-cleaning mechanism. While I enjoy the remote control, I'm starting to wish this could have the ability to customize what controls I use most, and can be accessed on the side of the bidet.
The first thing I noticed when trying this for the first time was the gentle water pressure. I had upgraded from the Luxe Bidet Neo 320, and while it was very limited on the features, it provided extraordinary range of water pressure. This bidet provides 2 settings, which is disappointing in this price range. I would like to see a higher water pressure threshold similar to the Luxe I previously had.
The gentle self-closing lid and seat are a very nice add-on, one that I've come to appreciate and wish I had in my other bathrooms. The built-in lighting can be most helpful for those late night or early morning visits.
I find the self-cleaning nozzle to be stubborn, but it may have its reasons.After the nozzle has finished cleaning itself (in all of about 10 seconds), the stainless steel wand will remain outside of its housing to dry. You will have to initiate the cleaning a second time to send the wand back into its housing after another round of cleaning.
The product advertises unlimited heated water, but if you leave the spray on for an extended time (maybe 30 seconds or so), the spray wand will cease cleaning and will retreat back to its housing even when it was not commanded. I don't consider this a feature, I consider this an inconvenience. The Luxe stopped cleaning when I turned the device off.
I'd like to see this change in Alpha's next version.
Overall I am pleased with it, and award 4 stars to Alpha for its attempt at providing a decent bidet for this price range."
"I've had this bidet for 2 years now and its reached its end.
1. Even though i had a dedicated electrical outlet installed, it still blew the GFCI randomly.
2. I disconnected the toilet when I put my house in storage and traveled for a few months. Once I moved into my next home, it took days for the bidet to work. The remote only worked if pointed directly to the red place on the seat.
3. Again I had a dedicated outlet installed and at some point it blew the GFCI for the whole bathroom. Now it cannot be plugged in there.
4. I called customer service twice and they suggested unplugging to reset but it didn't work. Of course my warranty expired at 2 years which was just before my call.
When it did work in the 2nd home I never knew if I would get hot or cold water, which, is no fun.
My brother has 3 of these in his home and the water temp is glitchy.
I love having a bidet when it works hence the 3 stars."
"I bought this and the  SmartBidet SB-1000 Electric Bidet  at approximately the same time. Overall, I prefer the SmartBidet. The only thing the Alpha iX has in its favor is a nightlight in the bowl and a more forceful rear+ stream that--ouch!--I used once and will never use again. Some people may like that though. The ""endless hot water"" isn't really endless and, in fact, runs out faster than the water tank-style used with the SmartBidet. On top of that, the Alpha iX squirts a blast of cold water at your nether regions prior to giving you the limited hot water. I hate that. The SmartBidet is warm from beginning to end. I prefer it. I really wanted the Alpha to have the""endless"" hot water it promised, but no. It's not a bad bidet toilet seat though.

This seat works exactly as advertised and we've had no problem. I left the seat heated through the winter and it was lovely. I only wish the sprayer would aim more toward the front on the ""front"" setting. That's my only complaint, with this and the SmartBidet. The sprayer does clean itself and the child cycle is nice, or would be if we still had young kids. I don't actually use the dryer function on either of our bidets, just pat dry with a washcloth. The whole toilet stays generally cleaner now. While this isn't my favorite of the two seats, my husband does prefer the night light feature.

I have been looking at bidet seats for a few years because of the improved hygiene aspects, but could never make up my mind. The leach lines on our septic system have been barely functional for years, thanks to our 2 youngest kids not understanding, believing, or caring about the consequences of excess toilet paper in a septic system. We have been paying $500 every fall to have our tanks pumped for the last, ugh, probably 5 years now. When the system began to slow again this year I decided it was time to remove paper products from our system and let the leach field clear up. And that's why I finally bought the bidet toilet seats. And it worked! We haven't had a clog, back-up, or obviously burdened tank since we got these. We used to occasionally get some funky septic odor in the backyard and, maybe it's coincidence, but I haven't noticed it since we switched to the bidets and stopped using paper."
"We've had this bidet for about 2ish months now and I just got around to leaving a review now and I've had 0 problems with this thing since i've set it up! Controls work great and the bidet can be gentle or powerful if needed. Night light is also really helpful for when you need to go in the middle of the night.

My ONLY gripe with it (and it's not really the companies fault) is that we have a round toilet and it can be pretty cramped as a guy. Otherwise 10/10 would recommend"
"Maybe I hyped myself up for it way too much, I am not sure. But I was heavily disappointed after my first use. I was extremely excited for this upgrade. My old bidet was a simple $50 one with no temperature settings, and no butt dryer. That was what I was the most excited for. The butt dryer. Even ran around telling my friends in family that my butt dryer was finally ordered. It arrived, I rushed to install it, I had to look up a video due to those rubber plugs having zero explanation as to how to get them into the holes. Thank you, YouTube. Installation also could of been a breeze if the nuts were wing nuts instead. No trying to get a big old wrench in such a tight spot, you know? After following the instructions to a ""T"", I finally got to sit down and test out my new luxury purchase. Water on, and I noticed immediately it was VERY soft. So I turned up the pressure ALL the way. Really? My last one was damn near a pressure washer, and this thing felt like a butterfly just brushed by my butt. The heat function, perfect, seat warmer, perfect, installation, could be improved, water pressure, absolute failure. I at least expected to have the water pressure of a garden hose, not a high school water fountain.
But then, I remembered, the number one reason I got this product, so I turned that butt dryer on, and poof. I hear it on.. But I feel nothing? So I turn up the fan, and again... barely anything.... I thought the vein may pop from my forehead. I read the instructions again, says the dryer runs for 3 minutes, and you may want to pat dry before using for best results. Really? The whole point of me getting the butt dryer was so that I wouldn't have to pat dry at all! If I wanted to air dry, then I would just sit there for 15 minutes. I don't even know what to do now. Sit in the corner and cry? Question all of my life choices? Should I have gotten the upgraded version of this one? Would it have been the same? Do I keep it? Do I return it? It might be more satisfying to burn it in a burn barrel. I don't even know anymore."
"Update #2 (July 30, 2022):
Again, mine didn't make it to 2 years before it stopped working - just stopped (another reviewer indicated the same). Initially, I was going to get another one, mainly due to price. However, I decided to go with another brand, and I am so glad I did. As I originally stated, the Alpha is a good ""entry"" bidet, but now that I have gotten the BioBidet, it is sturdier (seat does not make all the squeaking sounds when sitting on it), and the warranty is much better (I wouldn't be dead in the water after less than two years). Also, my new brand has all of the same features but with greater support (e.g., a 2-speed fan, more temperature settings, deodorizer, and more). So, I have adjusted my star-rating, accordingly. I really struggled between 3 and 4 stars, but since I initially thought it was so good, I went with 4.

Original post:
Love all of the features the remote control provides. Love having buttons on the actual seat, too. Many options. The dryer is not very effective, but that’s no big deal for us. Overall, satisfied!!

Update #1 (July 2022): Well, we didn't make it to two years. It has died! Oh boy! Guess I will get another one! It worked well until last week; no water from nozzle."
"This is my second electric bidet, the first of this brand. It seems to work reasonably well but with some cautions. I’ll list my assessment:

Pros: very sturdy seat, seems well made; good stream pressure; better drying than my other one but still not that useful; the stream can oscillate on any setting which is a great feature; hot water doesn’t seem to run out; easy install;

Cons: remote is very cheap and the tabs on the battery door bend over instantly - not likely to last through a battery change - not critical I suspect since the door should still close; the water adapter does not have a shutoff to the bidet which would be convenient when going on vacation to ease draining the bidet; the seat sits higher than normal, causing a problem for men while seated - this design flaw appears to have been noticed by the manufacturer since they put a lip on the underside of the front of the seat. You have to be sure to install the seat with this lip well before the edge of the bowl. None of this is in the instructions."
"Install was somewhat simple. All hardware that was included was 1/2"" all of my connections were 3/8"". So it took a trip to Home Depot. I ordered the round and from what I can tell they are all made for elongated but they fit on a round it just kinda has about an inch of bowl peaking out. Not crazy about that but it is what it is. The only other complaint I have is the water pressure is markedly less than my old non electric cheap bidet. Everything else is perfect, heated seat, water temp, night light."
I ordered for my boyfriend because he is always on the toilet and feels the need to shower after going #2. He loves it and says he feels like it cleans good enough that he doesn't need to shower after. I love the heated seats and the front and back wash. The only complaint would be that the dryer doesn't really blow to really dry you
"Following the installation instructions resulted in the seat snapping into the mounting bracket prematurely, and a bit of panic before we found the unlock button. They really need to revise the instructions. Once we understood what we were doing, though, it was quite easy.

The wash cycle is nice, hot water is only sufficient for one wash cycle, then you need to give it time to reheat. Not usually a problem except when we're in a rush in the morning.

The blow dry is inadequate to dry your rear in any reasonable amount of time. Takes several cycles to accomplish it, unless you use toilet paper to sop up most of the water first. This was the one disappointment.

The light is convenient when I need to piss at night, but is generally much too bright, I need to keep the bathroom door closed in order to get any sleep.

The seat cover is JUST a cover, much too flimsy to risk sitting on. Strange place to go cheap.

Over all I love it, I'm kicking myself for not getting a bidet years ago. Will be getting another for the main bath, so our 12 year old stops using the master bath."
"I had tried to use a couple other brand of hybrid bidet seats before alpha's and they were a nightmare to try and install and having somewhere between a traditional round and elongated, none of them fit quite right. Alpha's installation looked daunting at first, but it was a relatively easy setup and after getting everything situated, I used it. I've used bidets in japan before, so it wasn't completely new, but having the warm water and the time to just relax makes me wish I had had one of these years ago.
I will say I had an issue with a nozzle motor failure about 2 weeks ago, and at the time of writing this, their customer support has already identified the issue, and the part was replaced without issue, and the design of the hybrid's frame installation makes it so much easier to remove than I had even realized prior to needing to repair it. At this point, I can safely say that if you're going for a hybrid this is the one to get feature wise, and if you like the peace of mind of competent and comprehensive customer support, they have it. It's already paid for itself in terms of the previous cost of toilet paper. 10/10, would buy again."
"I’m a spoiled brat that loves her bidet. I don’t know how I ever lived without this thing but I LOVE IT! Very easy to instal, easy to use, good size and great stability! Everyone needs one in their bathroom."
"This has been a body-saving product and a money saving product. Greatly reduces irritation & using toilet paper. You will have to get accustomed to not using toilet paper & feel clean without it though.

There are many control options, including a lesser spray for even a child. I would give it a 5, except for a couple of things. 1. For the price, there should b either a continual small light on remote or at least have a function light come on, once you hit a particular function. There ARE lights that come on (very briefly) to indicate water & seat temp though.

One other odd thing. The first stream of water is warm, but should you decide a 2nd stream is necessary, it isn’t cold, but more lukewarm. Not a deal breaker though. Good functional product so far."
"WARNING!!!!
WONDERFUL FEATURES.
BOUGHT FEBUARY 2021 BROKE SEPTEMBER 2023.
FIRST THE SEAT LID LOWERING DEVISE BROKE JUNE 2023. AUGUST 2023 THE SEAT DEVELOPED A 4 INCH LONG BREAK THAT WAS SHARP. AND WOULD CUT YOUR LEG."
"FYI: I have two the the deluxe BioBidet BB-2000 (which I love). I needed a less expensive option for the basement bathroom that had most of the features of my other bidets.
PROS:
1. Controls are very intuitive... except I wish they'd allow you to default your settings (most people prefer oscillation which it has, but you have to remember to hit the button twice each time).
2. Warm water, just for a bit though, but enough.... BioBidet is unlimited on warm water.
3. Love the nightlight inside the toilet. BioBidet is on the side, but I still like that too.
4. Powerful enough... Even though the biobidet has the strongest water pressure, I rarely use it's highest setting. This device's highest pressure setting is about the level 3 or 4 (out of 5) of the BioBidet... but plenty to clean up.

Now, I received a broken unit (nozzle was detached). Customer service from bidetking was exceptional. They sent me a part and I took the option to repair my own device. They responded with a PDF, photos with instructions, and replied back exceptionally fast. All is well now.

Good product for a mid-range... probably the best for it's price-range.

Pay attention to measurements. I'm actually using the round version on a Gerber elongated toilet and it fits perfect."
"Very easy to install, I love the remote option it keeps it out of the hands of guests and kids. Toilet seat warmer is a nice touch. Lots of options for nozzle positions and pressure. Water comes out nice and warm. Really saving on toilet paper I'm basically just patting dry really gets in there. And it self cleans before and after cleaning yourself."
"Bought April 2022, it is now mid February 2024.

A couple weeks ago the heating features, water and seat no longer work. It's also starting to make unusual sounds when spraying. Manufacturer warranty is only 1 year so we are out of warranty to get it fixed."
"Got this for my man for his birthday and he loves it! Looked at the instructions before purchasing to get actual dimensions and they we true to size. I have an American Standard toilet, Round. If my tank wasn't so far forward it wouldn't fit 100% but the seat has to sit a bit forward so the lid can open. Remote is larger than I expected but that doesn't matter. Wish the night lite was auto, just stays on all nite and day but not really an issue. Really wish my toilet style was oblong so that there was more of an opening to sit. The round is has a smaller seat to compensate for the attachments but still cool. Round seat set up, probably wouldn't be comfortable for someone of not average size. Nite light is not as bright as the picture my camera really brought out the whiteness of the bowl, I feel it's the perfect brightness at nite,it's not blinding. The seat heater doesn't seem to auto shut off ,hope that doesn't become a future issue, will recommend if it does."
"Le doy las gracias a la persona que dió todos los detalles de como funciona el bidet y como puedes desactivar la luz nocturna, ya que en las instrucciones no dicen nada."
"did alot of research and went with this model. it has all of the features on my wishlist such as; heated seat, endless heated water, strong water pressure, oscillating spray, heated air dryer, self-clean, all functions adjustable with the included remote control, blue illuminated bowl, soft close lid, and more, for about half the price of higher end models. id recommend this unit to everyone. probably one of, if not THE most feature-packed bidets in its price range. would buy again."
"I've been rocking a very basic, nonelectric, bidet for a a few years now and loved it! Wanted to treat myself and have an upgrade. This right here makes your experience on the potty feel LUXURIOUS! The remote is super easy to understand, installation was a breeze, and the warmth of the water and seat are consistent!

The ability to have the nozzle oscillate was a feature I did NOT know I needed! It is so good!

And now we can air dry! That was the primary complaint when guests would come over and use the bathroom, not feeling comfortable without their bottom being completely dry, and now it is a nonissue!

I have zero issues with this product so far. I was concerned by some reviews, and time will tell how it holds up, but after using it for a few weeks, this is incredible for the price."
"I waited a while to make sure it continued to work well. It’s my first, and the heat and stream seem perfect. I haven’t had any issues. The hardest thing to get used to is the smaller bowl. I would buy again."
"I am comparing this to another bidet in our household. I purchased this one on the promise of continuous hot water due to the ""hybrid heating"" system. The initial cold water blast does not occur on our other bidet. The remote control is too large. I would have contacted the seller but there was no way to do it from My Orders page."
We had purchased an Alpha Bidet before and we’re Avery happy with its performance so we decided to buy 3 more units for the 3 other toilets we have at home. Unfortunately the ix hybrid were the only models available in stock. It only took me an average of 15 minutes to install each unit. They all perform well except for one unit where the remote control intermittently fails. I may need a new remote control for this one unit. The blue night light is a bonus but have to figure out how to turn it off during the day. The water pressure and water volume are lower for this model compared with the non remote control model. I prefer the non remote control model over this hybrid model.
"Overall, I like this bidet, but my water temperature does not work anymore it's always cold."
"I installed this bidet just over a week ago and have so far been pleased. One challenge I encountered during the installation, which I was not expecting, was that the supplied T-adapter just would not thread completely onto the supply line. As I wasn't certain if the problem was the T- adapter or the supply line, I bought a new supply line and a T-adapter with a valve. When I received both it was apparent that the supplied T-adapter was the issue and that there must be a problem with the threading on the inlet as it only allows for a couple of turns (and there was no way I was cross threading anything). With the new T-adapter I was able to finish the installation without issue.

So overall, it seems to function well, but I have limited experience so far and will update this review if there is an issue. I am, however, perturbed I needed to order a separate part to finish the installation."
"This bidet has all the features you would want and a decent price. Unfortunately, I haven't had this for a year yet and now the toilet seat is cracking all over. I live in a household of two and the heaviest person is 155# I didn't expect to have to replace this every year! I have opened a support ticket, if they handle this well, I will update my review, but reading other reviews where they required the broken seat to be sent back at the buyers cost, I am not expecting much.

Update: they provided me with a replacement seat I installed it and we are back up and running. Not happy with it breaking but I am happy they took care of the problem."
I purchased this item for a number of reas installed within a week. I have had few issues with it since it was installed. The one minor complaints that I would have about this. Is? That. If it were aiming for my front it does not always quite reach that area. That being said I'm always able to finagle myself into the correct position.
"This was fairly easy to install but could have a better picture of which direction the arrow goes on the plastic mount. Figured out it points to the front. Metal bushings were a little large to fit through the mounting holes of the bowl and had to use a dremel to enlarge the hole.
The warm water and seat are great. The oscillating feature on this biden washes me completely leaving no cling-ons and leaves me clean. Front wash is nice and gentle besides being warm. It auto shuts off after a minute.
The drying fan is noisy and pretty much useless. It does blow warm air but after 3 minutes still wet.
Highly recommend this biden butt washer."
"This was a nice bidet until it stopped working. The warm seat helped in the winter and the nightlight was convenient. It cleaned well and was easy to install.
My only gripe is that after about a year and 1/2 of normal use the wand no longer extended and then a day later more features stopped working. The warranty is one year 😢"
"So it was the Corona-virus and TP shortage of 2020 that inspired us to buy one of these, but man, how the hell have I lived my entire life without one of them? Holy Crap! No pun intended, but these are definitely the holy grail of bottom maintenance. The power of the washing wand almost makes me want to linger for a 2nd cycle every time! Plus, I always feel clean down there, like I'm taking a new shower every time I poo. In the past I've been gradually becoming more and more aware of how ineffective TP alone is on my poopy bum, so now I am completely satisfied that my cornholio is clean and fresh. This is a fantastic bidet with so many features and it doesn't feel cheaply done at all. Between the heated seat and multiple power-wash options and a blow dryer! Although the blow dryer isn't as pleasant as it sounds. Imagine blowing poopy-smelling air up to your nostrils. It gets the job done though, and drys your bum so your TP isn't as wet when you wipe. Yes, I still use TP to make sure everything got scoured away. Sometimes, clay-like poo, doesn't get completely removed and must be re-done, but most of the time it does. And who doesn't enjoy a 2nd round of power washing into your hole of poo? Very enjoyable! Thanks for making such a great product. Extremely satisfied."
Works great but the seat cracked and broke.
"the unit is very well built and works great. however, because of the way they packaged the unit with the electronic and control box , the actual seating area is reduced especially for men . My wife has no problem with it at all. but when I use it i have hard time positioning my self so my front dose not hit the toilet bowel ... this also could be the toilet bowel we have which is a nigari stealth flush model elongated bowel. just keep this in mind when ordering ."
"This was a good bidet for the amount of time it worked.
Pros:
1. Multiple adjustable wand lengths
2. Pressure was good pulsating
3. Beautiful blue toilet seat light
4.adjustable water temp
5. Adjustable seat warmer
6. Multiple user settings i.e. female, rear, child, rear plus
Cons:
It no longer works. It started with one setting not working properly then another setting started stop working eventually non of the water motor settings on the bidet worked anymore.
-the toilet seat discolored with tiny permanent spots within a month or so after purchase
- women setting didn't quite allow the water to reach the front
I thought wow for all the money spent on this bidet it should still be working"
"My device no longer turns on..
I opened the cover to see if there was any kind of fuse, or burnt wire or some indication of why it just stopped working. Everything looked good inside. I could check continuity if they had a troubleshooting manual available. But they don't. And getting a warranty repair started is not a simple thing to do. First, nobody seemed to want to help me. I felt like they are just hoping I will stop following up until the warranty is expired. To me it seems like these things are not designed to last, they want customers that provides residual income The problem with that is they are wasting resources and filling up landfills. I think we all should demand quality long lasting products that last decades
and not accept cheap easy to break products. I asked them to send me a link for a troubleshooting manual or a detailed wiring diagram. They make sure that we pay all the shipping cost involved with the warranty so the charge $35 and they say they will charge an additional $50 if they decide it needs to be steam cleaned All I know to do is wipe it with Clorox wipe but I don't want to submerse in water and void the warranty. This makes me nervous because they could determine that this is not covered under the warranty I wish they would just send me a troubleshooting manual and replace whatever part is bad. That way I could fix it my self, and not risk paying more money to lose my Bidet."
"It works ok, plastic feels kinda cheap. I don’t like that it leaves water on the seat in the back and the biggest issue is the little door to the dryer doesn’t swing open when the fan is activated. My wife likes the front part though."
Love the warm seat! Love the warm water! But I don't like the super soft hardware bolts for attaching the seat. It is not a tight fit so the seat moves alot. Also the spray nosal is not a one size fits all. We are not all made the same....I have to use the famine wash for my bum...the back one sprays to far back for me...(I have a big bum) 😉. The dryer doesn't dry all the way so you have to use it multiple times. Now on the other hand my kid likes the child settings. I would definitely buy this again.
"The bidet arrived promptly following our order, is easy to install and has all the features my wife will use. Unlike some products I ordered, no extra parts were needed. The only problem I ran into is that the bidet would not work when I first installed it. I called the service line and got a human voice very quickly. The technician suggested that I point the remote toward the bidet rather than toward the wall. When I did, it worked fine. The technician suggested that the walls must be absorbing the signal rather than letting it bounce. The commode area is small but had a fairly dark brown flat coat of paint when we bought the place and the explanation made sense, especially when we put a mirror on the wall in front of the commode and the remote worked well when pointed at the mirror. I believe a coat of semi-gloss pant, preferably a lighter color, will solve the problem. (I have always disliked the dark brown walls and five years ago, had planned to repaint the space - - when I got around to it . . . )"
"This is a very high end bidet that is very reasonable. I do not know what the endurance is but for now, it is very wonderful. The water could be a little warmer, but it’s fine, especially after my last one conked out and only shot cold water. Pucker factor tight. Lol I consider myself a connoisseur of bidets so I can be relied on to tell you so far this is worth the money. The coolest thing is it sounds really neat. It sounds very high tech and a little bit futuristic. Lol."
"Love the night light, seat warmer, adjustable water temp. The only downside is that I wish the blower was stronger. Still occasionally use a couple squares to dry front area."
"One part that wasn't a breeze about installation was how you are suppose to put those rubbers that go into the toilet holes. Literally suppose to stick each of that from each toilet's hole from bottom to top--that way you are left with it look like there are rubber washers on the toilet. It does not say that in the instruction. Another part that was bad is when you are trying to align the bidet. It's more of a guessing game so you have to align it a certain way and that means adjusting the screws tediously till you find the right lining for your toilet. Which sucks...

I don't know why this rating is asking for softness because this bidet is hard. Like it should be for all toilet covers -_-

But after the hassle of installing from mainly those two parts > it's easy to use! My boyfriend bought one for our apartment and I got one for our parents. What a luxury to have warm water and heated seats on cold days and vice versa."
"Bought this for my new apartment and I love it. I’ve never felt cleaner and use way less toilet paper than ever! Hot water is decent it’s only hot for a few seconds than gets just warm.

Heated seat is wonderful."
This bidet works great but it is so noisy that you can’t use it without announcing to the whole house you are washing your butt. Nobody uses it because of this.
"It worked wonderfully for the time I had it. I never review back ticket items like this until maybe a year or so down the road, and this is exactly why.

I bought this item in December 2021, and as mentioned before, all the settings worked great, the water heater worked instantly, and the fan had no problems. It is now February 2022, and for no reason whatsoever the pump stopped working and the water pressure fell to almost nothing. After troubleshooting it for about an hour, I have come to the conclusion that these products are probably built only for a warranty period that runs out after a year. This is not fact but just my opinion until I see that this has been just an unlucky fluke.

I have contacted the company and will update once a resolution has been made.

**Update

So it's been over a week with customer service back and forth. The final stand is them offering a ""discounted"" price to ship it ($35), plus the repair bill of whatever the issue is, and lord knows how long it will actually take to get it back or if they will even do the right job the first time. If you buy this pack of junk, make SURE you buy the extended warranty. There is a reason why the warranties go as long as 1 year, they are literally assembled to fail. Will be buying a new one from a different company since all I have now, with the water pressure not working at all, is a glorified seat warmer. What a perfect example of a bad company."
I absolutely love this toilet seat. I had a manual one previously and this is hands down one of the best purchases ever.
"Play Video
 Well...I try to live by ""happy wife, happy life"", so I finally gave in and bought a bidet. This one looked like it had some really nice features. I was worried about the install because the space between the seat holes and tank front met the minimum requirement, but it works and the seat stays open because when it gets to a certainn spot, there is a catch to keep it from closing. (You might be able to see it in the video) Our toilet is an American standard cadet. Anyway, the install was fairly simple. The only issue was that the water cable did not want to screw on to the bidet. Turns out the water filter that is installed on the bidet inlet was sticking out a touch too far. I pushed it in further and it screwed on the hose without issue. All connections were water tight on the first try and the power was pretty easy...cuz I just plugged it in!

Bidet installed! I myself haven't tried it, but my wife says it is fantastic. Warm water...check. Warm seat...oh yeah! No toilet paper required. Maybe I will try it one day."
"I used to work high end residential hvac and I remember this house with a 25k toilet. Yeah to this day I'll never forget the experience and never felt more clean. That was 4 years ago and now I found this. It gives me the heated seat, heated water with great pressure, and the night light. Just figuring out hose adapters was the only difficult part but lowes/homedepot will have something that will work. If your considering getting one of these and your reading this, just get it you will have 0 buyers remorse."
"We’ve used this bidet for a few months now and it is a wonderful addition to our bathroom!

The warm seat is very nice on cold Winter nights. Once in awhile, it initially shoots a cold blast of water, but for the most part, it is warm. The temperature, water pressure and position is adjustable to one’s needs.

The seat doesn’t fit as perfectly as we hoped on our toilet, but we have since gotten accustomed to it and it doesn’t leak, so there aren’t any major problems except appearance when opened. The soft close seats are very nice.

The blue light is nice, especially at night, so there is no need to turn on any lights, especially for the male members of our household.

It also comes with a remote holder that can be affixed on the wall nearby for easy use.

I feel it is worth every dollar we paid and seriously considering adding another to our guest bathroom."
"Update: I was able to fix the bracket but the seat is still small.
I really wanted to like this Bidet but the seat is way too small and very uncomfortable, install was very difficult, I could never get the bolts tight enough and the seat moved around."
"This was purchased for my disabled husband. It does the job well The dryer does not work as good as expected. The plastic lid feels a bit cheap. We were disappointed in the remote because the battery cover will not stay on and now that it is all assembled, we don't want to take it all apart to send it back just because of the battery cover. It has a lot of great features for the price including a glowing blue night light."
"****update..year and a half later and no problems. Good product.**** Seat opens weird to make room for tank and pump so limits pee pee room when standing. Closes awkwardly. That said, number 2 is a happy time with the seat warmer toasting the buns, and the booty blaster shining up the dumpster portion. I use much less toilet paper which makes my septic tank happy. Down side is my wife now takes twice as long in the bathroom trying out all the buttons. Be sure to have a spare bathroom before installing or add a ejection seat feature to free up bathroom space from ""loitering"" phone addicts."
"Supposed heated water quits halfway and make sure that you sit towards the left side regardless. I’ve had $30 ones with better aim…you can adjust up and down but not left or right.

Weird leaving reviews like this. Lol.

Happy awkwardly shifting."
"I bought an Alpha iX and another bidet (brand starts with a B) a year ago when we moved into our house. In that year it's performed really well; the remote is great, and the seat has been performing really consistently. The settings are saved between power outages and the remote is nice and easy to understand.

I liked it so much I just bought another one to replace that ""other"" bidet, which is now in our guest bathroom."
"I am a male and a first time Bidet user. I am glad that I took the step to try something new. I love this thing. Quick and super easy to install. Everything I needed was included so it took me about 15 minutes. No leaks first time! Yea! Electrical cord is about 3 ft long which was plenty for my installation. The remote control is intuitive and very handy as it controls all the functions. Adjustable temp for the comfortable heated seat. Water temp and water pressure controls are awesome. Water pulse, a slightly wide spray and a narrow stream all controlled from the remote. This product works flawlessly and is well worth the investment. I heartily recommend this excellent Bidet. Wish I would have had it during the toilet paper shortage caused by the terrible CCP Virus."
"Wow, this was a great purchase! Fairly easy to install (knowing a little about plumbing helps), and the features are endless and amazing! Adjustable spray, heated water and seat, and a warm air blower that helps clear much of the water. It has a lovely blue night light, and never seems to run out of warm water - and there’s no initial cold spray, either. It has a self-cleaning mode, too. The remote is neat, but mostly lives on the cabinet right beside the toilet where it’s easy to use without taking it out of the bracket. It’s nice that you can place the remote in a comfortable spot, unlike some units with the controls affixed and in an inconvenient spot. Love this thing!"
"This item bidet seat works really well with all the bells and whistles but there are issues. This seat cracked in the rear center on top and right side underneath. Also unrelated to the cracks the soft close lid quit working. The warranty is useless as the manufacturer wants to charge for EVERYTHING. By reading the warranty on their site you can clearly see that you would save money by buying a new seat. My seat has been great and functions just fine. From reading reviews on other brands, it seems all have fatal issues. These seats are apparently a novel item and not perfected well enough for sale. I am very disappointed in this bidet seat and the warranty. Don't waste your money on these things until the manufacturers can learn how to properly build these things."
"I bought this for my daughter right before she had her 1st baby. She has told me over and over again that I couldn't have got her a better gift. As soon as you set on this seat it's so warm and comfortable. She loves it, her husband loves it, I love it, her brothers and sister's love it, my girlfriend loves it, my ex-wife loves it and everyone that visits loves it. She needs to start charging people to use this thing. LOL!"
Don’t have to say much about this Bidet. We bought two more!!
The bidet works great but the seat cracked on one very quickly. The seat is also a bit small but ya get used to it. I see alot of people talking about water pressure being low. Idk what their talking about I can't put it to 50% power bc any higher feels like it's penetrating you lol. Thats not a issue. Overall the bidet functions as it says and its a steal for the money as long as they fix this seat issue on the one quickly. I'll update my review on how they handle the seat crack and what happens. I've never had a toilet seat crack in my life so this is a bit odd to me but they also weren't heated either. Long as they replace it im happy if not then that says alot about the seller. It's less than 60 days.
"It has all the features you would expect at this price, the bonus is the hybrid warm water system. It's not a commonly available on a bidet at this price point. The fact that the price was lowered by $40 after I made my purchase annoyed me a bit. It comes with a 1 year manufacturer warranty whis is pretty standard. It will probably will last 2 years of normal use. I added a 4 year extended warranty. Based on my experience, it was cheap insurance."
pretty easy to install. the night light is ALWAYS on and there is no way to turn it on/off with the controller. I would prefer to be able to turn it on/off rather than it always being on. not much of a difference between front/rear cleaning with the water stream direction.
"When all the idiots were hoarding toilet paper. This thing is great! Only hitch to the install was that I had to piggyback an outlet near the toilet in order to plug it in. But the toilet install was no problem. Only fault I can find is that there is a washer that goes on the water supply split that is not very clearly marked where it should be. First attempt was wrong and got a leak. But figured it out and have had no problems since. Features on this thing are awesome. Do keep in mind as other reviews have mentioned, the ""fan"" is NOT going to dry you off. Yes it will help dry a little but you will still need to wipe to dry off."
"This is my first bidet. I am in love with the way it cleans. The reason I gave 3 stars is because it’s not a never ending stream of warm water. I spent the extra money to get a warm water stream bidet. If you run the bidet 2x in a row, the 2nd go round is cold. It’s supposed to be a hybrid to avoid that."
"Play Video
 Unit offers a lot of features for the money, we bought it and lived using it, however after only 9 monthhs of use the unit broke. Thinking this was a one off defect, we ordered a second one and in under a year it broke again (in the same area as the first one did). Contacting the manufacturing got us a 15% discount on a third unit, that only applies if we purchase frotm them, where the prices are inflated (units in Amazon are discounted so manufacturer offered no real remedy). Bottom line with this is you get what you pay for, features are appealing but just know this will become something you have to replace annually if you purchase."
"Overall: I'd buy again

I've had this for about 3 or 4 months now. Super easy install for someone with plumbing knowledge and an easy install for someone who is non-knowledgeable. Toughest part is turning off the water to add the 3 way adapter.

The heated seat will make you never want to go back. Heated water is just a plus. All controls work.

This was my first bidet and I've heard bad things about the non electric ones. Just uncomfortable.

Bad: it takes up a little big of space on the toilet."
"Having traveled extensively to Asia, I can no longer live without bidets. I've purchased $900 seats, $500 seats, and $30 attachments. For me, the most important features I look for now are 1) a strong spray 2) consistent warm water and 3) sturdy seat.

This ix hybrid hits all three points for me. I tried other brands in this price range and the spray is either too soft, or the water doesn't stay warm throughout. I took a chance on the ix because we have their other model JX in another house. That one's been great so we were excited to try this new one for our home in Vegas.

The spray is solid, the temp stays warm and it feels sturdy enough. The lid doesn't feel flimsy either. My wife prefers the regular rear wash and I like the stronger rear+ mode. I wasn't aware it had a dryer when I bought it, but it's on there as well. The blue led light is just the icing on the cake. Great product at any price."
Be better if nite light could be on timer. It is either on 24/7 or have to remember to turn on each night.
"I only bought the bidet as an added bonus to the heated toilet seat! Wonderful item! Love it. Way better than expected. Enjoying the go.I did purchase the extended warranty because of all the heated seats I have had, they tend to burn out after 2yr. I put the seat on myself and have not had one problem in 6 mo. I have had it. Also, the seat itself has an inner lip that keeps urine from leaking between seat and rim. Stays cleaner than reg seat and my granddaughter can use it since it has kid setting and pix on remote."
I absolutely love this product. I Collett going to the pool. It gets rid of that swampy feeling and leaves me feeling fresh and clean.
"Seat is smaller, this is my first bidet seat for my elongated toilet but with this installed it makes seat smaller, more like a round toilet seat. I love it besides that, the seat stays warm all the time unless on eco mode, I love the remote & it also had 3 buttons on the side of seat. Easy to install but you have to have a gfi outlet near toilet, I had to install one like most people will so that is an expense you need to factor in. Overall all love it, warm water, warm toilet seat, night light, air dryer but in my experience you won't fully get rid of toilet paper."
First one i ever used im 70 yrs old it is comfortable. I hope the electronic s hold up. When i got it the box was beatup.i think they need to put a larger.fradgel sticker on package.
This is our second Bidet from Alpha and the first one lasted 3+ years. The new Bidet only lasted 5 months. Small plastic pieces started to fall off about 4 months after we installed it and I couldn't figure out where they were coming from until a hose started slowly leaking. The hose that enters the bidet finally gave out one day and water was spraying all over the bathroom. It was a good thing that we were still at home as it would have flooded the bathroom. I reached out to Alpha and have had no response back as to any warrenty or if problem can be fixed. Very disappointed.
We were visiting a buddy and he had one of these. My wife and I loved it so much we ordered one that arrived at our house before we got back. It took about 20 minutes to install. Not much harder than installing a new toilet seat. Instructions were spot on!
"I am a female in her 60s and I was able to install this on my own in about 15 minutes. Very quick and easy install! The seat takes some getting used to since the mechanics of the bidet are in back, you sit with what feels like a little tilt and this also creates a smaller opening than what you may be used to....small overall adjustment. The upward flow isn't a heavy as I would prefer but being an add-on, I guess it's as much as can be expected. The warming of the water is immediate and you definitely have to have an electrical outlet close to your toilet (luckily, I do). The nozzel movement isn't noticable to me so I have to adjust myself to have the water ""hit the right spot"" in the front region. I honestly went back and forth trying to decide if I wanted to keep it or not. I decided to keep it since I don't think other models will be much of an improvement and American Standard is a trusted name in toilets."
The water line does not fit onto a standard toilet connection. The box nut is too small. Going to a plumbing warehouse to try to get an adapter…. (sigh).
This has got to be one of the best purchases I’ve ever made. I always say that will be a sign of when I have “arrived” is when I own a bidet. That day is here! I recommend to everyone! No need for toilet paper in the apocalypse!!!
"we bought two units trusting that the product would work as advertised. The positive experience was the support provided by Amazon installation support otherwise this is a product that stinks. Two units bought a year ago never worked as advertised, support from American Standard is non existent and it is a waste of anyone's money to buy and install this product."
"We have been using a bidet similar to this one but made by a different company for several months and absolutely love it. So when we saw this one I immediately recommended it to my parents, thinking that they too would really love having one. This one is about twice to price of the one we currently have and has basically all the same features.

So, we took it down to their house over Thanksgiving and I installed it, which was very simple, just as ours was. You simply remove your existing toilet seat, mount the bidet, connect the water line, and plug it into an outlet. Installation took 10 minutes at most, and thank goodness for that because it wasn't long after that I would be un-installing it.

The first thing I noticed when I took this bidet out of the box was that it is HUGE! The one we have looks almost like a standard toilet seat whereas this one has this enormous seat cover that goes way out beyond the seat itself (so it looks much bigger and takes up considerably more space.) In additional to that, the back part behind the seat itself where all of the 'guts' are is also huge in both height and depth; it takes up so much more room than the bidet we have, which again has all the same features that this one has. This has a two-fold impact; first, it makes the toilet seat very small (I'd say as small or smaller than a stand round seat) and it is so high in the back that you feel like you're sitting on the edge of a hill. I simply cannot understand how anyone thought that the design of this thing would be good.

After I installed it (and before my Mom came in to look at it.) I did test out all of the modes and features of the bidet and they all works as expected; no problems at all with operation. The remotes is very easy to use and also works well. One note about the remote; unlike most I've seen this one is horizontal, so it is quite awkward to operate as a handheld remote and would be better mounted to a wall next to the toilet. Mounting wasn't an option for them because their bathroom is the typical setup with sink, toilet, shower, all in the row, so there is no wall beside the toilet to mount it to and they already have their paper holder on the side of the vanity. It's another design thing I don't care for, but could have worked well in our bathroom where we have a separate room for the toilet and walls on either side. The bidet we have has a remote more like a TV remote setup, which would likely be easier hold and use. I don't consider this a pro or con, just wanted to point this out so anyone considering this would know.

The overall quality of the bidet seems very good, but honestly no better than the one we have in our home that was half the cost. Also, the company went above and beyond to ensure that the unit was well-packaged and arrived damage-free.

So, testing complete, my Mom hated it from the start (and she really wanted one of these), so I removed it and put their old seat back. I also don't like it due to its design, so I don't not plan to install it at our house either (still love the one we have; it was half the cost but much better design.)

I personally cannot recommend this product, but your mileage may very. I hope this information is helpful in making an informed decision."
"First, I'd like to say that this bidet seat has been an absolute game-changer. The dual nozzles provide a thorough clean, while the warm air dryer adds an extra layer of comfort. I especially appreciate the instant warm water feature - no more chilly surprises! The personalized sprays also mean that everyone in the house can tailor their experience. I couldn't recommend this product highly enough!"
"Overall impression: It's a nice, easy to install and easy to clean bidet with some nice features, but I'm not sure it's worth the price compared to a cheap non-electric bidet. It feels like it's meant for an elongated bowl. I'm not sure that I'll keep this bidet.

Pros:

Heated water - Some people don't like the idea of using room temperature water to clean themselves. It's never really bothered me. To make everyone in the family happy though, having heated water is a nice thing.

The nozzles clean themselves before and after every use, and hide away when not in use. This prevents material from building up on them, and gives you some assurance that they're clean.

Easy to remove seat makes cleaning around and behind the bidet easy. I hadn't realized how much material built up behind my other bidet until I completely removed it. With this bidet, you push a button on the side of the seat, slide it forward, and you can completely remove the bidet to completely clean the bowl.

Cons:

I didn't have an electric outlet near my toilet so on top of paying for a pricey bidet, you may also have to pay for an electrician to install an outlet for you which may need to be on it's own circuit because of the power requirements for heating the seat, water, and blow dryer.

This bidet didn't say it needed an elongated bowl but it just doesn't fit right on my standard bowl. I had to move it forward so the lid and seat could rise properly, and then the front of the seat hangs off my bowl some. To compromise, I moved the seat back closer to the tank, but now then I raise the seat, it doesn't always stay up on its own, and I often have to hold the seat up to do my manly business. And when sitting, since the seat overhangs the bowl, I need to ensure to aim backwards. It's just a bit awkward.

The stream from the nozzles doesn't provide much water. Even when I increased the water from my supply line and played with the pressure, it just doesn't seem to provide much water. I can use the position forward and backwards buttons, and use the wide spray option, but I often find myself wiggling around during the wash cycle to get everything clean. My previous bidet provided a solid stream of water, and ensured everything was washed away. I just don't feel as clean with this bidet as my previous one.

Nuetral:

I'm not sure the deodorizing function does much.

I don't use the heated seat because it gets too warm for me.

The blow dryer seems to blow more on your cheeks than down the middle, so I often end up wiping dry.

Start with a $35 temporary, and then see if the extra features here for hundreds more are worth it for you."
"My first go with American Standard products. I bought this bidet seat cover and a toilet for a bathroom remodel. The seat and cover will not stay up. Unfortunately I just installed it and I missed the return/replace date, so I am stuck with a ridiculously expensive bidet and a very expensive American Standard Toilet that I only purchased to go with this bidet seat."
"I have mentioned here before that I am a big lady and I am older. I have had some issues with cleaning my bum well and had thought long and hard about a bidet and wondered how well one would work for me. Well, let me tell you that even at this price point, it is worth it! First, the instructions as that you watch their video - it really wasn't a terrible install, considering. As I just mentioned, I am an older lady, but I have been on my own for many years and am more or less comfortable with most power and hand tools. The seat install was very straightforward and the mounting of the panel just a bit more complicated since I did not have an outlet very close to the toilet. Okay, now for the completed seat - where I live it is just getting to the cold weather and a warm toilet seat is like having a heated driver's seat in your car - such an AHHH moment on a cold day! The adjustable spray nozzles are fantastic! Clean your bum, clean your tinkle (girl) area at the same time - I love it! Stand up with a wet bum? Not a chance! This seat has a dryer so you leave the toilet cleaner, fresher and drier than when you walked in the bathroom (at least most likely...)! Icing on the cake is the nightlight and the no-slam lid. I can't tell you the times I have walked into the bathroom in the night and had to feel for the toilet seat (because I have dry eye syndrome and can't completely open my eyes some nights). Having the nightlight makes it so much easier on ""hitting the mark"" when I sit down. I live alone, but slamming the lid can be annoying if you have small children or light sleepers in your household that might wake them in the night. All in all, I would love to get one of these for each of my family members if I could afford to - it is that great of an experience! So why is it most folks in the United States have never experienced having a bidet in their house? Maybe the price, but considering how basic going to the bathroom is, more people should try it - it really and truly changes how you feel about using the toilet!"
"This is literally the Cadillac of add on SPAlet/Bidet's out there. The listing of features is extensive and having tried them all, they all work flawlessly.

Heated seat? Check.
Completely adjustable heated seat? Check.
Completely adjustable wash and bidet function? Check!
Nightlight? Check!
Adjustable dryer? Check!
Self Cleaning? Check!
Looks elegant? Check!

This thing is simply amazing. I believe if you are handy you can easily install this yourself. If you hire a plumber to install it a reasonable cost should be not more than $150... The thing is that is not perfectly designed and executed is the mounting plate SPAlet Bidet' connection to the existing commode.

The issue is, based on the design and engineering, the plate in my case does not hold the product securely on the commode. That is an important distinction because the product MUST be securely fastened to the toilet, and be held EXACTLY in place or there could be a mess.

I asked my plumber to come back out, (Paxton Plumbing) because the product was sliding all over the toilet and I was concerned something had come loose. Upon examination, Matt found that the mounting plate could NOT be tightened sufficiently because of the little teeth are too small to get a good bite on the adjustable plate. You can only tighten the Phillips head screws so much because they will be stripped if you go at it too tight, or the nylon plate will snap.

Other than that....

This thing is AWESOME!!"
"This bidet is comfortable, practical, and useful to all, but especially if cleaning up is a challenge!! Easy to use all features and it was easy to install!!"
We really like this product. This is our second purchase of the American Standard bidet. We have one in our Arizona home and now one in our Iowa home. I can’t believe we went through life as long as we did without having this wonderful high technology feature in our home. It is so simple to use and absolutely leaves the bum fresh and clean. We also noticed a substantial reduction in TP use with this unit. Usage was cut in half and would be great for septic tank users. Can’t believe that the American public is so sceptical to adopt this wonderful device as the rest of the world has been using these for quite some time.
"This product works fine for its intended purpose, however the seat is made of thin plastic and will crack after the 1 year warranty expires and there is no replacement part, you must buy the entire seat again, zero customer support, do not buy this seat!!!"
"My wife lost here colon and is loose all the time. Wiping made her sore has is was hard to get cleaned up and now she doesn't have to wipe as much as before and we don't use as much TP. I even use it sometime.
Everything is adjustable, water temp, seat temp, nozzle position, water temp, spray strength along with different modes"
Unit worked well for a while then the Bidet wand stuck open so I got a shower when I hit nozzle cleaning. Warranty is only 1 year.
"I installed just after midnight on Jan 1. It was easy to do. My world will never be the same.
I now have a bit of luxury everyday.
Who knew a heated seat would be so nice. Remote control easy to understand and use. Hot water spray is great; the thought of Cold water being sprayed ""there"" just sends chills up my er-ah spine. Refreshing, and just so smart.
I don't need a night light and blow drier for just a few hundred more.
Yes, it is on the large side, but it offers alot.
Try to find the personal reviews on you tube. They are a hoot.
ENYOY!!!"
"This is my first ever SpaLet style seat at home, although I have seen them before in hotels. I wasn't ever comfortable trying out the spray at a hotel because I didn't actually know where the water came from or how they worked, but I did a bunch of research before ordering this and am now a lot more comfortable with the idea of it. In general, I do like it and am glad that I installed it, but it doesn't totally clean down yonder.

Three big things to me after researching were: (1) the water comes straight from the main wall supply, and is stored in an internal tank in the seat where it is heated, (2) the nozzles fully retract under a cover when not in use, and (3) the nozzles are self-cleaning. So, assuming that the internal tank doesn't get grimy, the water should be clean. The nozzles aren't out while you're taking care of business, and they clean themselves (I believe before and after use), so they should also be clean.

Before getting into the pros of this unit, there are some things that I want to point out:
(*) When installed with the seat up, it blocks off about 15% of the opening to the bowl on the side of the toilet tank. I hadn't ever seen an image of what this looks like with the seat up, and that surprised me a bit. Makes sense because the nozzle assembly has to be forward of the lip of the bowl. I just hadn't thought of that
(*) While it does reduce the amount of wiping, it doesn't eliminate it. Maybe I just need to work on my technique, but I've been using it for two weeks now
(*) The internal tank helps reduce the current draw from the outlet compared to a seat that heats the water on demand, but it also means that when the hot water runs out...you're going to get sprayed with cold water. Well, you, or whoever follows you. The cold water is bearable, but definitely not preferable
(*) To state the probably obvious, but I hadn't thought about it before reading someone state it - you need an electrical outlet for this. Like others, I'm currently running an extension cord because I don't have an outlet near my toilet (how many people do?). I do think that I like it enough to install an outlet, though

The things that I really like about it are:
(*) Super easy to install. The most time consuming part for me was totally cleaning the whole toilet and surrounding area. Installing this took maybe ten minutes
(*) Heated seat and water spray, with five different settings for each. I didn't think that I'd care about the heated seat, but I'm digging it. The heated spray, IMO, is an absolute must (see note above)
(*) The self-cleaning retractable nozzles, which I think are standard for this type of seat
(*) It's comfortable to sit on. I'm used to wooden seats and wasn't sure about a plastic one, but I like it. All of the surfaces are nicely rounded
(*) Adjustable nozzle position. Not really a requirement, but it's nice to have
(*) Adjustable spray pressure. You can go from a gentle clean to something more brisk, but none of them are actually abrasive feeling. I was afraid that this would feel like a fire hose on my nether regions, but it absolutely doesn't

Something that I'm neutral on:
(*) The remote. In some ways, it's nice that it isn't right on the seat. But, you need to find a place for it (I currently just sit it on the back of my toilet tank). I think that I'd actually prefer the controls to be on the side of the seat (which is an option that they offer in this seat)
(*) Plastic versus stainless steel nozzles. Sure, I'd like stainless steel, but Toto (the leading brand) also uses plastic, so they must not be that bad

Something that it doesn't have:
(*) Forced air drying. After getting this and researching some more, I learned that other models have heated forced air drying. I think that would be nice, but since I think that you'll need to wipe anyway, wiping away a little water is no big issue to me

I absolutely like it and am glad that I got it, but it's not perfect. Be prepared to still have to do some clean up afterwards, but it does feel better than wiping alone."
"My wife loves this. We just bought one for my mother-in-law, my daughter bought one and my sister-in-law. That's four in less than a year. But the seat is hard plastic, so I don't understand the question ""softness"", however the seat is heated."
"I loved the quality and features of this product but it is way too big in relation to the toilet - it raises the sitting height too much to be comfortable (I have a new ADA compliant toilet), and changes the profile of the toilet, making it look like a geriatric appliance. I switched to a model that is described as 6"" high, compared to this one, described as 9"" high - I believe that refers to the tank on the back of the unit. Much more comfortable and streamlined."
"I purchased an American Standard, because I had American Standard Toilets with elongated bowls and is what American Standard says the toilet seat should fit. You can see in the picture the seat will not go back to cover the bowl. Also I had a professional plumber here to install it (Hiller Plumbing) The seat would not slide in and lock as shown in the instructions. He spent at least 40 extra minutes removing and reinstalling it and final had to place a piece of paper under the mounting plate to get it to lock in. The fact is this seat does not fit a Champion 4 Elongated Right Height One Piece Toilet 1.6 GPF. What a waste! I had to pay a plumber to find out that a $400 American Standard toilet seat does not fit an American Standard toilet."
"This is the fanciest toilet seat I’ll ever own! It is the ultimate luxury. If cleanliness is important to you, this does the job! No complaints except I have had trouble getting the remote to do everything it offers, like moving the nozzle to a different position (forward or backward). It was easy to install and in my opinion worth every cent."
"The concept is awesome but the quality of seat no. We love it how the jobs is done, the control of the temperature all the options that come with.

Unfortunately the actual seat is not the best quality, after 5 months of used it cracked, we contact American Standard and we had a replacement, but it happen the same.

Just in case I weight 145lbs and my husband 185.

Very disappointed of the quality. Check the pictures to see the crack on the bottom."
Amazing!!! Saw this seat at a resort in Hawaii and had to have it. It actually sucks the poop smell even! I saw another review on how it doesn’t fit. Not true! It’s fully adjustable and the guy didn’t read the instructions obviously.
"I have had a bidet for a while and recently moved so I installed this new one yesterday. This morning it left me not clean. There are times that they need some assistance, or you could say usually just a tiny bit, however this is not the case with this unit.

I am not really sure if it did really anything, I will give it another go tomorrow but as of right now its going back."
Works GREAT !!!!!!!!!!
"Ahhhhhhhhh! That is my review in one short word, and it really may be all you need to know about this seat. But for more, please read on.

These types of seats are simply the best thing to happen to toilets since outdoor plumbing. I am so happy with it that I think it would be hard to go back to using just a plain do-nothing toilet seat.

So, why 4 stars and not 5?
The design. The curve up at the back makes it look more like a medical device, or maybe a hospital toilet seat, rather than a luxury toilet seat. It does not have the sleek modern look of similar seats that are flat by design. To me, this seat is function over form, and the form is not as aesthetically appealing to me as I would have liked.

What I Like:
— Relatively easy to install. We had never installed one before, but it wasn't terribly difficult. We were putting it on a Kohler toilet (Archer model with an elongated bowl). The bushings were tricky because they seemed to be too large, but we made a call to the manufacturer who told us how to make them work. After that it was pretty easy, outside of getting squirted by surprise.
— The white matches our white Kohler toilet very well. If there is a difference, it is imperceptible in normal bathroom lighting. (I dislike mismatched whites and that would have bothered me, and others as well, I imagine.)
— The heated toilet seat. Oh, my! Yes! This feature is especially nice if you live where it gets cold at night. It makes other toilet seats feel as if you're sitting on an ice cube.
— The deodorizer. When pressure is applied to the seat, this just turns on and works. You can toss the bathroom spray cans.
— The bidet and cleansing functions. Fully adjustable and both work well.
— Eco-setting - for saving electricity by turning the toilet off for 8 hours. Good for when you are out for the day. This has to be set for each instance. It does not repeat or store any time setting.
— There are numerous water temps and other settings to make a customized experience.
— Nozzle cleaning mode.
— Not much more difficult to clean than a plain toilet.
— Instructions look daunting, but it's actually very easy to use.

What Could Be Better:
Although we tightened the seat as much as we could, the seat moves around if you shift. The various parts themselves have a lot of play, but I would like to feel that what I was sitting on wasn't going to go anywhere. My husband says it won't, but I would be happier if there was less to no wiggle room in that regard.

This is a bathroom game changer. The only thing better would be the design, as mentioned above, and if it raised the seat cover as soon as you entered the room like the hotel ones do. Lol."
"They have an installation video on youtube if you search for ""How to Install the SpaLet Bidet Seat""

I never installed one before and I was able to do it, so it shouldn't be too difficult. Just make sure you obviously shut off the water valve first.

Installation was easy, but the plastic clip cover didn't seem to snap in that securely for me.

- It has a seat sensor, so if you're not sitting down or have your hand on the sensor seat, you don't have to worry about pressing the button and the nozzle spraying by mistake.

- Deodorizing starts when a person sits on the toilet seat. The product contains a cartridge to absorb odors. You can also stop the deodorizer by pressing the 'STOP' and 'Bidet' buttons simultaneously for 2 seconds.

The manual states (on the remote type), to clean the nozzle, to hold the ""Nozzle Cleaning"" button for over 2 seconds, but holding it and pressing it once made no difference for me.

You can adjust the spray strength from 6 levels. 5 Levels for seat and water temperature. There is a small tank that is heated (If you put in power saving mode, you won't get warm spray right away)

I don't really think the spray saves you from using less toilet paper because it does splash a bit and you do have to wipe that down often.

Overall, this is definitely a nice upgrade Do-It-Yourself project for your home. These are very common in Japan, but it's nice to finally have something this nice in my home. It definitely makes going to the bathroom a pleasure and luxurious. For most people, you're going to have to get power cord extensions to power this.

Pros:
- Wireless remote (requires two AA batteries not included); comes with a bracket so you can mount that and also still have the ability to remove the remote from it.
- Built-in deodorizer, so it won't be smelly!
- Massage mode (the way it sprays)
- Adjust spray strength/position
- Adjust seat and water temperature
- The lid closes slowly, so there will never be that annoying slamming noise!
- No worry about mistakenly pressing the spray button and making a mess as there is a sensor

Cons:
- Because of the size (tank for heating up), you do end up sacrificing the bowl space than without it (not good for males who have to go standing up)
- Will still splash even at lowest strength, so you'll have to wipe the seat
- Must completely remove seat to access deodorizer cartridge
- Requires outlet power"
"This bidet seat may have spoiled me. I've gotten so accustomed to a warm toilet seat, that it's quite the adjustment to sit on a cool seat first thing in the morning.

Installation was not too difficult. You'll need a screwdriver, a wrench, and something to catch water in while you're hooking up the water line. It probably took less than ten minutes from start to finish. It was a little bit challenging to get the rubber gaskets into the holes to attach the seat, but that was probably the most challenging part. (I learned that pressing them down while rocking them back and forth helped to secure them in place.) I did have a slight leak when I first attached it, but it was due to not tightening the water connection well enough.

I think my favorite thing about this seat is the heated seat and the heated water. Unlike another bidet I've owned in the past, this one is actually able to heat up the water, which is a definite plus if you don't have easy access to a hot water line. The warm water lasts a few minutes and then takes a few more minutes to heat the next batch of water. It's definitely enough warm water to get the job done.

You are able to control both the temperature and intensity of the spray via the remote control. All functions are controlled by the remote, so you'll need to find a place to mount it - the screws are included.

My only real complaint is that it doesn't get you completely clean on its own. It does a good job, but in my experience, you still need to use some TP."
"Designed to keep its bulk minimal and its look as attractive as possible this bidet seat operates reliably and quickly becomes a welcome addition to the bathroom. The shape of the seat is somewhat unusual and I was concerned it might be uncomfortable, but it is not. The household was already using plastic rather than wood so that aspect of the seat required no adjustment period.

The features like the heated seat, water temperature control, stream position and pressure allow user customization and are pleasant and soothing. If seated for an extended period of time the massage option helps to keep blood flowing in areas that may become numb. The basic process cleanses well for most situations although individual events may occasionally require more or less water, toilet paper, etc.
There is no built-in dryer so a small amount of bathroom tissue is needed to pat dry.

The seat requires a GFCI Outlet located behind the toilet but the instruction booklet states it is safe to use an extension cord from another GFCI outlet so I did that as a temporary measure before having a new outlet installed. For planning purposes, the power cord is three and a half feet long and has a three-prong plug. Also, the seat is designed for an elongated style commode.

The included manual is written clearly and has good illustrations. There are also excellent videos on installation and operation for the device on the company’s website which remove much of the guesswork. Tools needed are an adjustable-end wrench, cross (Phillips) screwdriver along with a flat blade version. Installation is quick and easy although depending upon the age of the toilet and connections some effort may be required in disconnecting the water supply line.

In my case I replaced the fixed supply line that was in place with a flexible one (under six dollars at a local hardware store) which made installing the T connector easier and quicker. Also, it may be worth the time to decide where the remote control will be placed because the location needs to be within reach.

The user-friendly design makes cleaning the basic unit convenient while providing a self-cleaning function for the spray nozzles eliminating what might otherwise be time-consuming maintenance of a delicate mechanism. And, the deodorizer feature requires periodic maintenance which entails removing the filter and cleaning with a toothbrush—all detailed in the manual. Well-built, functional and pleasant to use."
"I'm a first time bidet user, so I cannot compare this to anything else, but I suppose that will suffice.

The box it came in was ridiculously big, like big enough for a whole toilet big. It's just what's pictured however (the seat, the control panel, a hose, and some hardware). Installation involves detaching the supply line, add the T fitting with the bidet's hose attached, attach the bidet hose to the bidet, attach a bracket to toilet, slide bidet on toilet, and add batteries to remote.

It took less than 15 minutes. I'll need to add an electrical outlet (the current extension cord setup lessens the added class of the bidet) later, but if you have an outlet, you're golden.

The controls on the remote are a confusing mess. As noted, I'm a bidet novice, but I rarely encounter a device so confusing. In the end it works, but it could be much much better. The heated set takes no explanation, and it's wonderful. The somewhat bulky nature of the device and the reduced seat space is a bit of a bummer.

In regards for the actual bidet stuff, well ymmv. It's hard to describe. The water temp is good (and adjustable), and it doesn't spray anywhere I didn't expect (and it's adjustable)."
I was really excited to try this American standard bidet. I grew up in Germany and we had bidets in all of our houses. I was surprised when I came to America that they were not bidets in the bathroom here. At the time I pick this up I had two toilets with standard seats or round seats. Shortly after though I had to replace a toilet and I figured I would get the elongated to use this as a lid/seat. I had the toilet installed professionally and had two plumbers install it. They attempted to install this as a seat to the toilet however it did not fit properly. They try to make many modifications but it did not work out. I’m upset because I had an Elongated toilet but I was not able to use this toilet seat. American Standard does make the best products in my opinion but for some reason this one just did not fit my toilet.
"Took me a long time to actually install this. Because the main issue is that you need an electrical outlet. So we had to hire an electrician to install an outlet in our toilet room in the master bathroom. It worked well because the room has walls on both sides of the toilet, it is easy to install the remote control on those walls so you can easily see what buttons to push. The bidet is quite nice. Although, it doesn't quite spray the exact spots you may want from person to person, you can adjust your own position. It works well despite all the inconvenience of getting the outlet installed the bidet is great if overly expensive. Whether it is worth the price? I'm not sure. I have also have 2 other bidets installed in my house that don't require electricity that work just as well."
"I am somewhat new to the Bidet world, but this is easy to use. Installation is simple enough - but be aware that you need a plug nearby, which many people might not have. If you are looking for a quick way to convert to a bidet, this will work for you."
"This is installed in a hotel we are staying in right now, and at first I was very skeptical. But after trying it out, I have decided that I must have one from my own home too. The operation and use at first as a little hard to figure out, but once you figure out the sequence, it works great. So after dropping the boys off in the pool, what I do is use the clean function for several seconds as it washes away all the little bits of pieces that hang around afterwards… Then a quick switch over to the bidet function cleans further making your nether regions nice and clean… Then I follow up with the heated blow dry, drying everything out. It’s just like you’ve had a shower, without inconvenience of getting undressed and jumping in for a quick rinse… The cleaning function is like the tongue of God licking your anus. I can see some people abusing this toilet seat and never wanting to leave, as the water tickles away at your ‘taint, this could make people never want to get up off the toilet. This is a game changer, but I would recommend that no company install this in their work toilets as you will never get your workers to leave the bathroom. If you want a clean sparkling bunghole, that shines like a diamond in a goats ass, this is your toilet seat."
"We've had a very basic bidet for years (the type that connects to the tank and sprays cold water). Not ideal, but it did the job.

But this thing - this is pure luxury! Not only does it cut down on toilet paper usage, everything is much, much cleaner down there and has been proven to help prevent UTI's. The fact that it's warm water now is heavenly to us. We waited far too long to install it because we don't have an electric outlet near our toilet. When we realized we could just use an extension cord, it was game on. I keep the bathroom very clean so installing it was a snap - took about 10 minutes. I didn't think I'd care about a warm toilet seat (in fact, I usually hate them........ because there's usually only one way they're warm and I don't want to know my boss or some stranger in that way) but this is great - especially because our bathroom is always cold.

We have a toilet light guiding our way. We have the Mega Luxury Bum Cleaner with this toilet seat. We have the double blasting shower heads. Now all we need is heated floors and towel racks and I'll feel like I'm at a mini spa everytime nature texts (she texts now, no more calling)."
The product is well made and of good quality.
"I’ve never had a bidet seat before getting this one. And, to be honest, I wasn’t sure if I even wanted one. But, now that I’ve had this one for a few months, I can say that I’m pretty pleased with it overall.

Installing this bidet seat is pretty straightforward and easy, and will not be a problem for anyone UNLESS you don’t have an electrical outlet, or a way to get an electrical outlet or extension cord plug very near your toilet. In my case, I have an electrical outlet right behind my toilet in the adjoining room (my office). So, I simply ran an electrical cord out the back of that outlet box through the wall to the new toilet seat. It was a perfect fix.

The bidet seat itself works well, and so far we’ve had no issues with it. The warmed seat and water feels nice (especially in winter), and the nozzles can be moved around with the remote control to provide good cleaning coverage. If you’re looking for a bidet seat, I think, like me, you’ll be pleased with this one. It’s a well-made, well-designed seat. And given that many bidet seats are $500 to $1000, it’s reasonably priced, too.

If you have any questions about this bidet seat, please feel free to ask, and I'll try my best to answer. I hope you found this review helpful."
This is a great bidet. I have installed three bidets over the past few years and this one was very simple. What I really like about this one is that the bidet doesn't stick out on one side or the other like most bidets do which can cause issues with the bidet fitting next to a sink or the tub. Since the mechanism is in the back you don't need to worry about the seat fitting. You also need to power this seat up which I didn't have with the other three bidet's. I have to plug it in by the bathroom sink so it isn't the best setup in my bathroom but it works. I am very happy with this bidet and how much area you can clean. Most bidets spray water and you need to move your body around to hit certain areas....not with this seat. You can clean your entire area without moving around. I highly recommend this seat. It is comfortable and is the best bidet I have ever used.
"This toilet seat is designed to convert your standard toilet into having the advantages of a Bidet too. When I travel over seas, mostly in Japan and Europe I always find it refreshing to use a Bidet, when I saw this American Standard Bidet I figured I'd give it a try. The Heated seat is a nice feature you'll love on cold winter days. First you'll need an AC power outlet to plug it in. Next you'll need to add the needed plumbing thats included, it taps off the water inlet for the toilet. I was a little disappointed with quality of the hardware but its working ok just wish they used braided hose as its always under water pressure. The features this Bidet has are great, you use a control pad to activate each option. Even the seat has a heat feature. The whole Family is cleaner and happy with this great addition to our home. Saves toilet paper too !"
"I have never been disappointed with American Standard products. They make great toilets and their bidets exceeded my expectations. With most bidats you have to move around to clean the bum properly but the range of the spray on this one cleanses properly without needing to move. The remote has a lot of different features, the best being the heating options for the toilet seat. It makes cold mornings a lot more enjoyable when you are doing business in the morning. I have no complaints about this product and would recommend, even if you don’t have much room in between the sink and toilet it fits just like a regular seat because the mechanical pieces are at the rear of the seat. This item works exactly as described and I will continue to buy this brand, their products always work the best."
"This ""American Standard Advanced Clean Bidet"" gets 5 stars for a variety of reasons:
1. If you have the correct tools, i.e. open end wrench and Phillips head screwdriver, installation is quite easy.
2. Provided installation instructions are, at least, adequate.
3. And all required parts are provided.
Assuming you have the correct type bowl. Which I installed new. And you have a power outlet within close proximity, which I have, then the operation of nozzle adjustment(s), warm water and seat, are very easy with the provided remote. Remote placement is a matter of preference.
A side note: when I was checking for the correct operation I used my arm to simulate weight applied to the seat and received a surprise splash of water. Photos accompany this review.
All controls 'seem' to work as intended and whether it's a loved appliance is up in the air for the moment."
"We've been using this amazing invention for a couple of months now. It has changed everything. We were complete newbies to this form of personal cleansing and so there was a slight learning curve but once you get the hang of it you will never want to use t.p. again. It installed easily on our elongated toilet and we were fortunate to have the electrical outlet we needed close by. Excuse the bluntness but we find ourselves ""holding it"" until we get home just to use this luxury device. Even the softest tissue seems so barbaric now. We've had no issues and we sing the praise of our new cleaning seat to all our friends."
"I've installed 3 bidets of different brands, this one was the easiest. My only problem was there was no wall plug in the bathroom so I had to buy a long extension cord to plug this in. Other than that, the unit was installed in less than 10 minutes. All the accessories included. The plumbing hook up was easy too. The fan was good power and the seat warms up very fast during cold winter nights. The large remote control display was nice. My only concern is if the cleaning extension rod will clean well by itself. That's where most non-sanitary issues come from. I wonder why no brand bother to include a UV disinfection port that activates only when the seat cover is down. Anyway, common sense but doesn't go far enough."
"NOTE: You need an outlet to plug this into.
We love this toilet seat. After using it, you feel clean and confident. Installation, after the outlet was installed, and the waterline was connected, was nearly as easy to install as a normal toilet seat. Operation is easy too. The remote allows you to do everything you need. My favorite feature though is that the in the middle of the night, when the seat is usually at it's coldest, this one is not. This is nearly the perfect toilet seat."
This isn't a bidet in the traditional sense but is every bit as useful. This also isn't as expensive as a complete bidet but works just fine on a regular toilet. We got one professionally installed and it works amazingly well. Would recommend it all the way and remember to get it professionally installed.
"I would highly recommend this bidet seat. The heated seat is a real game changer, especially in the colder months. It's so nice when it's cold outside and you can come into a warm seat. This feature alone makes it worth the purchase. I've been thoroughly satisfied with it!"
"We are extremely pleased with the bidet seat. It is very comfortable and easy to operate and clean. When purchasing a bidet seat it is worth the money to get one that delivers heated water and has a heated seat. The seat is a little bit difficult to install, just need to read the directions carefully and be patient."
"It only worked for a year. The seat never fit tight so it never aligned correctly. The position setttings did not adjust to where they were neeeded, had to position my body. Total waste of money. I should have returned it and just used a peri bottle."
"With bidets becoming so popular in the United States, it makes sense for American Standard to offer a selection for sale at common hardware stores. The Japanese brand that popularized them, Toto, has sunk in quality with their recent offerings and this AC 2.0 model could be a better buy.

Two of my favorite features in bidets are the heated seats and deodorizing fans, which are not possible on the cheaper unpowered models. The AC 2.0 has both and they work perfectly. The seat temperature can be adjusted to be just right, making me wish all my seats had this function. The fan turns on when in use and for a while after, with nearly silent operation. Other functions I look for are a misting of the bowl prior to each use to prevent fecal matter from sticking and a drying fan. Unfortunately, the AC 2.0 does not have either.

The self-cleaning wands works reliably and the control panel buttons are big and easy to use. The labels are confusing, with the ""bidet"" being for feminine hygiene. I got a spray in the balls when I pressed that one. The ""cleansing"" button is for anal use and can be adjusted a bit to hit the right spot, but the main adjustment comes from sitting position. The massage function is pretty lame and doesn't do much. The hot water tank is very small and the water becomes cold quickly. I can't fault the model too much for this, because in-line heaters for unlimited hot water are never available in this price range. An option would be running a hot water line to the bidet, but this would lead to a lot of energy loss due to hot water sitting in the lines, mostly unused for the bidet. For those few who have a small water heater near the toilet, such as under the sink, that would be a good option. Otherwise, just enjoy the warm water while it lasts.

In terms of water stream pressure, it seems largely dependent on your water pressure. My water pressure is unfortunately a little low.

Like many bidet seats, this one has a chunky rounded plastic design that would look at home in a hospital. Build quality is great, though, with a slow close hinges and thick rubber pads to keep things quiet. Installation was quick and painless.

There are so many options for bidet seats that the one I would choose would vary from day to day as prices change. What I can say is that this one is built well and does the job. It holds its own against other options in this price range."
"Works great, love the heated seat for winter!"
"First, I'd like to say that this bidet seat is a great addition to my bathroom. The easy cleaning feature is a total game changer. The side panel control is super user-friendly and makes usage a breeze. Needless to say, I'm highly satisfied with this purchase!"
It is NOT for handicapped. No dryer and although one answer said the remote COULD be hand held - it cannot. Although I weigh 160 pounds I feel sure I’m not THE heaviest person- the seat is so small that the water doesn’t reach my feminine area. Also water is warm for about 5 seconds 😢
"Actually this American Standard Advanced Clean SpaLet Bidet Seat works great.

Let me preface the following by saying that I have been doing plumbing of all kinds for a very long time and have installed lots of toilets, seats, faucets, fixtures, water heaters, showers and about everything else to do with plumbing.

One problem is and what seriously concerns me is the adapter hose. Normally toilet flush valves are connected from the water valve to the flush valve with a braided hose that has a conical rubber washer and a plastic nut that only needs to be hand tightened to get a leak free connection. This American Standard Bidet Seat has metal connector that uses a flat rubber washer. I have not seen toilet flush valve connections using flat rubber washers for a very long time. That means the bottom of threaded part of the flush valve has to be essentially defect free and flat or you are going to have to really tighten that metal nut on plastic threads. With the current conical rubber washer it seals to the flush valve's hole and is a lot more forgiving. I had to repeatedly tighten the adapter's flush valve nut as even moderately tight it leaked. I started to get worried that I was going to strip the plastic threads and end up with a lot of water on the floor before I could shut the water valve off. I was finally able to get the leak to stop but feel that I had to overtighten the metal nut on the plastic flush valve's threads. The toilet is also an American Standard and so is the flush valve. In looking on American Standard's website, all the hoses shown for their bidet seats have a plastic tee, not metal.

Next problem was that the SpaLet Bidet Seat would not lock into place on the Mounting Plate. Note that this American Standard SpaLet Bidet Seat was being installed on an American Standard toilet! After taking it apart and reviewing the problem, I had to file down two inside corners of the mounting plate to allow the seat to lock into the mounting plate.

Another issue although minor is annoying. The initial water pressure is much higher than the continuing water pressure even though it is on the lowest setting. This may be a result of how the seat controls the water pressure.

Another issue that is annoying is that the warm water does not last very long. It says it has 0.88L but does not seem like that much is used before the water starts cooling.

This SpaLet Bidet Seat is not very attractive. It has an American Standard label on the top and another label on the side. It would look a lot better without either of those.

Another problem which I hope is only temporary is that there are no parts available nor even a parts list for this SpaLet Bidet Seat. I checked American Standard's website and no parts listed and parts manual. I guess if you have a problem, you throw it away and buy a new one?

It is remarkable that a company that claims 140 years of plumbing and 50 years of bidets goes through all the trouble to design and manufacture what could be an outstanding product but yet ignores the obvious. That the water connection should easily be leak free and not worrisome and that the seat should easily slide into and lock on the mounting plate.

I also installed a competitor's unit that is very similar but costs less and was actually easier to install. It has also more features and works much better overall. I would recommend shopping around and comparing similar units before considering purchasing this one."
"We got two different models of this seat and had to pay an electrician $465 (each) to install an outlet for the seat. Before you buy this you need to realize one thing... You basically need an outlet right behind the toilet to use it, and not just any outlet. It has to be some kind of grounded outlet due to being by water and moisture and humidity and you really have to hire a licensed and experienced electrician to do it for safety reasons. It cost me $465 for each seat to have it done. How much it costs you will vary depending on who does it, where you live and what rates are in your area, what your existing wiring looks like, etc. So you may pay less but you may pay more. You need to get estimates if budget is an issue.

Now for the seat itself. It works great. Early mornings have been colder than usual and I may be a priss but I really don’t like putting my bare derrière on a freezing cold seat first thing in the morning.

I always had a bidet growing up and one in my homes so this feature isn’t uncommon for me. This one works and does the job. It works well just make sure you clean the controls regularly (I use Clorox wipes) to keep germs at bay.

The slow close lid has made my life less stressful. Honestly I know it sounds nuts but it has. My husband and kids always just used to drop the toilet seat instead of setting it down and it would bang so loud I would swear the bowl would crack at some point. The slow close seat prevents that. No banging. No worrying about the bowl cracking at some point. Peace and quiet.

Overall I have to say this is a great seat that works well and gets the job done. Just realize that if you don’t have the outlet for it you’re going to need to have that installed so if budget is an issue add that figure into the cost. If you’ve never had a bidet before it’s one of those things you don’t realize you’ve been neeing until you have one. Definitely recommend this."
"Once installed , this bidet is a nice bathroom upgrade. The manual, while clearly written was daunting in size. I used the services of both an electrician and a plumber to get it installed. Although there was an outlet in the right place it had to be upgraded to a GFCI which essentially protects you against shock. No great big surprise I guess. Water and electricity can be a problematic match. As I would rather be safe than sorry I opted not to install myself.

Once installed, this is a nice upgrade. The heated seat is terrific especially when it is chilly. The warm water is freshening and the experience is pleasant. The controls are simple to use especially once your become familiar with them. (A remote would be easier.) The cleaning mechanism works efficiently and effectively which was an aspect of concern for me The slow close cover is a plus..

If you are looking for a better than basic bidet, this is worth consideration. So far it has performed without issue and is probably more environmentally friendly. Be prepared for the outlet upgrade though."
"I was hoping to just be able to install this in our bathroom and go (no pun intended.) Did not think about the electrical, and nobody wants even a short extension cord in the bathroom. I have an outlet on the wall above the toilet so temporarily have it connected there. We're doing a bathroom remodel in the near future so will put a GFCI outlet in next to the toilet then.

Functionality is straightforward - our favorite feature is actually the seat warmer. The bathroom tends to be cool in the winter and it really is nice to have a warm seat. It's also modern looking ans sleek.

Because of the electrical requirements, it's not something most people can just install - it needs some pre-planning and a GFCI outlet. I get the feeling that most people will do what we did and install it permanently as part of a remodel. It has all the convenience of a bidet (well, except for the bowl), plus the heated seat and self cleaning - and takes up almost no additional room."
"If you can catch this on sale it is the best bidet for the buck. The features are great, my family loves the warm water and seat during the winter. The material is very easy to keep clean and sturdy. I love that you can program the buttons to pulse or move back and forth with the push of a button. This works to keep you fresh and clean. I'm not to fond of the air dryer as it does take a little longer than if you just take a couple of squares to dry off. This cut our tp consumption use significantly. I originally bought this during the great tp shortage of 2020-2021 and it helped a lot. This makes you feel almost as clean as if you just got out of the shower."
"I've never owned or even used a bidet before so I was a bit nervous when I first tried. I may have been a little tense. But the seat is warm, the water is warm and it hits the right spot without fail. Easy to install. If you don't have an electrical outlet close enough to the bidet you will need to add one. Currently mine is plugged into the bathroom outlet which is GFCI protected. You really need to make sure the outlet is protected (because water and electricity do not play nice together). I'm not going to leave it that way, so a small extension cord that gets it to work temporarily.
Register your product and enjoy the good life!"
"This is our second one as we liked the first one so well we bought this for our winter condo
This one has the remote that is much easier to use and stays cleaner as it is mounted on the wall in easy reach. I think bio bidet is the best in this line of products. No issues with this one or the one we have had for a few years."
"This review is based on USA requirements for electrical and plumbing.

1. In the USA it is not common to have an electrical outlet in close proximity to the toilet. In this case you are required to have a 15 AMP GFCI outlet available and it has to be close enough to use the provided power cord as an extension cord cannot be used. The BB-1000 has its power cord fed from the right rear of the item as you are facing the toilet. The power cord is 3' in length. Keep that in mind as you determine where your outlet is to be installed. Keep in mind that the area could be wet or humid depending on how your toilet room is arranged/built. You do not want the GFCI outlet anywhere near where it could be splashed or it will trip immediately. Proper layout will avoid future aggravation.

2. The water feed on the unit itself is made of plastic (possibly nylon) The tee valve provided has metal threads and you must take care to be sure you do not cross thread this as you do the installation. If it does not thread immediately without resistance stop and take a very close look under good lighting to make sure you have those threads properly positioned. Use a properly sized crescent wrench to tighten the fittings and do not overtighten. This is a work process that requires care. It is not a strength contest.

3. The BB-1000 does not attach to the toilet in the same manner a conventional toilet seat does. It slides into a base plate that you are to attach to the toilet using provided bolts. The base plate connects in the same manner you would do if you were installing a conventional seat. When you have the base plate properly mounted you can then slide the BB-1000 into the base plate until you hear a click. The BB-1000 has a Tab on the right side bottom and if/when you need to remove the seat for servicing simply push in that tab and slide the BB-1000 out of the attachment point. This is good feature, although I cannot comment how long any of this plastic will hold up, so a service life is unknown at present.

4. The Remote Control Panel for the BB-1000 operates on its own frequency like a garage door operator does. Unfortunately the range of the signal (with brand new lithium batteries) is less than two feet, so where you mount the panel is best determined by that range. The 'brain' of the BB-1000 is located on the bottom left as you stand facing the Toilet. After experimenting with numerous locations we found the best performance was to the left of the BB-1000 and within 20"" maximum. If you are unable to mount the panel within that dimension, we suggest that you hold the panel as close to the previously described 'brain' as possible and make your selections. This is an area that they should improve upon.

5. The Owners Manual they provided is written in what we call Chinglish, although it is an improvement upon what we have seen in other items made in China, However the Images showing the various parts are all extremely small and lack clarity or detail. This is compounded by the cheap, porous paper they used that allowed the ink to bleed. That wouldn't have been noticed if the images had been large enough to show details. But in order to be sure we were setting this up correctly we used an iPhone 14 camera to zoom in and magnify the details we wanted to see, so as to better understand the manufacturer's intent. It was then that we realized the issues with print quality.

6. We find that the lid itself is extremely flimsy and they warn you in several locations of the manual that you must not sit or stand on the lid as it is not designed to bear any loads. Take them seriously, for your own safety.

7. The manual gives numerous warnings about the use of cleaning agents and solvents, as they will damage the plastic. Keeping in mind that our review is based on USA customs and practices, and we believe that the standard Lysol or Clorox type spray bathroom cleaners will work fine. Obviously you will wipe the surfaces dry and not leave a residue or your own skin might be unhappy. We shouldn't have to explain much more beyond that. You'll get the idea.

We are pleased that the BB-1000 when properly installed and set up works as promised. For those people with limited mobility, impaired reach, or special needs the BB-1000 will provide a very real improvement in quality of life.

We know this was a little bit wordy, but perhaps the details provided will enable you to accomplish a quick and easy installation."
"Purchased this Bidet in November and have used it daily, and am very happy with the product. The unit seems to be will built and was very easy to install. The remote control pad works flawlessly and makes use very easy. I plan to purchase another one for my other bathroom when I finish my remodel. I will purchase this one."
I love bio bidet products. They made to last. I bought more to give to my friends. No more looking at your poop every time you wipe. Love the vortex feature. Good temperature for the seat and water. It really cleans well. Highly highly recommend. Better than Toto in my opinion.
"Bought 2 of these and 1 had a defective nozzle. Ok that will happen so no big deal. I call the company and I get Kurtis who tells me ship back the unit and they will send a replacement. I tell Kurtis that I have just installed all the plumbing and hardware on the unit so could he send the new one so I don't have to uninstall everything and then reinstall it again. He says that's a much better idea we'll do that. I have had numerous companies tell me everything must be uninstalled and reinstalled so normally I do not get their replacement products then. Not this company, they stand behind their product. Replacement arrived in days not weeks. Since I installed everything already it was an easy disconnect/reconnect instead of full uninstall and reinstall. This one worked perfectly as did the other one I bought. Kurtis could not have been faster, more courteous, more competent or any more helpful. He made everything so easy and he was amazing. The bidets are incredible, especially when you consider how reasonable the price is compared to others. They work very well, do exactly what they are supposed to do and are very convenient. We all could not be any happier with the performance of the product and of course with the customer service and how they not only stand behind their product but make it as easy as possible if there are any issues. We highly recommend this bidet!"
"I bought this unit in late 2018 - single user household - thing is used once a day, maybe twice, being generous, and has been kept immaculately clean. It was great, and worked well.

Around 2 years, 4 months into its life, suddenly it started failing with the same types of failures others have reported - all of which pointed to an issue with the CPU / control board in the thing going out. It started with the nozzle no longer retracting, so you'd get sprayed with a super powerful self-cleaning blast when it was supposed to be retracted. Then, it moved to being sporadic in retracting at all, or extending out to the set position. For a while, I could unplug it, wait 20 seconds, plug it back in, and it would reset and fix itself.

After about a month of that, it moved on to resets not working either, and the problems progressed. The nozzle would come out fully instead of retracting after unplugging and replugging it, and it would start to spray water all over the bathroom, even without anyone on it. The factory reset shortcut no longer worked. I put some saran wrap on the toilet and put a hand on the seated person sensor so I could see what it was doing when I used the remote, and it was all over the place - pushing the button to move the nozzle forward would move it backwards, or not at all. Pushing the backwards button would move it forwards. Pushing the button to pulse the water in massage mode would make it move back and forth, as if the Move button was pushed, and pushing the Move button would do nothing at all.

Clearly, this isn't just a case of a bad sensor as to the position of the head, but the electronics inside going completely out of their mind after a period of time, which points to a factory defect.

I contacted Bio Bidet warranty service about this, and was told I'd need to send in the seat (at my own cost - getting a box and proper packing materials for something this size, plus shipping it ground, is going to cost almost $30), plus 50% of the price of the bidet (so $250), plus potentially another $35 ""disinfection"" fee, at their discretion.

So, 28 months of use on a bidet this expensive, and the manufacturer requires close to $300 to repair what is clearly a problem in the design of the product. Based on other reviews here having the same problem, it doesn't appear there's been any redesign that will prevent this problem from coming back in another 2 years.

Ask yourself this before buying or looking elsewhere: is $18 / mo for the first 28 months + $11 / mo for the next 2 years (in-warranty repair cost after it breaks in 2 years), after which you're completely out of warranty and need to repeat the cycle with a new unit something you really want to spend on a bidet?

Look at competitors that stand behind their product instead."
"We have a one piece Kohler toilet, no hot water inlet and a low plug a few feet away. I have been looking for the right bidet for several years without success. Many of them do not fit one piece toilets and having a cold stream hitting my bum was not something I wanted.
Finally figured out to google all my needs for a bidet, and this one popped up. Brilliant! and Amazon was having a black friday sale - SCORE!!!! I was worried something used or defective would show up, but it was sealed up tight in its box and looked never touched by human hands.
The installation took awhile, the instructions weren't clear on my particular model and could have been better. It's also VERY tricky to install the t-valve. Honestly, it takes two people so you don't screw up your flush valve inside the tank.
The first time I tried it out, it was unplugged and yes, the water shot me in the face. Don't be like me! Don't turn the knob until you're good and plugged in. Also, the beeping was so annoying! I actually called biobidet to ask how to turn it off - ""to turn off the beeping on the BB500 and BB550, hold the seat temp button on the right side of the seat, for 2 seconds.""
I also purchased an extension cord for the plug, and anchors so its not flopping around the bathroom. Still trying to find an adhesive that works in bathroom humidity but that's a separate thing.
https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B075KNTG17/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&th=1

Anyway, my husband and I literally LOVE this thing! The seat is toasty warm, the water is nicely heated, sprays in just the right spots and no more stumbling to the toilet in the dark. Its like a little beacon in the middle to the night.
I've been bidet-ing so much since we've gotten it, and good grief, I have NEVER felt so clean. My bum is also super happy about being treated so nicely.
I'm not sure how long this thing will last, its got alot of gadgets, bells and whistles so its time is probably limited, so I cannot report of longevity. Hopefully it will last at least until the next black friday."
"This unit works well - it isn't as sophisticated in terms of controls as some more expensive models, but it does deliver sufficiently adjustable quantities of hot water and pressure, so the job gets done. The on-seat controls are a little wonky, in that they're located on either side of the seat (flow control on the right, temp control on the left) so you kind of have to grope around for them, compared to units with remote controls or more accessible on-seat controls. There are also fewer options than on more expensive models, but for the price, this is a very good bidet and a good value.

One installation note: the instructions ask that you push two rubber stoppers through the toilet seat mounting holes on your toilet. This is only, apparently (confirmed by Bio's tech support) for one-piece toilets, which most people installing this unit likely don't have. There's no warning on this in the included instructions. If you have a two-piece (tank and seat separate) toilet, then omit the rubber stoppers and just use the metal screws on top of the rectangular washers and the spinning nuts to secure those screws on the underside."
"If you haven't used bidets, you should give it a try. Takes a little getting used to but once you do, you are simply cleaner and healthier. This helps:
1) the dreaded unclean release...this thing cleans more than just the outside
2) cleans rectum of any hemorrhoid inducing irritants (like popcorn husks, etc) that aren't completely digested
3) enables elders with limited reach/mobility to keep THEMSELVES clean, without suffering the indignity of getting help
4) Cut TP use to 1/3 of past! TP becomes a drying and verification wipe.

Once you use this for a month, you will never want the normal approach again. For manly men, not everything from Europe is bad. This isn't a feminine/masculine thing. You don't develop a ""relationship"" with your device, although the cleaning sensation is not unpleasant. Fear not! Dive in, and buy this thing because ""water does it better."""
"Love the heated seat, warm water adjustments, and different pressure of water flow. It's also not too bulky like some other models. The only thing I wished was different is that the light would only come on when you approach the toilet. I have seen other models do this and I like that feature better. For the $ this is a great product."
"It works as it is intended to work. It is the subject of many interesting and amusing conversations. Have you priced toilet tissue lately? A big pack costs as much as a tank of gas. The bidet seat cut our toilet tissue use significantly. She says it has an objectionable odor no matter how frequently she cleans it. The deodorizer cartridge doesn’t appear to be the cause of the smell. It is not a lack of cleaning. Maybe the heating element or some other component smells bad. I can’t figure it out and I can’t smell it, but I can’t smell anything. She says she would try another brand because of the smell. It is a great concept but I don’t know how long she will put up with the smell…"
"I was apprehensive about springing for a bidet seat instead of a bidet attachment, which we had in our apartment. This was a complicated install and I had to have electricians come and install an outlet in the toilet room in our master bath, but boy am I glad we did. I was worried a warm seat would make me feel like someone just pooped before me, but it’s an absolute game changer. The fact that it moves to clean your butt and then dries it is a huge plus. You won’t regret this purchase. Removed 1 start because the construction feels a bit flimsy compared to traditional toilet seats and the lid is just plastic."
"My sister, the recipient, reported that she highly recommends this and suggested we get one for ourselves. She did say it took a little getting used to but she is very happy with it. She did not have any complaints and that is saying a lot.

It was installed by maintenance staff at her apartment so I can't review that detail."
"To see warmer is awesome, especially in the colder months.
Fajita dry is nice, but it doesn't do the full job. You still need a little bit of TP.
The only complaint is that sometimes the button presses don't register and you have to hit the button a few times to turn it on, or off, but otherwise a super solid purchase.
Very easy to install as well"
"I love the heated settings and the night light, however it doesn’t fit our slightly curved tank. Also, the water pressure it a little lacking, even on the turbo setting."
"This product's sleek design sets it apart, avoiding the bulky appearance of other options. It seamlessly integrates with my existing toilet, offering precise seat adjustments. The straightforward controller simplifies operation with temperature, nozzle, and lighting controls. The night lighting is a standout feature, eliminating the need for additional lights during midnight use. Overall, a modern, cost-effective bidet that I highly recommend."
Didn't realize the 1000 model would run out of warm water before the end of the cleaning cycle is done. Bought the 2000 for my mother's bathroom and it has unlimited warm water. Disappointed I didn't know this before purchasing. Only discovered this after researching on line to see if something was wrong with the device. The cost is a bit more but may be worth it for the comfort.
I purchased this out of curiosity. I was so glad I did. It took a very short time to get use to it. It does a great job.
"The bidet seat functions well. The remote buttons don't work well. Sometimes I have to punch a button a few times. This includes the STOP, FRONT and DRY button. One time the stop button didn't work at all and I had to get off the seat to get it to stop."
"Easy to install, really looks nice. My favorite feature is the heated seat.
like the simplicity with no remote. highly recommend."
"Great item, simple to install."
"Easy install, took just over an half hour. Was a Christmas gift for the wife. She was using a entry level bidet and loves it. When she saw this one she said how much did this cost. After using it and having warm water, heated seat and air dryer she said, “worth every penny”."
"Hubby had spinal fusion surgery and is not to bend forward. So we bought this bidet with remote control. I did need to purchase a new toilet as the seat holes on old toilet were too narrow. Which worked out for him to have a taller toilet. Anyway, bidet was easy to install and get set up. I ran an extension cord around the sink over to the bidet. Since he doesn’t read instructions, he did manage to figure out remote after a few uses and all is well in his underworld now. Also, now that it’s winter he likes the seat warmer feature."
"I love this. Easy to install, the only tool needed was a screwdriver to take the old seat off. I love that it boosted the height of the old toilet."
"I bought this after returning the Toto C5 which is a more elegant deign but sadly ineffective at its primary function. The BB 1000 is an older, less sophisticated design with an extremely clunky remote. That being said, the BB 1000 has a saving grace, IT WORKS for its primary function and cleans effectively. If Bio Bidet would upgrade the technology of the remote, this would be a great choice."
"3 bath home with a BB-1000 in each of them. This is the BEST way to clean your bottom. Have been using them for years, only wish I could take it on vacation with me. This unit uses a water pump that has a water pressure that is more than adequate. My only complaint is ""our"" hard water, that is very corrosive, fails in the water heater tank and pop's a ground fault breaker. This happens after 3-4 years of use. Our electric water heater does the same only takes 6-7 years. This is a problem caused by our water and not the BB-1000."
Great item and A+ seller.
It keeps my bum clean.
"I’m pretty much a no-frills sort of person, but take it from me, once a bidet is experienced, it becomes a necessity. A toilet seat costing several hundred dollars seems like a big luxury compared to a $40 replacement seat, but I encourage everyone to spend the money to get a bidet because once you try one, you realize it's a necessity, not a luxury. (This also happened with the people who moved into my old house with another bidet when I moved out--he's a construction guy who said he’d never once though of having such “frills” but, after three months using a heated-seat, slow-close lid, and water cleaning, he said he and his wife would never go back! I feel the same way.)

After moving from the home where I’d had a seat-bidet for two years to a home with only a conventional toilet seat, I immediately erupted with hemorrhoids (which I hadn’t had problems with since I installed the first seat.) The hemorrhoids stayed until I purchased this new Bio-bidet seat eight months later. After it was installed the hemorrhoids were gone in a less than a week. Accustomed to cleaning with water, I never felt clean without it during all those conventional-seat months, with all those shreds of paper left behind in the folds and the general feeling of not being clean.

The one thing I wished for when I had the lesser model was a dryer, but now that I see how the dryer works, I realize that the concept of a dryer is probably a luxury too great to be wished for. Let’s face it, even a hot-enough-to-burn hair dryer would NOT be able to dry water DROPLETS. What I learned through trial and error was that 3 or 4 pieces of toilet paper, laid on top of each other then folded in half is enough to pat the droplets, then the dryer can dry the dampness so there is no chaffing. No rubbing with toilet paper to get clean because you’re already clean.

The Bio-Bidet has more bells and whistles than my previous bidet seat, including jet and massage functions. For me, there is sufficient hot water for normal cleaning, though if you want some long massages or have a medical need, you might want to go to the continuous hot water model (if your electric can carry it). I’ve seen some people complain that the intensity of the water stream isn’t great, but I personally would’t want it any stronger. The water flow intensity in the Bio-Bidet is stronger than my old bidet.I also like the wall-mounted control panel.

I’ve read some complaints about the cleaning function for women not reaching far enough. Certainly I had this problem with my old bidet, but the Bio-Bidet’s water stream is stronger and I have found that just by leaning forward slightly, it does just fine. Possibly there is a danger of too great an extension making the extender more likely to malfunction. In any case, I experimented until I got the hang of it, so to speak.

I highly recommend a bidet but is a $500 bidet better than a $300 bidet? I think what you buy needs to depend on your budget. My sense is that this Bio-bidet model is a better quality than the $300 model I had (from a different company) but I’m sure that as greater numbers of us join our European friends in believing bidets are a necessity, the prices will come down. Let’s hope so, for it’s such a blessing to feel clean and not be “rubbed the wrong way” with painfully dry toilet paper. But I don't think you can go wrong with this one, though I have given it a ""4"" because the instructions say not to clean it with anything except water and to be careful not to get urine or feces on it or it will yellow and crack. This doesn't make sense to me. It's sort of like saying to avoid getting water on your washing machine. I don't like this aspect of it at all. Otherwise, it's really great."
"I live in an assisted living community, and recent medical issues have made using the toilet difficult.

Installing the Bio Bidet Bemis BB-1000W was a breeze. An adjustable wrench was all I needed. Once I finally was able to remove the facilities provided toilet seat (uncovered) I completed the installation within under 1/2 hour. Just follow the easy-to-read instructions, and wa-la, an instant bidet that easily allows me to use the toilet.

From the heated seat and water to the ease of understanding the operation of the remote, this should be considered by every senior.

With limited storage within my unit, this function-rich bioBidet provided the best bang for my buck decision in the last two years. Hell, my girlfriend even enjoyed the experience of using a bidet in our 80's.

Buy this as a Christmas gift (or ask for it) and this will be the enjoyable gift that keep giving EVERY DAY. This has turned a difficult experience into a reasonably pleasant funcation."
Best purchase ever. Cleans as it should. You feel so much better after using it. Well worth the money
Very easy to install. Basic but gets the job done. Not a bunch of buttons to figure out or a remote to worry about if it goes bad and you’re stuck with a useless bidet.
The only thing wrong is it took a few tries to figure out the remote works by infrared so you have be sure to point it at the side buttons to make sure it works.
"Its a shame they do not make a product that has the powerful vortex wash and the great remote control of the BB-1000 and the continuous hot water of the BB-2000. The BB-1000 (this product) has the power but warm water lasts about only 20 seconds . Which for me was a deal breaker. Whereas the top of the line BB-2000 has both tank and continuous heated water but it suffers from a tiny remote control that is hard to see and confusing to adjust. The vortex (enema) function of the BB-2000 does not really work.
Both units have an annoying soft close mechanism that causes the seat to fall back down instead of staying up. This happens mostly if you just flip it up quickly as I prefer to do when natures call is urgent. Never had this problem with my old CC-9500 That said I think I will keep the BB-2000 because I do not know of a better one. I was just very disappointed the manufacturer could not get the design right."
"This bidet was so simple to install. We did not have an outlet by the toilet, so we had to use an extension cord which is not bad. The water is hooked up using the water supply to the toilet and NOT the sink which is what I was looking for since our toilet is in a separate room away from the sink. The remote is hung on the wall with command strips. The water is hot (for long enough) to get you clean. The pressure of the water is good. Since this is my 1st bidet, I don't have anything to compare it to but I think that I get clean enough. There is a fan to dry you off which is warm. The best part is you can have a heated toilet seat in the middle of a cold night. This seat is definitely more affordable than the smart toilets that I really wanted. It might not look as elegant...but hey you use what you can afford."
This was super easy to install and works great! I was hesitant to purchase at first but now glad I did
Product performance is better than expected. Easy installation in about 10 minutes.
"UPDATE after a couple of months:
With regards to the main complaint below of lack of forward/backward range of motion for the spray, after a few weeks/months of use the whole family is now comfortably getting clean with these bidet seats. Still not giving it five stars because there should be the ability to have the range of motion work correctly without having to change the way you've sat on the toilet your entire life, but after an adjustment period we don't even think about it any more. Overall 4.5 stars, but Amazon doesn't let you give half-stars so sticking with 4 stars as there is room for improvement.

ORIGINAL REVIEW BELOW:
We purchased three of these seats, and unfortunately now wish that we had not. Our household has three members (dad, mom, daughter) and none of us can get the spray adjusted correctly.

For the mom and daughter, they cannot get the 'feminine' spray adjusted far enough forward. Note that we know how to use the remote to adjust the position of the spray, it simply will not adjust far enough forward.

Similarly, the dad cannot get the 'posterior' spray adjusted far enough backwards.

In all cases, we end up having to contort and lean into weird, uncomfortable, and unstable positions in order to achieve appropriate cleanliness.

That being said, there are a still a lot of good things about these seats, as follows:

- Installation: the installation is about as easy as you can make plumbing, but it does take some work, and be sure to track your washers, the washers they use don't have catch tabs on them and tend to fall out while trying to install.

- Heated seats: will be nice in the winter, we turned them off during the sweltering Texas summer. Temp has three adjustment levels (off, medium, hot).

- Water temperature and pressure adjustment: you can adjust both the temperature and pressure of the water being sprayed.

- Automatic air filter: as soon as you sit down their air filter kicks in, which helps to reduce, but not eliminated, related odors.

- Blow dryer: having the ability to have air blown to dry off your nethers is very nice, and the temperature of the air is also adjustable.

All in all, if it wasn't for the limited forwarded and backward spray adjustments I'd give these five stars, but their limited range of motion across multiple people, genders, ages, and body types makes it impossible for me to recommend at this price. My guess is that if you are a uniformly tiny/thin family then the limits of the spray will probably not be an issue, but if you're a robust, typical American family with multiple sizes and shapes you may hit the same issue that we did."
"I like the features suite of the bidet, especially the Vortex function. The pressure was noticeably strong at lower settings so mid or high pressure settings not necessary in my opinion. Very easy to install and comes with all necessary parts to connect to your commode.
Pretty quiet during operation.
Heated water- check.
Heated seat - check.
Heated dryer- check.
Deodorizer- check.
High pressure setting (Vortex)-aaand check.
Not a fan of the huge remote.
Also you practically have to aim it at the unit for it to receive commands at times.
I had to mount mine under the tp roll for it to pick up command inputs ( about 90% of the time) first try.
DO NOT sit on the closed lid under any circumstances! Not designed to sustain your grown self!
I think an LED light would have been a nice touch for those late night visitations!
Overall solid product!"
Who knew that giving a gift of a tush spraying toilet seat would be such a hit?! But let’s say this is a hit. With the heated seat and spray
So far we are very happy with it. It was easy to install and to use.
"First and foremost… this item is truly plug and play. Installation was easy and only took a few minutes. And the remote feature is a game changer. I’ve used plenty of Bidet’s before that had the controls on the side of the seat, well fuhgetaboutit - sometimes I couldn’t see well enough to push the right buttons to get the desired effect - resulting in a disaster. This was an investment - especially when you have other competing priorities, but, we made the right call on this one. We’re happy!"
"I previously had a different heated bidet with all sorts of buttons an options. The water pressure wasn't great and sometimes the controls failed and required disconnecting the power to reset.

This one has been great. Simple functions, simple controls, good water pressure. Lower profile than some others and fits oval toilet perfectly."
Lots of great features. More than I will use. Only issue is sometimes I have trouble getting the remote to work. I think you have to point it very accurately.
"This product was not trouble free, but Bio Bidet treated me well and the BB1000 is now working well.

The first new bidet I received didn't produce hot water, so initially it didn't get much use. I made a warranty claim, and after I jumped through a few hoops Bio Bidet sent me a different new one.

I still had a substantial problem, however: the Vortex function is the reason I bought this bidet, but it rarely functioned. It can only be activated via the remote, and pushing the remote button rarely did anything. I didn't relish making a second warranty claim for another new bidet, and tried everything I could think of to no avail. I could usually make it work if I tried long enough, but it commonly took 15-30 pushes of the button, often interspersed with pushes of the more ordinary buttons on the bidet itself.

A few days before the full warranty expired I made a second warranty claim. Bio Bidet promptly sent me a new remote, which seemed to work somewhat better, but didn't come close to curing the problem.

Finally, I discovered the fix: If the desired function doesn't work on the first try from the remote, push the ""stop"" button on the remote. After that, the vortex button usually works on the first try, though the remote's ""stop"" button won't stop it. Usually, only the ""stop"" button on the bidet itself will stop it. That's not a big deal."
"Was skeptical about getting one, didn’t know what to expect, but we love it! It makes a great difference after we go. The warm seat, the warm air, it’s a game changer! Highly recommended."
Ok I will admit to being spoiled because I have a Toto bidet seat at home. I mean it raises the lid and turns on a little night at night it’s so fancy. So when I ended up in FL for months I just could not deal without a bidet seat. I decided to go with a simpler seat since this one would only be used for a short time. It installed easily and is easy to use for sure. The remote can be a bit picky about where it has to be placed to work with the seat. Make sure it has line of sight and won’t be blocked by your body. The biggest issue is that the water heating function just isn’t up to par. Not that it won’t heat at all. However about halfway through a cycle it begins to lose its ability to heat well and it is stone cold by the end. At least it isn’t stone cold from the beginning because that is a rude awakening moment for sure. Thankfully it has a stop button so you don’t have to sit through the whole cycle if you don’t need to. Even knowing it’s faults I would probably still order it because I won’t be using it unless I am in FL.
Very noisy when used. The frequent stop and starting of water pressure creates a hammering noise that is transmitted through the floor.
"If you have never tried a bidet, you should. If you have ever owned one, you will always own one. Electric bidets are awesome.

This unit when new worked great and we could not be more pleased with its performance. Then after 2-3 years, you start getting problems. While there are various issues with this unit, by far the most common has to do with the nozzle extending and retracting. The motor that extends and retracts the nozzle has an unsealed metal case and sits very low in the back of the unit. Over time the constant exposure to water causes the motor the rust and the nozzle extending and retracting will become erratic. It will first start with a little grinding sound and eventually end up not working at all. While this is a very inexpensive part that is sold for around $5 in China, BioBidet refuses to sell replacement parts. They would rather it last until the warranty expires and then for the consumer to buy a new one or pay them to service it for a similar price to buying a new one. I also tried to buy the replacement from a distributor in China but they do not sell individual motors and instead focus on selling larger quantity orders to other businesses. So after a few years, your $300+ bidet becomes more plastic landfill waste because BioBidet does not want to help the consumer. While I would wholeheartedly recommend getting a bidet, I would not recommend this model or this brand."
"The manual that came with the seat was not correct. You can down load a correct manual from the website. The manual says the factory setting for the remote is set for one light on the water pressure at the bottom, mine was set for all the lights. Took me two days to figure this out. Other than that I like the Bidet"
"Update: the make of Bio Bidet agreed to send me anew remote control unit bc the one that came with the new seed didn’t work well. All I had to do was send my proof of purchase at Amazon. Amazon could not deal with sending me a new replacement remote control, and seemed completely flustered at my request. (I bought the new bidet seat to replace my old identical one that finally gave out after 8 years of decent service.) this is wonderful and I would give the product of five if it didn’t have some design cheapness that I wish they would change: the seat is in two parts, and it’s glued together and where the crevice is, it collects “soil” that I must take a toothbrush to. And the maker should include some rubber washers to make sure the seat tightens on so well that it doesn’t wiggle. Outside of those two issues, it’s a really superior per day in terms of the functions, including the enema function. (Don’t ask!)"
we have had several of these and recommend everyone have one. This being our third and the best after solving an issue. we ere going to return it but the manufacturer recommended a new remote and problem solved! Great sales and service and there isnt much more you can ask for. The remote is big and clear to use. The presure and much greater than the other two units and that was my compaint about the others we had. We thought it was our water pressure in the house but it was really the units that we had in the past. bay this
"I purchased this exact model 12 years ago. It functioned perfectly without problems the entire time! Last month it suddenly stopped working. Without hesitation I reordered.
I gave it 4 stars because as with the previous bb 1000 it still seems like the plastic could be stronger. On my first bb 1000 the seat developed a hairline crack and I hope the same thing does not happen again.
In conclusion if you get one you will not know how you lived your life without it just treat it gently to avoid damage and it should last years"
"The water pressure, especially on Vortex mode, can be very strong. It can penetrate and fill your colon with water, especially if you relax your sphincter. You feel really clean. If you don't need that much power, you can reduce it down.

The other features work well, including water temperature, seat warmer.

A couple minor issues are the remote and the splash back. The remote is large and slightly dated, but the main issue is I have to repeatedly press on the stop button multiple times to pause the water spray. The work around is to use the buttons that are already attached to the seat. There are only three button on the seat: stop, spray anus, and spray vagina...it doesn't have customizations like the remote does.

The Splash back will vary based on the situation. If you have a messy bowel movement and the spray power. The max water pressure from vortex mode will clean your anus, but it can also cause the fecal matter to splash all over the bowl or under the bidet/seat. So it can get messy. This drives my girlfriend crazy. So be wary of this if you are a neat freek.

I don't regret buying the unit, but it comes with some caveats. Overall, any bidet is a worthy addition to your hygiene regiment, and the biobidet 1000 is a standout when it comes to pressure and value."
"I bought this for my wife because when we were in Italy and the villa we stayed at had the same BioBidet 1000 seat and she said ""It changed her life"" I am not sure if she was joking or not but when she came home from work last week and saw it she just lit up with a big smile. The seat was vey easy to install and the remote is perfect for her to read with ease. She is already talking about getting another one for our hallway bathroom so quests can enjoy it and hopefully buy one also. We give this a BIG 5 star review for quality and ease of use."
"Easy to install,very comfortable"
"I got pretty much exactly what I thought I was getting - a life-changing experience. I absolutely love this thing. As others have said, the dryer is never going to get you fully dry. But it does work a bit. I find that two squares afterwards works great to dry things and check for cleanliness. Installation was a breeze. I have nothing negative to say."
"So far, so good. We wanted something to help my disabled dad keep clean. The first bidet we bought, kohler, worked well but took up a lot of seat room. This biobidet is working great so far and i don't have to worry that my dad wont be clean in between showers."
Every toilet in Japan has this feature and I decided I needed it for my home. Great to get clean every time I use it.
"Ever since we went to Italy a couple years ago, I've wanted a Bidet! This is an early Christmas present...and it's only Thanksgiving! I thought it quite civilized that European countries offer the bidet option. We travel economically, and they were installed in most of our bathrooms. So lovely! Heated seat? Yeah! Warm water? Absolutely! I am grateful!"
"I have a Cat Genie for my cat's litter box, and a friend of mine told me that I can't have my cat's in a fancy litter box, and just have a regular toilet seat. So I researched and found this to be one of the most recommended models. Just got it installed this evening, very easy install, very flexible adjustment so it fits just right on your toilet. It's summer, so I don't appreciate the warm seat as much right now, but I know in winter at 3am when nature calls it's going to be a godsend. It takes a few minutes to warm up the water, as I got a cold surprise when I tested it moments after plugging it in, I tried it again later and I told my cat ""This is the life, you and me, we've got it good!"" LOTS of configurable options, I'm sure I'll go through all of them and dial it in perfectly, but the out of the box settings are fantastic.

In Metaphor : The Eye of Sauron has been extinguished, and ""Middle Earth"" is safely protected. A warm breeze blows through the Shire, and all is well."
"I had never really used or heard of a bidet really for most of my life, about 6 years ago I was deleting spam on my account when I stumbled across an email from bidet king having a big sale. I was curious so I clicked on the link read the features and reviews and for about $50 I got a very basic bidet, no bells and whistles just a butt sprayer basically. I was hooked, couldn't do #2's without it! Loved how it made you feel very clean afterwards and couldn't believe it isn't the norm here in the USA.

So this past fall we moved and I decided to toss out that old beat up thing and eventually pick up a better model. Well the day has come and that day was yesterday. I hooked this badboy up to my toilet in about ten mins. Now mind you I'm no mechanical whiz, I'm not a handy man and heck I'm 35 and I've only had my own tool set for a couple years and bought my first powered drill last year. Regardless it was very easy to install. When it was all said and done there was a tiny leak coming from the hose that connects to the toilet tank. It was about one drop every few mins or so. I put a bowl under it and figured the next day I'd get some plumbers tape and re-attach the line, but when I woke up the leak seemed to stop so maybe it just needed to settle. Anyways back to the topic on hand.....

THIS THING IS AWESOME!!!! My wife is still scared of bidets but she justified my purchase as long as I got one with a heated seat, so she's really happy with that. My 4 year old son loves the heated seat as well. I must have an average butt because I didn't need to adjust the sprayer or anything. Cleans very well, love the water tank. I didn't put a line filter on my unit because we have a big filter on the main water line coming into our house so all our water is filtered for debris and stuff (we're in Michigan we don't want that lead :P) With my old bidet I'd still end up having to wipe at least twice to dry my butt, with the blow dryer I only do a half wipe just to make sure its all good down there, but honesty this thing cleans very well and gets you good and dry afterwards. Hopefully I'll wear my wife down to where she'll finally try it out and I can add to my review about the female parts. All in all very happy with this purchase and I hope it lasts a long time. I haven't tried the other features of this yet, haven't done a massage or an enema on it. Maybe later on...."
"If you've ever wondered what it would be like to take your backside to the car wash, wonder no more!

The only thing this doesn't do is place an air freshener, uh, somewhere.

I installed this on my Toto CST744S-11 Drake Elongated toilet. It fits nicely, like it was made for it.

The good:

It has a heated seat, which is real nice in the winter time. You'll no longer feel like doing a jumping jack when making a late night visit to the pot and encounter a frozen seat.

There is a little, quiet fan that sucks the air from the bowl and runs it through a filter. Say goodbye to courtesy flushes and HAZMAT breathing gear.

The Posterior wash provides a spray of warm water that takes care of the Klingons and leaves you with a tidy rear. This, in turn, leaves you with tidy underwear.

The Feminine wash, well, I'm a guy, so I can't comment...same goes with the ""Massage"" function.

The Vortex? It works, but when you push that button, you better mean it!

The heated air dry function works well. It won't save you money in the short term, since it uses electricity (about 200 watts I believe), but if you have a septic tank like I do, it will reduce pumping out the tank.

The wireless remote is awesome! Not only can you place it just about anywhere (see below) but it can provide great amusement when you have unwitting guests over.

When you close the lid, it gently lowers itself down.

Finally, for easy cleaning, the whole thing comes off with just a pull of the lever, and as a guy, I'm all about easy cleaning.

The not good:

If you weigh more than, say, 250lbs, it will not hold up well.

The wireless remote does not work well if your body is between the bidet and the remote. You'll need to put it off to the side.

The internal hot water tank is unimpressive, size wise. If you use the water functions repeatedly, you'll run out of warm water...not fun in the winter. There are two solutions to this:

1) Wait a few minutes for the water to heat up, or,

2) Purchase a Biffy Bidet Bun Warmer or other water heater type thingy to preheat the water.

This wasn't an issue when I lived in Los Angeles, but now that I'm in the desert, that water gets COLD.

The conclusion:

Bidets are finally making inroads in the United States, and it's high time, too. Some folks think the whole concept is gross, however, if some thought is given to this, bidets are a lot less gross than the alternative.

I've used Bio Bidet products for years, and I have been satisfied by their workmanship and service. My previous bidet, eh, pooped out, and they repaired it and sent it back in less than two weeks.

HIGHLY RECOMMEND!"
"Easy to install. Works as advertised. Very pleased with product. Had it for a little over two months now and all is good. If it's durable and lasts, it will be a great buy."
"I took a chance on this archaic but lauded bidet simply due to the fact that it has the highest water pressure on the market. Yes even today though this was engineered in 2004. It's a shame honestly especially at this price. I owned a BB U770 that was brought to the market in 2019 and had more bells and whistles. I didn't like it either however. Bio bidet in general has let me down, now to the tune of $800 plus dollars. This particular model looks every bit its almost 20 years of old technology. It performs even worse. The remote control is easily the size of an Ipad and just ridiculous. Using said remote is hit or miss. I often have to hit the wash button multiple times before it initiates and once in a while it does so upon the first touch. IDK what's up with that. The Lag time in which the bidet actually begins a wash cycle is pretty ridiculous also. Too bad this thing doesn't have a spare tank as it could surely be heated by the time the first wash begins. On the topic of heated water um well there is VERY little to be had. It lasts no more than 10 to 15 seconds of the wash cycle. Major drag. I don't use the heated seat as I typically wear clothing and the flimsy plastic seat is no match for the body heat I sit upon it with. There is no nightlight. This is a superfluous feature imo opinion but for this price it'd be nice if bio bidet acted like they cared about the nicer touches on their products. In terms of the wash features... they must be kidding. The ""massage"" function is a pathetic on-off-on pulse type thing that is too far from useful or feeling good to be counted. On the BB U770 it was at least aerated and felt somewhat good. The ""vortex"" is idk how to explain it, painful? There is no enema effect in my experience. Only blood and pain. Also lacking is a decent or even noticeable auto wash feature for the nozzle. That's a serious disappointment and another fail for this bidet. If the cold water only bidet I bought at the same time as I did this one would have had a more direct spray and not an overall bottom wetting blast I would have never have taken this out of the box. Oh and the Minnesota well I have that tapped the deepest aquifer in the area is unbelievably cold so that doesn't help with either unfortunately. If I had any recourse to get rid of this weird, flimsy, under featured disaster I would in a heartbeat. I'll not be fool enough to buy bio bidet again. I would steer clear of this product. It really is simple. Do you want to shell out $400 for a piece of equipment 20 years old?"
"This has changed my life. I have a whole new outlook on the world. My nether regions are cleaner than they ever have been.

Pros. Heated seat. Ya know how you sit on a toilet after someone else just was there and it is still warm? Yeah that is ick. This is genuine warm comfort with a heated seat. A big yum now.

Heated water. Due to the heated water your orifice will not close tighter than a rusted on lug nut. Very relaxing even though the water temp gradually drops to cool temperatures during the wash cycle. Though this may be due to me using it economy mode. Gotta do my part for the environment.

Air drying. Dries up all that moisture you just squirted on your starfish and whatnots. Just beware the temperature on this. If I go above medium heat it feels like I am burning off my bum hairs.

“Vortex” look this is just a fancy and nice way to call what it really is. Enema mode. Have to sit with correct posture and get it spraying in the just right spot to work, but boy does it work. The range of emotions I have had using this probably is what therapy feels like. An enema a day keeps the doctor away!

Feminine wash. Used it by accident. Washed my balls very well.

Usage of toilet paper is no longer needed. I walk away clean and dry and ready to take on the day.

Cons. None.

Get used to it and play with its positional controls. Once you find your happy place with it you will be taken to your happy place daily on this magical seat."
Product was easily installed and works very well!
Ease of installation. Deodorizer is a nice addition. Easy to clean. Easy to be clean.
"I am looking forward to using the BB-1000 that I got. My review is only for the ease of installation and parts provided, and not for the feature or quality of the product.

The installation seemed easy enough after reading the instruction. I confident enough to do it myself although I am getting old enough I don't like crawling on the floor to make the connections behind the toilet. The problem was that they provide a half inch T adapter to attach to the water supply shut off valve, to split the line to the toilet and bidet seat. My home only had a 3/8 inch compression fitting on that valve. When I went to the big box store to try and get something that would work, I couldn't even find a shut off valve that was bigger than 3/8th inch compression. Bio Bidet includes a 3/8th to 1/2 inch adapter, but it isn't for compression fittings, so it cannot be used without leaking. So you have to get a 3/8th inch T adapter to make it work. But now the supply lines they provide are 1/2 inch and you need to connect them to a 3/8th inch compression fitting. Once again, I could not find any adapters to do this. But I did find that the 3/8th inch standard supply lines you can find at the big box stores were very affordable. So, I ended up not using a single hose or adapter they provided. I would recommend that before you try installing this you go out and buy some additional supplies. I know they claim their customer service is good, and they will send you any adapter you need, but when you are trying to replace a toilet seat and water supply lines, you don't want to have to wait for customer service to send you more adapter that should work. You should only need three things

1. A 3/8 inch compression T adapter
2. A standard 3/8 inch to 7/8th inch toilet supply line
3. A standard 3/8 inch to 1/2 inch faucet supply line

They are literally labeled as ""Toilet Supply line"" and ""Faucet Supply line"". Measure how long you think you will need, they also pick up one length longer and one length shorter of each. It will be easy to return the supply lines you don't end up using, or all of the pieced you picked up if you end up being able to use the adapters they send.

BTW, each piece ended up costing about 5 bucks, so the expense isn't that great."
"The wife likes this a lot. Does the job that it is made for. The only bad thing is the top lid. It is too flimsy. If you were to sit on it, it will break. The wife has to even be careful when she places her foot on it while shaving her legs. The top lid needs some reenforcing."
I am very happy with this bidet
"The label on the seat says lifestyle upgrade. This is truly accurate. I have used bidets in other countries and tried tushy bidets and hose bidets. This one makes bathroom time much more enjoyable. The heated seat is good but it has a kind of time keeping device built in for economy mode. If you use it at the same time every day, it will pre warm the seat for you. If your schedule is off, it won't be as warm but still nice. It memorized the water jet angle so there isn't a need to wiggle around. The warm spray doesn't last very long but is plenty to get the job done. The turbo mode is great when you need to clean up inside and I use it much more than I thought that I would. It doesn't have a nightlight but I find that the power LED is enough to find the target in the dark."
This is my 4th one over the years. I will never be without one.
Installation was easy I purchased this item due to a operation coming up in the near future. so far the item works as described.
"I was excited to get another bidet for an additional bathroom but this has been a disappointment due to the lack of warm/hot water for more than a few seconds. Our other bathroom has a more expensive koehler and it has spoiled us. You can spray hot water continuously and not have it cool off. After seeing all of the good reviews I expected a much more useable product. We live in an area that goes down below zero routinely in the winter and 15 seconds of hot water and then tap water temps in an unheated bathroom is just unacceptable. The rest of the functions are acceptable especially the water pressure, it's great but the remote has buttons that need to be pushed several times to responed"
"Love the heated seats and water. I never want to poop anywhere else. I just wish the air dryer was a little stronger, it doesn't really do much. More of a gimmick in my opinion."
"As so many others have mentioned, these electrically operated bidets can be among the most pleasant, hygienic and gratifying purchases you may ever make. Others have addressed the basic issues but, for me, the problem was in choosing the right unit. I wanted to compare this Brondell S1000 unit and the similar Bio Bidet BB-1000. Both are excellent and I don't believe you would be unhappy with either unit. There are some differences and neither is ""perfect.""

1. Power and versatility of wash: Bio wins with a huge array of options including an enema function and power enough to eject you from the toilet if you wish. However, Brondell has a gentler, variable-width main spray.

2. Warm water: Brondell wins with endless warm (not hot) water. Bio runs out of heat in seconds. In a cold climate this could be a serious shortcoming and Bio needs to re-engineer this with a continuous heater.

3. Deodorizer: Bio wins with automatic start when you sit down and more power with variable fan speed.

4. Remote control: Brondell's is smaller (about the size of a small TV remote) while Bio's is twice the size. Both are pretty clear.

5. Run time: Brondell runs for two minutes with ability to add more time, while Bio's stops after a minute and must be restarted. Manufacturers should make the run time programmable.

6. Installation: Brondell (by a bit). It has a far better water connection that connects at the toilet tank connection while Bio makes you run two lines from the angle stop. Not terrible but the Brondell allows a much neater connection. And you can use one of the ""auto shutoff"" water lines from the wall to the toilet adapter in case either the toilet or bidet supply lines should rupture.

That is my comparison after having used both for a while. If you combined the best features of both units you would probably have the perfect bidet. I know it's a bit silly to talk about toilet seat software but both units could use more programmability in the remotes. Brondell needs more power options and a better auto-start deodorizer while the Bio needs a much better hot water heater and connection adapter.

I do recommend you buy a bidet seat. You may kick yourself (in your very clean butt) for not having done so years ago."
"UPDATE: August 2021. almost 3 years later and our 2 newest Biobidets are breaking. One of them the hinges broke and even cracked the frame this time. I only weigh 185lb and my wife is much lighter. The plastic hinges on these bidets are the weak spot. The other bidet is causing electrical problems, causing the outlet to pop, tripping the breaker and it fried one of the outlet plugs. Other reviewers here mention the same type of electrical issues. Its within the 3 year warranty so I'll contact the manufacturer and see if they will warranty it. I'm giving up on this brand after 9 years of use. The cheap hinges need to updated on this model. At the high price point they charge, there are better options on Amazon. I decided to order the Ivyel GL-3 this time. It has all the features we need, enema, wash, heated water and seat, even and LED light. and for $200 less than this Biobidet model. Don't bother ordering this biobidet for deodorizer, it does nothing.

Last review 2018
I've had 2 of these installed in my home for about 6 years. To give you some feedback how long they last. The first one broke at around year 4 the second around year 6. The first one I mailed back to Biobidet and for $150 they rebuilt the pump parts etc and its been working great ever since.
The 2nd one the toilet seat actually cracked at the hinge from normal use, then a few months later the pump stopped working. I paid $499 for both of them 6 years ago. Since I see them on Amazon for $379 now I grabbed a new one instead of sending the broken one back for repairs.

Yes I bought another one even with so many other bidets out now. I could easily afford a more expensive one but after reading all the reviews on the more expensive ones, even premium models from Biobidet, this particular model the BB-1000 has good pressure for the enema water stream. It's the enema water stream that is the ultimate in personal hygiene. There are some things I don't like about this bidet but the water pressure on the enema function gets the job done! My wife and I agree we would never want to live with a bidet that doesn't have a good enema function.

CONS: Seat changes color and looks cheap and old.
Ugly off white color
Rechargeable batteries don't work in the remote, only normal AA's do.
Starts breaking after 4 years of normal use.
Expensive to send in for repairs

Pros: Water pressure for enema function is strong enough to get the job done
Seat heater and water heater work good
Remote control

Yes both of my biobidets broke, but even if I get 4 years out of it, then it's worth the price. I don't care for the off white color and faded look as it matches nothing in my remodeled bathrooms but until I can find a bidet that looks nice and has a powerful enema water stream I will stick with this one just because the water pressure works good for the first 4 years.

Update: My bidet broke again, the one that had already been rebuilt 3.5 years ago. This time its electrical and kept triggering the GFI. I called BioBidet they said ""at least"" $185 to fix it, maybe more. They also said these have a 3 year warranty and roughly 3 year life span. I decided to trash this one and just buy a new one. Found a damaged box one here on Amazon for $325. I see prices fluctuate a lot here on Amazon for this model so be patient.
I did notice some changes with the newer BB-1000 I received. The seats are all white now, not off white. Also the remote has changed appearance and the enema function is now called Vortex. I calculated I got 8.5 years out of this one having it rebuilt once for $150. Until a manufacturer makes a model with a strong enema function I will continue to buy this one even if it breaks every 4 to 5 years."
"Water warms very quickly. Cleans thoroughly. You can control time water squirts with remote. Takes awhile to dry, so be patient with that."
"This was easy to install (once I was able to disconnect the old waterline from the toilet) and fit perfectly on our existing toilet. The directions were easy to follow and all materials were included. I only needed a crescent wrench to install the entire bidet and it only took about 30 minutes to completely install. The air dryer works great, the water warms quickly, and the remote makes for easy use. The temperature of the water and the seat are easily adjusted."
Love this! Worth it!
"After 10 years, our Intelliseat ISB-200 stopped working. We started to search for a similar bidet with the most important feature: water pressure - which the Intelliseat provided.
We bought a high-end TOTO bidet seat with the hope to get the water pressure and some other upgrades like saving personalized settings, etc. Result: we were so disappointed by the TOTO bidet that we had to return it: low water pressure, fan noise and self-cleaning water features (for the toilet), which were really annoying, specially in the night when going half-sleepy to the toilet.
After doing our research, we tried the Bio Bidet BB-1000. Result: super easy installation, even the water supply hose comes included. Water pressure, is even better than of the Intelliseat.
Summary: what you want is a bidet that provides plenty of water and pressure to clean your posterior, not fancy water streams that clean and humidify the toilet bowl or LEDs that illuminate the bowl. The BB-1000 provides even a VORTEX mode which is unique on the market: if you suffer from constipation or want a real cleaning of your rectum, this feature will do it for you with a good stream of water! HIGHLY recommended bidet seat."
I was surprised how easy it was to install. Very good control and great performance. No compliant. I recommend highly those shopping for a good bidet. 👍
"Other bidet seats were too large. This fit perfectly, was easy to install and functions fine."
Product works with no major issues. Hot water times out after 5 seconds of use. There are a lot of varied water pressures but there is little difference between each setting. Dryer is not effective and times out after 10 seconds. Fairly underwhelmed but the bidet works so I can't complain too much
Great instructional video and easy to follow owner's manual. Took us only 15 min to install the Bio Bidet by Bemis BB-1000W. We live in a condominium and toilet is a small size. BB-1000W was perfect fit!
What a difference a day makes it’s what a difference a bidet makes. i’ve had toto bidets in my home and complain to the company of the low water pressure and the response was it’s the best water pressure that this company makes. I just purchased and installed a bioBidet and what a difference in pressure and quality. I highly recommend this product.
"I got this model first, because of the sale, and my wife and I were very impressed with it. We have 4 toilets so I purchased the 2000 model afterwards thinking that it would be better due to the unlimited hot water, night light, modern control, etc.
The 2000 model has half the pressure spray and drying power of the 1000. If you are new to bidets, get the 1000 model, it is amazing. Very easy to install, very easy to clean with the quick release."
"Play Video
 I was wanting to try a more robust seat Bidet. Had my Cleansence for almost 8 years, and a replaced seat one time on it. That was it's flaw.
This bidet does not live up to the same level as the Cleansence.
I chose it because it said it could handle a good deal of weight and I read it had a powerful water stream.
NOT overall impressed.
The good:
Does have a powerful stream and several spray options.
The fan works pretty well.
It's pretty easy to install.
Has a seat warmer.
Has a remote and lots to choose on it
The seat itself is wide and comfortable
The bad:
The seat sits VERY flimsy and flopsy in it's housing which causes me great concern for it's longevity (see video).
The heated water is a freaking joke. Count to three and your out of warm water. My Cleansence lasted many many minutes.
The remote is somewhat confusing, they assign a couple of functions to one button. It will take time to figure out the remote.
I will grudgingly keep this bidet but now I have to buy an external water heater just to have a decent amount of warm water. Aside from the good strong stream this is a pretty dissapointing bidet."
"Just purchased the Bio Bidet BB-1000W because my current bidet (TOTO) will not fit on the new toilet. Old one is round, new toilet is elongated. Only reason for four stars at this point is due to only being in service a few days. Here's the run down.
Pros: Priced reasonably, has remote, heated seat, heated water, water pressure control, wand position adjustment, dryer, and was a snap to install. Best of all has 3 year warranty versus TOTO's 1 year.
Cons: Is a bit louder while switching from one function to another than the TOTO. Other than that can't say about reliability at this time. Will update if needed.
All in all if it's reliable, hands down a much better value than others in that price range.
Good job Bio Bidet!
Update 12/15/2020 Had some time to use this now and have to say, this is working far better than the old TOTO. The vortex mode cleans extremely well. Just make sure you start out at the lowest water pressure level the first time and move up if needed. It literally can give you a mini-enema. The heated air mode works much better than the TOTO also. All in all, the BioBidet BB-1000W is not only better, but a best buy. Only thing left is to see it's reliability!"
"Expensive for what you get. This is Bio Bidet's premium (luxury class) seat, but there are only 15 seconds of fully warm water spray for which you must wait a full 3 minutes to get from prior use, with the spray dropping to fully room temperature water after 35 seconds. The dryer is great if your left buttock needs it, it just doesn't point to the center and it is only on the one side. The lid keeps popping off and you certainly can not sit on it. Suggestions to Bio Bidet: Make the drying air flow on both sides or at least point it toward what needs drying, having just one side pointed straight ahead just heats up my left butt cheek making it feel like it is a design mistake and a token attempt at a dryer rather than what it should be. Toto's competing unit has a much better design, even if it is on one side only too, but it is effective. And increasing water needs to increase volume not increase then force of a small high pressure water ejection that painfully exits a small hole. This makes it unusable for small kids and sensitive people who just need a better clean without pain. I suggest additional nozzles or holes to increase volume not just pressure as pressure alone is just painful and way more splash, mess,vaporization and mist without necessarily improving clean. What you really want is more volume with moderate increase in pressure and to a larger, more uniform pattern. The ""Move"" button on the remote really doesn't do it. You need to make the lid so you can sit on it like Toto's. People do that, you know. Label the off button on the unit itself off, you can't know what it does otherwise without the instructions and who has time for that in an emergency. Or make it a red octagon with a slash like most people would recognize as off. The connector hoses are thin and cheap and kink to easily around turns. An easy slide in/out design of the remote in the holder would be better as it is a struggle to get out while seated. I do like the big buttons but it is overly complex to go through settings and multi use keys and I dislike any remote they requires me to have the instruction manual nearby. It doesn't seem to retain settings and there is no storage for multiple users. On installation there is no easy way to know where to mount the slide on for the seat forward and back, it is just trial an error to get the seat far enough back without hitting the tank. There is nothing to indicate how and where to get replacement charcoal filters, pricing, or if they even have to be changed and how often. The unit water operations are a big sluggish in speed. On Toto, you punch the button and the water starts immediately and warm spray lasts forever even on a cold power on. It readies itself for spray immediately. This unit, though it does preheat water, waits until you press the cleanse button (sometimes twice) then begins to move, position and eventually clean. Then there is a slow put away before dry starts. Then you have to wait 3 minutes if you need more spray. I have a Toto and just purchased another Toto, the SW574 #01 S300e which I highly recommend:  Toto SW574#01 Washlet S300e Toilet Seat-Elongated with ewater+, Cotton"
"We have had Bidets since I had my son 7 years back. Now we have 3 and this Bidet takes the cake. It is SO comfortable (I am not skinny by the way - a bit fluffy) and my husband is a giant (6'4''). This is the most best unit we have owned. I like the control panel that you can mount, I love the size and shape of the Bidet too. It doesn't make you feel like you just lost 4 inches of seating like some of the others do. It isn't awkward in any way. Absolutely the best use of your money for something like this. If any of the other units stop functioning, we will be replacing those with this unit. Very happy with my purchase."
"I love the product, but the remote control panel doesn’t always work, so you need to push the button 10 times before it functions properly."
This product is easy to install; easy to operate; also very comfortable. I ordered two more already.
"If you are on the fence about buying, get off the fence and get on the toilet with one of these! You won’t regret it. Just make sure you have a plug in nearby. But it’s worth putting one in to use this, if you don’t."
"This is our first use of a bidet. Selecting a unit that was quality built, and simple to use features was important to us. The BioBidet BB1000 has a complete array of the most popular features listed in bidet reviews for first time buyers.
Installation was easy, with clearly written directions. My only problem encountered was created by our toilet being installed in a very cramped corner, and having limited access to change out the old water valve to the new bidet unit that required more than finger tightening to ensure it would not leak water.

We completed the install within 45 minutes, and are extremely pleased with the heated water spray, heated seat and the seat cover engineered to close slowly. We are very happy with this unit, and expect the quality to last beyond 5 years in our two person household."
The Bio Bidet does not position inself to clean the right areas of your body unless you bend far over. The button to change the position of the wand does not really move it. I have to bend way over and almost fall of the the toilet seat to get it to hit the spots to clean.
"I have never had one and it was easy to install. I had put a electrical outlet when I remodeled my bathroom with this feature in mind for future. I finally bought it and I am not disappointed. The heated water, the slow auto lid close, the remote with the ability to apply more or less pressure or areas of water application are excellent. Plumbing it was not an issue. I did it myself! Very easy install. The best part was the heated seat! I love this bidet and it was my very first and I have no complaints whatsoever."
"In the realm of bathroom luxury and functionality, the Bio Bidet BB2000 stands out as a true game-changer. As someone who values both comfort and cleanliness, I've been thoroughly impressed with this bidet's performance.

Exceptional Water Pressure: The first thing to note is the outstanding water pressure. It's powerful enough to ensure a thorough clean, yet adjustable to suit different sensitivities and preferences. This feature alone sets the BB2000 apart from its competitors.

User-Centric Features: The array of user-friendly features is remarkable. The heated seat is a godsend on chilly mornings, creating a cozy, welcoming experience. The adjustable nozzle positions cater to all users, ensuring a personalized and effective cleaning experience. Moreover, the warm air dryer is a delightful addition, eliminating the need for toilet paper and thus being eco-friendlier.

Eco-Friendly and Hygienic: Speaking of eco-friendliness, the BB2000 is a win for the environment. Reduced toilet paper usage means less waste and a smaller environmental footprint. Additionally, the self-cleaning function of the nozzle maintains a high standard of hygiene, which is paramount in any bathroom setting.

Easy Installation and Sleek Design: The installation process was surprisingly straightforward, and the sleek design of the unit seamlessly blends with the bathroom decor. It doesn't feel like an add-on but rather an integral part of my bathroom.

Convenience at Its Best: The remote control is intuitive and user-friendly, making operation a breeze. Whether it's adjusting the temperature or pressure, every setting is at your fingertips.

In conclusion, the Bio Bidet BB2000 is more than just a bidet; it's an experience that elevates the everyday act of personal hygiene into a luxurious, comforting ritual. It's an investment in your comfort and well-being. Highly recommended for anyone looking to upgrade their bathroom experience."
 We're super excited about our new bidet. Bidets are not just for the rich anymore. It was very affordable and so easy to install. My favorite feature is the heated toilet seat. We love it and we're so happy to save money on toilet paper. Our septic system will perform better without all of that toilet paper being flushed into the system. I did a lot of research before making my purchase and I'm completely satisfied with my decision.
"I've been to Japan a few times and every time I come back to the US, I always have to adjust to our boring toilet seats. I was initially apprehensive because I wasn't sure I could install it, but this seat with all the bells and whistles was on sale so I took a chance. I paid about $530 for this seat which looking back, is quite a bit, but I don't regret my purchase one bit. As of writing this review, I have used this toilet seat multiple times a day, nearly everyday, for almost 90 days now.

Installation was a lot easier than I thought it would be. The only thing I've ever done with a toilet beside use and flush it, is use a plunger. So for someone with no plumbing experience, it was still easy to install by myself. Took me about an hour, with the longest part being draining all the water from the toilet tank. Essentially all you have to do is replace the seat and reroute a water connections. You will need an outlet in order to power the seat. I only have one outlet in my bathroom and it's on the other side of bathroom from where the toilet is. I used an extension cord have had no problems.

Pros:
- Easy installation.
- Lots of bidet functions, dryer, and heated seat. The heated seat alone means a lot to me, especially in the winter months. Don't expect the dryer to dry you completely, but it will make you considerably more dry than if you don't use it at all.
- Adjustable nozzles. You can adjust the nozzles using the remote and move them forward or backward.
- Adjustable water temperature and heated seat temperature.
- Energy saving function. I like the energy saving function because it keeps the seat and bidet water relatively warm and then gradually gets warmer the longer you use them. Without it, the toilet seat will always be at whatever temperature you have it set at, which may not really be necessary. With energy saver turned on, it's slightly warm when you sit on it and gets warmer the longer you sit. Same with the bidet water temperature. It will be slightly warm at first and then go up in temperature as it runs.
- Responsive, battery-operated remote. Also like that it displays the time.
- Nightlight and quick access buttons so you don't have to pull out the remote to activate the bidet or front wash functions.
- Easy to clean. Care instructions are printed on a sticker that's underneath the lid so you don't have to pull out the manual if you need to reference something quick.

Cons:
- Bidet doesn't keep the temperature for the entire runtime. The default timer for the bidet is 1 min 30 sec and while it starts out warm (or hot if you have set that way), by the end, it's noticeably cooler. Not cold, but just cooler. Similar to when you start running out of hot water in the shower.
- Some of the icons are the remote could be a little clearer. I'm pretty good with technology and it took a bit of studying to get used to the remote. Just turning on the bidet or dryer is easy, but figuring out how to adjust them isn't as clear.
- The dryer makes the back of the toilet seat pretty hot. While the actual air that's blowing on you isn't that hot, the area where the dryer is housed in the seat does get hot. Not enough to burn you, but it's pretty hot if you just sit on top of it.
- Looks a bit bulky on the toilet. I have basic, round seat toilets and this bidet does look quite large on it. The seat itself will fit any standard round or elongated toilet, but appearance-wise, it may take some getting used to.
- The nightlight is very bright. It shines underneath the bathroom door, and my toilet is all the way on the other end of the bathroom.

I would recommend this seat for anyone who poops (which is everyone). It's also really useful for women while you're on your period."
"""I've been absolutely thrilled with this product. The installation was a breeze, and it fits perfectly on my toilet. What I love most is the remote control and the variety of settings it offers. Unlike a previous bidet I tried and returned, this one consistently maintains a warm water flow and does an outstanding job of keeping me clean.

However, I do have a concern due to my irritable bowel condition, which occasionally leads to diarrhea episodes. I've noticed that there are some very narrow seams between the top and bottom seats where stool can accumulate, and it's challenging to thoroughly clean them out."""
I researched many pot'l products but opted for the Biobidet 2000. So glad I did. It arrived in pristine new condition & was clear and easy to set up. I've only had it for a couple of days but it works perfectly and it's a joy.
"I had a handyman install this based upon a suggestion from a friend who has a lower model of the same manufacturer’s bidet seat which was not really necessary. I could have easily installed this myself.

Once installed, which took about 20 minutes maximum, I tried the bidet immediately. BIG MISTAKE! Make sure to program the remote to warm the water and the seat before using the bidet. For me, it was installed in winter, so the ice cold water was freezing me out. I screamed, but I couldn’t get up until I turned the water off. Once I programmed the remote, I set my seat and water at highest levels of temperature/power. The electricity bill as a result went up about $10, but it is beyond worth it. I use far less paper now too. The $10 is worth it.

I am not a tiny woman, so I refused to get a model with solely side controls. Nonetheless, this unit (BB2200) has two or three basic buttons on the left side of the seat, so in the event you are missing the remote or it has no battery power to work, the side controls work to do an Automatic Wash Cycle, one other cycle I am unsure of, and even has a blue light to help guide you to the toilet in the dark.

The only negative thing I can say about this unit is the enema function which I just tried for this review does not have strong enough pressure; it appears to have the same reassure as the spray button when on high to clean your rear end. The front cleaning button for us women has a nice amount of pressure and can even feel a bit pleasant (lol). I love this bidet and have no complaints whatsoever.

I got it just in time for the toilet paper rush that occurred due to Covid-19. I do not need toilet paper anymore except to pick up dog’s excrement from the wee wee pad. I do, however, use a wet wipe after cleaning myself to get off dripping water and to check my rear ended to verify it is entirely clean. It almost always had nothing on the wipe. Once in a while, you need a final wet wipe for me to ensure you are fresh and clean, but you never need more than one wipe. In fact, this cleans so effectively, I rarely if ever use the full two or three minute cycles (depending on area being cleaned) of the streaming water the remote/device counts down. I often switch to the dry mode before the water stops. The dryer works fine, but it is not terribly strong. It also can start to get very warm on the side of the seat opposite the buttons if you have seat heat on high. If not, I cannot say.

There is an air sanitizer function that you can use by setting remote appropriately, so when you go, you do not know! No Poo Pourie needed. The door to sanitizer closes when water or fan is operating.

The one suggestion I have is learn your remote functions and set them as you wish before you use this bidet seat. To me, they and the remote itself were not entirely intuitive. If you want to test the settings or the bidet, it is essential to cover under the seat with double layer of Saran Wrap or a plastic bag that goes over the seat and place seat down before you start streaming water. Finally, the unit has touch sensitivity to operate. Therefore, while testing, the water will not flow if you do not have a finger’s worth of touch on the seat. If you get up while the water is flowing, it will stop once you have no contact with the seat which will cause water to spill onto seat.

Finally, the seat cannot be sanitized with harsh chemicals, or it will eventually crack/wear down the plastic on the seat. To clean the seat and under it, I use a soft cloth with vinegar and some water. Good luck and enjoy if you get this. You cannot go wrong.

P.S. Price varies between $529 and $699 back when I bought it from day to day, so watch the prices when you buy this item."
"My third Bidet seat was just installed. First one (bio Bidet) lasted 12 years and probably would have lasted more but the Buyer of my house wanted me to leave it. The 2nd is at my summer house and is a different brand. Third and newest is Bio Bidet and just installed. Having experienced two brands I can say without any qualms that the Bio Bidet is way better than the other (and the other was not cheap or a bargain). When I have to replace it, you know which one I will buy. Great remote controller - convenient, easy to read, intuitive. Great features - spray varieties, heat, night light and more. Great customer support - sent me an email with all the compatible toilets and the measurements you need to check for various bolts. My brother came for a visit and now owns his own - he claims he bought it for his wife but I know better. My Bridge Club begs to play at my house."
"Bidet has plenty of warm water and pressure for cleaning your behind area.
Also the jet stream can be set at varying pressures, angles and temperature of the water jets.
Heated toilet seat makes the bidet more enjoyable to sit on especially when it is chilly in the house in the morning. Air drying is very functional and works well drying your nether regions in about 3 minutes. The air dryer does have an electric coil smell that doesn't seem to clear up over time of use, but I am sure it will eventually clear up.

Had to work around some plumbing fixtures that did not fit old piping valves coming out of wall. If you have a more modern house then you probably won't have to worry about retrofitting stuff.

All in all pleasure to use this bidet. Have had it now running for about six weeks and I must say that
everything about this bidet is enjoyable"
"Honestly, I have used bidets at my sister's and mom's houses and understood the appeal, but just never pulled the trigger until last week. To be honest, they both have models that are fine, but a bit basic, and so it didn't seem that big of an upgrade. With my mother visiting for a few months, it was time to take the plunge and get one so she would be at home here and not have to go back to the ""stone ages"" (as she puts it). I did my research, identified the models I was interested in and decided on this one. VERY happy I did.

First off, installation was a breeze and it only took about 20 minutes to get it solidly in place. The only suggestion I might give to the company would be to add a flat plug head instead of the standard plug end, mine sticks away from the wall/outlet in an inconvenient location behind the toilet tank. Not a huge deal, I got a 1 foot flat plug extension and will bury the cord/plug somehow behind the tank with that.

Once installed, I got to use it and, well......sooooooo much better than using toilet paper. Significantly better than the more basic bidets I have used previously. The options for positioning, adjusting the strength of the water stream, temperatures(s), are super easy to use and actually work very well. Water stream much more powerful than others, really don't have anything negative to say and thus far am actually ecstatic with the product. I'll update here if for some reason that changes, but it seems sturdy, so not too worried.

The only other suggestion I would make to the company would be to add whatever tiny amount of memory required to the remote and allow a user to save a specific routine to use regularly. Couldn't be that hard to add this, just add one more button called ECO to cover what the current SAVE button does, then change the SAVE button to remember the last sequence if you hit that instead of the STOP/square button, after which you use the arrows to move between a list of users 1-6 and hit SAVE again to assign it to that user. You can invoke a saved routine by hitting SAVE button at the start, then using arrows to select which user and SAVE again to start that specific routine. Just a suggestion."
"I have been a bidet user for many many years. I''ve actually had three or four from the same company, but I was gettiing excellent service from the company that made them, as well as great deals. I accidentally dropped the remote into the water, so I used an older one they had refurbished for me. Worked great until the seat cracked.

So thats when I started shopping... reading everything I could get my hands on until ""Christmas in July"" was almost over and then I made a decision and bought the BB2000. I was on the fence about it at first because there were some not so nice reviews. But on my way around the net, I found an bidet store that couldn't say enough great things about the unit and that it was his best selling unit. On that site he had Toto, Tushy, Blondel, Bidet Mate, Kohler and many more. But this was the device he recommends to his patrons.

I am very glad that I did. I'd been having trouble with the Coco not getting myself clean and needing three or four rounds to get completely clean. That doesn't happen any more. This thing is quite effiicent and it does a great job. I have gone twice around but there are years of correcting to do. The BEST thing about this bidet is that it has a clock that converts to a countdown timer when it is running. How ingenius! I was ready to buy a small 3 minute hour glass before I installed the BB2000. I actualy procrastinated before I installed it because there was just too much going on. But I've used it every day since early November and it just keeps on ticking!

If there is one thing that I would suggest is that BioBidet include a brush that would be able to get into the crannies on the toilet seat. Then the bristles would be the right length and be stiff enough to do the job without hurting the device. I'm using an old denture brush. Its stiff enough but not sure that its long enough to get everything. I draw the line before going into flossing; that's just a little toooooooo over the top.

Another suggestion is to add indicators lights for the two motion settings (oscillate and massage) so that I can see that those selections are on, especially if they have diminished feeling."
"I have to say I was unsure after we had it installed. We had our toilets exchanged out for the 19"" so had the plumbers install the bidets. Originally we had issues with the remote. I called and they had me unplug to reset the unit, that appeared to do the trick. Next time we used it it wasn't working again so had to use the side buttons, which are a little awkward. Called and they made arrangements to send 2 new remotes (we bought 2 units) Over the weekend I noticed if I turned the remote around, with the light facing behind me they worked. I continued doing that over the weekend and today, Monday. I tried it held in my hand in a normal position. They work now. I don't know if it's a design issue where the control need to sync up, but it works now. I find the units large and a bit bulky looking but are more reasonable than investing in a bidet toilet, so it's the price we pay. I read complaints on their customer service and my dealings were as good as you can get so I have no idea what occurred there. Function takes a bit of practice but after a few tries I have temperature nd nozzle setting customized and which functions work best for me. Quite happy with the purchase with the exception of the hic cup with the control."
"Disclaimers - I have had this less than a week and this is a ""first impressions"" review that will be updated over time if it needs to be. Also, there may be some slightly icky medical descriptions in here, so make note of that. It's a longer review and I'll do a pro and con format. My initial situation - I'm a larger guy who had ""roids"" in the rear and HAD to have an operation to fix the issues. So yes... painful before, and stiches in the rear (ouch and OUCH), and I'm still in recover from that. TP is an absolute NO in that situation, and while wet wipes are slightly better, you still go through a ton of them to properly clean yourself in this scenario. Tried a travel bidet bottle, but they are awkward to hold, squeeze, aim and use at the same time, so I splurged and bought the Bio Bidet 2000. Observations so far:

The PROS:

1) Flat-out, they clean you VERY well compared to the above mentioned alternatives. It heats water on demand (not via a storage tank), and has a heated seat if you need it. The water rod extends out of it and can be moved up and down (length wise) by a few inches to hit varied areas back there, or you can have it move up and down on it's own. There are five levels of water power spray (I am not making it passed 2 yet - it CAN be powerful) and there's an ""enema"" spray that's a more narrow spray of water and stronger. Lots of spray options.

2) Remote control is large and has every option on it. You can adjust spray strength, rod extension, auto or full manual controls, adjust water temp from cold to very warm, dryer heat, seat heat, and more. There's a very basic control panel on the side of the seat that will let you do the basic ""male, female, stop"" controls should something happen to the remote.

3) This particular model is rated to hold up to 400lbs. If you are a heavier/larger person it's one of the ONLY models that goes up that high weight rated wise. And yes, you pay for that out of the wallet. I had a plumber install it since I can't get down due to the surgery to do it, but it took the pro about 30 minutes to do it right.

4) Comes with a 3 year warranty standard - you can (at the time of this writing) extend it to 6 years for $99 from the mfg.

The CONS:

1) The seat is rated to 400lbs, but feels like a cheaper plastic seat you can get anywhere. The mfg assured me they ARE rated that high, but a tip - she said the plastic used CAN degrade over time if you use the seat heater function a lot, as the heat can degrade the plastic. So... use the heat less, and there's less chance of this. I live in a warmer area, so heated seats are not necessary for me.

2) The oval seat I got is SMALLER than a typical oval seat size, opening wise. I guess it's because there are mechanical parts in the back of the seat that need room, but it's noticeably smaller opening wise than my old standard seat. Comfortable enough to sit on, but almost feels like a kid's seat to a larger person - more averaged sized people may not feel this way.

3) This uses (give or take) up to around 1500 watts of power if you have the water temp and seat temp cranked up along with the seat in-use. Make note of that if you have an older home with older circuit boxes. You can tone these settings down or use the ""eco"" mode to save power. If I crank it up, it literally makes my bathroom lights flicker when using it. The power cord is only around 3 feet, so if your outlet is on a wall and not next to the toilet, invest in a heavy-capacity extension cord for it.

4) You CANNOT sit on the lid - it's just frankly, cheap plastic. You can only sit on the seat.

5) The air dryer is in a spot where on ME, it literally just blows warm air on the side of my left rear cheek and does not um, ""go exactly where it needs to go"" - this is me, or I would think larger people in general. More averaged sized people may not have this issue.

Summary: While there are some cons for me, ultimately it boils down to one thing - it's ability to clean you in that area, and in that regard, it's a HUGE pro. Recovering from surgery, and also having mild IBS type gnarly visits to the bathroom sometimes, this device really DOES clean a whole lot better than wiping, or using travel bottles. It's literally like a car wash for your rear end. It will help you in terms of cleanliness but also help your demeanor, because anyone who has to spend a lot of time wiping and cleaning after every single trip to the bathroom for whatever reason will tell you - it wears you down mentally too, as well as sometimes even making you sore physically. This should help a lot. Does it completely eliminated the need for TP or wipes 100%? No. You'll still need to dry yourself after, and maybe use 1-2 wipes etc. But it will cut those down considerably.

These are certainly not cheap. And if you are not someone who is over 250lbs (the rating for most of these type toilets) you can probably get one of the other models rated for those sizes, because this again, has a rating of 400lbs, and you're paying a lot for that extra feature. Shop around but what it boils down to is, a good bidet toilet seat is going to (not exaggerating) change your life in terms of being clean ""down there"" compared to what you've probably been doing your whole life. Happy spraying."
"I cant just give a stuffy review of this product because I am in love! I waited way too long to purchase my very first Bidet, which is bad and good. Bad only because I should have not waited so long and good because I waited long enough to allow for the quality and technology to catch up making the experience that much better. I knew that if I was going to take the plunge into this Bidet thing, I wanted the best and this is it!

First the love story. Ok, so without being graphic there are those of us who need to use way too much T.P. to clean ourselves completely. And even after using way, way too much paper ""we"" still find that we cannot wear white underwear because we always find our underwear stained anyway! I can tell you that the Bio Bidet Bliss BB2000 is indeed ""Bliss"" because the cleaning experience is soooo satisfying and cleansing! Multi levels of warmth for the seat, multi levels of warmth of water for the spray, and the fact that you can change the water pressure and location of the spray just makes it a luxury experience. I chose the BB2000 after researching the high end Bidets and it was chosen for its boasting of spray power and its warranty along with the spray modes. The first time I used the BB2000 was a bit... errr... interesting and surprising, but in no time was I loving the feeling of the cleaning and just knowing how much better cleaning I was getting. After working my way through the instruction and playing with the remote for a few minutes, I had it mastered and wow, it was fantastic. I use just a few squares of paper now to dab myself dry and found I was clean as coming out of the shower! I was in love, it was worth every penny. I can now wear white underwear again!

Ok, now for the boring parts that are important:

First off, this Bidet was simple to install with minimal tools. Even if you are not handy with tools or installing things like this, there are tutorials on YouTube that can help. Just be careful when you tighten the PLASTIC threaded fittings. If you cross thread them you are in big trouble. THIS is my only complaint about this product that may or may not be justified. I wish the input water fitting to the Bidet was metal to metal but it's all plastic. It certainly does the job, no leaks, but just feels a little more fragile than what an all metal connection would offer. Be careful about over tightening plastic fittings. They need to be snug but if you crank them down you will crack or strip them in the worst case.

Its important to have a dedicated GFCI circuit to plug the device into and it is recommended in the instructions as well. I am no electrician so I did hire one to install the outlet. You really want to protect this Bidet because ALL of the fuses are INTERNAL and you cannot reset anything if you blow and internal fuse. Your Bidet becomes just and expensive toilet seat if that happens.

You want this model like this because it works primarily by remote with only a small function button on the side that is best just left as a night light, which is great too. The Bidets with the controls attached to the seat are certainly subject to being damaged if leaned on and just more surfaces to clean. There is a sensor in the seat so you cannot accidently activate the Bidet and make a mess. The BB2000 looks a little thicker at the back hinge side , but noting ugly. It has a quiet soft closing lid and is easy to clean. The spray nozzles are all parked internally when not in use and self clean before and after use. The rest of the Bidet is easy to clean as well.

The remote, after you read the instructions and used it a little bit is easy to use. The only thing it lacks is not being back lit or illuminated in any way. I realize we don't normally do our business in the dark, but when I have a need late at night and dont want to turn the light on, I have to use the Bidet night light to see the buttons more clearly. The remote is a little bit large for some tastes, but I have no problem with it. It has a sticky back plate if you want to mount it.

There is a higher pressure enema function too. Let me just say it is a bit stingy when you use it. Its a pretty fine stream that can be a bit uncomfortable. As for me, I guess I'm just too... something... because I cant seem to use it as it was intended, not quite able to get through. But, I do used it to power clean and its very effective! All the cleaning modes are on a timer too which is good I guess.

I see that in the reviews a few may have had problems nearing the fourth year of use. There is always somebody who will have a bad experience and so far I am problem free, but this Bidet is so awesome, if it breaks one day after the warranty expires, I will gladly pay for a new one no matter what... yep, I am that much in love. I even wait to come home to do... yeah, that... because I have become such a toilet snob now that I joke with my friends that only heathens use paper to clean themselves! Its so good.

If you read this far let me tell you the next thing to do is JUST BUY IT! Being free from using all that paper and knowing that when the next toilet paper crisis comes I will just giggle because this thing is awesome. It is a now brainer and worth the money for the quality. There are lots of cheaper Bidets out there, and I was tempted to save some money, but when you research build and quality this is the way to go. Sure, you can drive a Yugo and it will get the job done I guess, but this Cadillac will get you there in luxury, comfort, and in a way that will do the job better with gadgets that really make a difference! Just do it and enjoy!"
"Our first bidet after a trip to Tokyo a month ago and despite the luxury price we went with this model elongated BB2000, as we were not sure about wanting to replace the whole toilet (we ended up replacing another toilet with a smart one and review is available via my profile for Arrisea). Now the first thing we noticed is that the pipes they provide did not create a proper seal and necessitated a run to the hardware store to find the right 3/8 and 1/2 inch combinations. The instructions were very clean and a PDF sheet of all the functions are stuck to my wall next to the remote. I called the support line to talk about the pipes and they promptly sent me the same replacement, which was of no use for now, as i was using Stainless steel pipes.
As others have noted , securing the toilet to the bowl with those plastic knobs via a metal plate creates a sliding toilet seat problem. After first use, I noticed that the seat seemed smaller than my previous regular elongated seat, so I got the tape measure to verify as seen in the picture (most smart toilet seats are smaller by and 1 to 1.5 inches. Now I am a skinny guy but I was still sliding down and had to squeeze my rear to make sure I was seated properly when the water sprayed!
Lastly the blue light, very distracting but glad that it can be turned off. Despite the price tag it will be still recommended assuming that the warranty holds up. Will update if that changes"
"So we got our first bidet seat for xmas 2018. It was a Brondell E600. Just to set the stage...I am 6'3"" and weigh about 270lbs and my wife is 5'8"" and weighs about 160lbs. We really liked everything about this bidet with one exception. It has a water tank with heater and the warm water would run out within about 15-20 seconds even though most everything I read said it would last 40-60 seconds. Now, it really only takes about 10-15 seconds of washing to get the job done BUT...I like to let it go a little longer just to make sure it's all nice and clean on the ole bottom so we would run out of warm water most of the time. Due to this, we decided to move that seat to our kid's bathroom and order another one for me and the wife. Wifey said that the Brondell E600 also didn't seem like it hit the right spot on her front wash and she had to wiggle around a bit to get that done but it wasn't a deal breaker for her because she liked everything else about it. We started shopping around again and decided on the Biobidet BB-2000.

Biobidet BB-2000 - This seat has a lot of features but we felt like the quality of this seat was not as good as the Brondell. We also noticed that the seat did not stay very warm. It seemed like it was just about room temp all the time, after you sat down for about 30 seconds you could feel it start warming up. It almost seemed like it was in eco mode all the time no matter whether it was set to low or high. It did seem to have an endless supply of warm water no matter how long you let the wash cycle run. I ended up contacting someone at bidetking.com and asking about the seat warming and was told that they have one in their office and it's the same way. We decided the cost was too much to just settle so we returned it and have now ordered a Brondell swash 1200.

Brondell Swash 1200 - waiting on delivery so can't say at this time but feel confident we will love it.

Summary:
After owning a Brondell, a Biobidet and a Alpha JX we have decided that of them all we liked the Brondell brand a lot more. It just seems like the quality is better. The seat is nice and toasty at all times even on the low and medium settings. On the Biobidet and the Alpha we noticed when you get up from the toilet the seat wants to lift up with you. That did not happen on the Brondell. Seems like that is due to the heavy dutyness (don't think that's a real word) of the seat of the Brondell. The lid of the Biobidet seemed very flimsy and weak. The Alpha was better in that regard. The Alpha seemed to clean the worst of them all that we've tried. This is a significant investment (well worth it in our opinion) and you should be completely satisfied since you will be using it daily. We truly believe based on experience now that the amount of toilet paper we will save the seat will pay for itself in 2 yrs or less.

Obviously, there is a fair amount of personal preference with an item like a bidet but for us, we think the Brondell brand is significantly better quality than all the others we tried. I can also say that I used to travel to Japan quite a bit and they almost solely use Toto brand there so I have tried them also and the Brondell brand seems everybit as good as a Toto and Brondell seems to have more features for less money than Toto.

My wife said that both the Biobidet and the Alpha did a better job washing her front parts but I believe that's because they both have 2 separate wands (one for the rear and one for the front) which allows for better washing of a ladies parts than just having one wand for both like the Brondell E600 we had first. The new Brondell swash 1200 we have ordered has 2 wands so we are expecting it to wash her front lady parts as well as the Biobidet and Alpha.

No matter which one you choose, if you have never had a bidet seat, I think you'll find it's a game changer and you'll wonder how you have gone so long and never owned one. We will never be without one again. It works so much easier and better than toilet paper and/or wipes. Is better for your sewer or septic system and the environment. The Brondell washed so well that even after the wash you can wipe with toilet paper and find the paper will be completely clean! Other than using the single piece of toilet paper to dry off with, you wouldn't need to wipe at all. That reminds me, the dryer function on them all is pretty much worthless so don't let that be a deciding factor in your evaluation of any of them. Oh, and my wife really likes the blue nightlight function on the Brondell too. Hope this helps anyone who is shopping to help you make a decision and get the most bang for your buck."
"Love having this in my house, works well, just my experience in Japan (tokyo marriott) was better (better spray technology in Japan). For those reviewers that say they dont use toilet paper/ or need toilet paper - gross… A wipe at end of process is just good quality control/hygiene - there are good days and then not so good days/ variability in the biology of pooping. And nothing is perfect/ thats why man created TP! I am also glad i spent the extra money to have warm water on demand, allows me to do 2 wash cycles back to back without worrying about running out of warm water."
"First, let me say, you know you have really made it in this world, if you can afford a $700 toilet seat - just saying...

As you know, they make dedicated bidets. In our little bathroom, that was not an option. I looked at a lot of bidet toilet seats. Buying a cheap bidet toilet seat is like buying a cheap parachute or a bargain cardiac pacemaker. You probably aren't going to be happy with it. So, after you get over the sticker shock of a high end bidet toilet seat, and buy it; you still have to install it.

First, you have to remove your old toilet seat. This typically is an easy job. My old toilet seat wanted to make a crusade out of staying on. The seat bolts had rusted and you just about have to stand on your head to see what you are doing... but I eventually won and without breaking the toilet.

When you look at the video or instructions, apparently we have the only house that doesn't have an electrical outlet right next to toilet near where the water supply line is located. Rather than add another $300 to this boondoggle project (wife driven) I figured I could run an extension cord from the electrical outlet near the sink and mirror, thread it behind the vanity, and sneak the plugs behind same, as so to avoid the employment of an electrician. Alright... I should have bought a nice pretty white extension cord, a fact which is not lost on my wife (patiently waiting for the right moment to drop that bombshell). The directions are pretty straightforward and there are installation videos available on YouTube. You will need to shut the water off at the cutoff, flush the toilet, disconnect a few hoses, add a few fittings, reconnect the hoses, turn on the water, check for leaks, and then plug it in. An adjustable wrench or two is all you will need. If it weren't for my old toilet seat, fighting for its dear life, this would have been fairly easy.

This is the Cadillac of bidet toilet seats. The water that is squirted up at your ..... is warm. As I write this review, it is 15 degrees in Fairfax, VA. The water coming into our house from the outside is probably about 40 degrees. Having freezing cold water shoot up your kazoo is not the way I want to wake up in the morning. The water warmer is a good thing. The seat itself is heated and stays nice and toasty. There is a sensor in the seat to know if you are actually sitting down, so you can't accidentally spray water everywhere in your bathroom. This is a good feature.

My wife, the Princess, will never read an instruction manual. Me, I read them twice, once before installation and again during initial operation. Not my Queen of the Nile. She will seat on the can and push every button on the remote that comes with this thing until she figures it out - by trial and error. That is her way; tactile and hands on.

Now, our only remaining challenge, is where to mount the remote control holder / bracket. Her Highness is left-handed, and I am right-handed, so this is a decision that may never be made.

Is thing thing worth $700? That all depends on the value you place on domestic tranquility."
"The Bio Bidet Bliss BB2000 was just what I hoped it would be. It took about 15-20 minutes to install, including removing the old seat. The unit was well packaged to prevent damage in shipment. It was delivered in just a few days. I tried all the features. I was especially pleased with the immediate warm water and the water pressure."
Have been using for three years and it is going strong. I had a dedicated bidet at home before having to go to a nursing home so the need for the bidet seat. The bio bidet seat is better than the more expensive bidet. The water heater is really good as is the air dryer. The remote control is really good. If you are shopping for a bidet seat you won't be disappointed with this one. It is 5 star all the way.
"This replaced a very old Toto seat that was failing and perhaps I am spoiled, but this seat doesn't quite measure up. The seat is not as comfortable and not as warm, and those are my two big complaints. The rest of the features are the equal or better than the Toto. One feature that is better is the ""deep clean"" option. Without being too graphic, you will never be constipated again. The Toto used to run out to warm water while this seat provides an endless stream. On the downside the first shot of water is often quite cold, but it quickly warms up. Overall I recommend this and would buy it again (I did, I now own three of them)."
"this one has a stronger stream, but it splashes all over. it gets dirtier quicker than our last one too. seems they could alter the seat and backboard angle to reduce that. Also, the water isn’t instantly warm, the beginning is a bit colder. our last one didn’t do tgag. would buy a different one next time"
Omg this is the best purchase I have made in a long time . I have trouble with hemmoroids so wiping hurts. Now after a bowel movement I press the button and nice warm water hits my bottom for 2 minutes and I can add nozzle oscillation and massage and then hit dry mode and when I’m done I don’t need a bit of toilet tissue - this is a godsend - I hope it never gives out - def buy one now
"I haven't bought toilet paper in nearly 3 years and still love going to the bathroom because of this thing. It's hard to describe how it feels to sit on a heated seat, have warm water clean you, drying with a bidet towel or air dryer, then being clean, all without touching anything. I haven't had swamp-ass or any issues with finding out I'm not clean later. I also love the enema setting, which is a godsend when you're sick, can't go, or if you ate something too hot. I wish it had a bowl light, a better remote(at least with lights on the buttons) and the countdown on the remote were accurate, as the 30 second ""auto"" wash/dry is actually around 22 seconds once the nozzle starts spraying you. I'm just nitpicking, though."
"Once you try one of these you will understand why my entire family is in love with a biobidet. The Asian and European cultures have been way ahead of us on the hygiene that this system provides. We now have two and our adult son is getting ready to purchase one. Easy to install, easy to use and that clean feeling you get is mind blowing"
Could use lower temp settings for seat heater. And low pressure would be nice for the wash. Remote went sideways literally a few months in though. Manufacturers are replacing
"Working in the transportation industry gives you hemorrhoids. Not figurative ones, literal ones. Let's just get that intro out of the way.

Between the sandpaper TP in truck stops and sitting down all day long, they will develop within a few years and stay with you for life. Further, you can't have alcohol or spicy foods once you have them.

After getting the BioBidet, this all changed. I needed something that would spray warm/hot water instead of cold water as the cold aggravates the hemorrhoids to no end. Actually, you need warmth to settle them down. Anyways, the warm water and heated seats are the highlights of the BB2000. I jokingly refer to it as The Booty Blaster 2000 but it really does the job. You will save big time on TP and your hygiene will take a noticeable leap. Do not fear the bidet becoming gross or contaminated. If you clean it like you clean your toilet (bleach toilet, use bathroom cleaners and antiseptics for the BB2000) you will have no problems.

Just keep a close eye on the nooks and crannys. Oh and also, my room mate uses the heated dryer a lot. The BB2000 makes your exit point noticeably cleaner, just be sure not to give up wiping completely. You still need to verify.

Basically, everyone should have this."
I have 2 bad wrists and am getting ready for surgery to have them fused. I bought this because of current pain and the upcoming surgery to facilitate cleaning up because of range of motion. I've been using this for 3 days now and the only problem I've seen so far is that I didn't get this sooner!! I feel cleaner with no painful wrists. Everyone should have one!!
Install instructions are WRONG. The small tab on the catch plate must be towards the rear of the seat not towards the front as the instructions show
"This was incredibly easy to install (10 min max). New hardware and hoses, stable, and great quality. The functions are great. Highly recommend."
"I bought this in anticipation of an upcoming back surgery. The warm seat and warm water are awesome, especially in the winter time when our bathrooms are extra cold! Installation was very easy. I took a star off because I bought this model specifically because the description says it has a “child wash” but it has no such feature. Our son likes it anyway. Also the dryer doesn’t really get you very dry, we still need to dab dry with paper."
"To preface this: I had washlets on my toilets for a number of years. Then moved cross country, and although I brought my current washlets with me, they weren't compatible with my new place's toilets (bowl shape was the issue).

I should have replaced them, but procrastinated in doing so - good washlets aren't usually cheap!

Finally ordered a Bio-Bidet washlet (my previous were a different company's) after too many years - why did I wait so long????

It's been a long time between my experiencing my former brand and this Bio-Bidet - so I can't give an accurate comparison, and will leave this as my experience with the Bio-Bidet Bliss 20000 only.

So far, my household is pretty pleased!

Pros:
-ease of use
-relatively competitive price
-remote shows more information than most bidets with a handheld remote (the last washlet/bidet I had with a similar remote was a Blooming). Many have minimal information, or no screen.

Cons:

-wish the warm water reservoir/capacity was a bit larger. It's not endless, instant warm water. I don't expect ""endless,"" but a little more longevity would be nice.

-heated fan/dryer - as others have pointed out, the fan is positioned on the left side of the washlet, and dries unevenly. I can agree with the temperature level comments as well - it gets pretty hot!! I usually use the dryer for just a bit, and blot any water remaining

Neutral:

- I bought an inline filter from the manufacturer for the bidet's intake line as we have hard water, and I'd like to try and minimize its effect on clogging the nozzles, etc. Neither the filter nor the bidet itself come with an additional piece of piping to fit it with, and it can't attach directly to the bidet's elbow joint safely. IMHO, there should be additional literature included with the bidet, and on the sales descriptions of it, that point out the availability of the filter, as well as what extra plumbing pieces you'll need for the install of an inline filter (if manufacturer isn't going to supply it)

Pro tip:

If you find the bidet-proper wash's (""bottom,"" setting) velocity to be too high, sting, or needle you, even on its lowest setting, including the auto or oscillate- try the ""ladies'/front,"" wash setting and position the nozzle however you like. I feel the volume of water on that setting is higher, the spray pattern maybe a little wider, but the velocity a happy medium, almost to max - with no downgrade to cleaning power.

Ditto if you'd like a bit of a wider cleaning pattern, but ""bottom,"" on auto or oscillate isn't satisfactory to you."
"We have been using this kind of bidet for a long time. This one has everything you need to take care of your business. There are other brands that do work well but lack some very important features.
I’d do a video but……….. just no. 😁"
"As this item is rounded, it makes central opening much smaller and because of this not too convenient for man."
We went back and forth with moving into the bidet world but we are sure glad we did. Took a few times to get used to it but what a difference now. This particular unit was easy to install and works great. It is a game changer for cleanliness and TP savings.
"UPDATE 2
***
Company finally got back to me with email steps to try.
The fix worked and is functioning properly.
Do like the cleanliness of a bidet, but not sure I should have spent $700. Probably could have gotten cheaper one that did the same basic functions.
******THIS IS AN UPDATE TO MY ORIGINAL REVIEW****
After only exactly 60 days from my purchase, the seat sensor does not work properly. If the sensor doesn't work, the bidet does not function. After an hour with Amazon, they are of no use. They do not stand behind the items they sell, and want to charge me over $100 in restocking fees for an item they are NOT going to restock, as the item is INFERIOR. I paid $700 for this item! I tried contacting the seller and called their number. I was within their operating hours, but I got a message that said they were closed and to press 2 to leave a message. No such luck. Could not leave a message.
My advice is to buy high-ticket items locally so that you have some recourse if the item does not work. A lot of good a 3 year warranty does when no one stands behind the item that was sold.
Bottom line, I changed my rating from 5 to one star, and would give it less if I could. This is based on the product quality and the follow-up (more like lack of) that I have so far received for this item.

I just got my Bio Bidet and was anxious to install it. I'm pretty much 'plumbing challenged' so I had my worries that this would be a difficult installation. Quite to the contrary, I had my bidet up and running in less than 30 minutes. The instructions were pretty clear, but I suggest you read them over once or twice and get familiar with the parts included. Installation was a snap. A ""10"" for installation.
Next, I tested the features using the remote control. Again, quite easy to understand and set up. Remember you have to be sitting on the seat for the bidet to function. A ""10"" for the ease of using and setting up the remote.
Lastly, I tested most of the functions. So far, I am delighted at the wash, dry, air freshening aspect of the bidet. There are many choices for washing and drying, so be sure to check out each one. Remember that you don't have to wait until the function finishes - you can stop any function at any time. A ""10"" for bidet functions to this point. I'm looking forward to adjusting and refining the cleaning options.
I don't know why I waited so long to get a bidet. I was introduced to them when I traveled to Asia and was curious about them in the USA. They leave you much cleaner and will really cut down on the toilet paper usage, which is an issue with people like me who have septic tanks.
All I can say is that I'm extremely happy with my purchase. Another hint I will give you. I purchased some cord holders from Amazon and had a few left, so I used them when installing the bidet system. You can hardly see them in the picture, which is the idea. Great way to keep all your cords organized and free from getting caught while cleaning, etc.
I will leave you with a song (to the tune of 'Sitting on the Dock of the Bay')
""SITTING ON MY BIO BIDET, WATCHING THE CLOUDS ROLL AWAY...

I will post updates as needed. Dan"
My bride purchased this product after great review from our son. We recently went away for a week and she was lost without it! Great product - Easy to install - Easy to use!
"I rarely take the time to review anything, but I must say this Bidet is awesome! I wanted to wait and see what I really thought about it after owning it now for nearly 3 years. The features and the reliability of this product are truly superb. My entire family in the home literally fights over this bathroom, because they want to get the premium butt wash that it offers. I literally have just 2 more months before the warranty expires. I am sad to report that the unit has malfunctioned on the heating element responsible for warming the water that comes out to do the cleaning. It's winter and the chill is real now. Contacting customer support to test the final piece of the puzzle to give the final review. A product can be wonderful but if the service and support is lousy then they lose me for life as a customer. I am counting on them standing behind their product. I will come back again with results I get as soon as I hear back from them on the resolution."
great product!!! love it better than the TOTO
This has exactly what I was looking for. I had a cold water bidet before. This is definitely so much better!
"I like everything about this product, it works great, the options are wonderful, its comfortable and we plan to buy a 2nd one"
Great pressure and water temp. Works well! Highly recommend.
"First off, I don’t hate this bidet-seat, BUT will make some points that may or may not be positive. After 2 plus weeks of “testing”, I can offer the following in the way of thoughts and experiences in using this bidet-seat.
Here goes: Initial impression is that it is of decent quality. I noticed some reviews made comment regarding the seat being weak or of poor quality. IMHO, NO, …I have had the chance to use it, and can state without question that it is a solid product in this regard. Anyone who “falls” on to a toilet seat, well they might, by way of sheer force, break ANY toilet seat after several “Drops” of body weight onto a given seat. Clearly, ANY product meant to hold the weight of an individual sitting down, would struggle to build-in sufficient strength for those who insist on DROPPING their arse(s) down on to a seat.
Moving on:
We purchased this bidet to do TWO (actually, one thing(s)), things right? Cleansing and Heated Water. And so: Heated Water? Um, NO… This seat provides heated water, but ONLY after it douses you with COLD water for several seconds. In short, expect to have your back-side “surprised” with COLD water for about 5 or 10 seconds before it warms up. After that, yes it seems to hold temps for about 2 minutes, after which it loses some warming power, but does not revert to being cold.

For those with IBS, or Hemorrhoids:
If you have a sensitive “Rose Bud”, you may encounter some discomfort from the stream that is used to wash your back-side. The intensity of the stream is by no-means hard but certainly it might feel that way if you suffer from external Hemorrhoids.

The REMOTE CONTROL:
The remote control is a joke at-first. It will take you a bit of time to understand the way in which the manufacturer designed it. For example, the Heated Seat button sits right in the middle of the Up and Down arrows. You’d assume the arrows control the heat volume of the seat but NO, the arrows control something separately, hence the water pressure, Up stronger, Down, weaker. The Heated Seat button is simply pressed several times to cycle through the heat settings.
Also, the water Temperature is controlled by a center placed “thermometer”, and on each side of it, are + and - buttons. Once again one would think the plus/minus buttons are there to change the water temperature. But NO, once again the geniuses who designed the remote, made those buttons control how far the water “wand” travels, hence to control distance of the sprayer, …as to your personal anatomy.
There is an Oscillation setting which makes the wand move forward and backward to create a moving stream (for better cleaning I guess), but it SHOULD oscillate side to side IMHO, NOT forward and backward. Useless.

The Remote offers 3 different streams from a single wand…
Normal Bidet Stream, Lady Specific Stream, which allows the wand to travel farther for spraying a woman’s anatomy, and finally the “Enema” stream for those who want to fill their rectum with water thus promoting a movement. I have not used the “Enema” stream FYI.

The Seat has a built in deodorizer, but I am not sure if it’s all that effective for reducing odors. I guess it helps a bit? That said, it’s a “throw-in” feature that frankly one could do without.

Overall this is a good bidet / toilet seat, but I feel it could be much better, particularly related to the Remote and how confusing it is to use at first. Like most-anything, eventually you can use it with confidence.

Take-Aways: Remember the following important facts about THIS seat: 1. COLD water comes out for several seconds before warming up. 2. The Remote is hard to figure out at-first. 3. Those with IBS and/or a sensitive back-side might find the spray (even at its lowest setting) a bit uncomfortable. 4. Auto Mode. (Spray then Dry) is pretty useless as it only runs water for 30 seconds. I will admit to not reading up on whether the time can be adjusted for the AUTO setting. But, I don’t think so…. BTW, the seat comes with a “Blow Dryer”…. My impression? USELESS."
"We now have a bidet in all four of our bathrooms, so I've had a chance to experiment with a few brands over the past few years as we added each new bidet. We only just recently installed this unit, the BIO BIDET BLISS BB2000 as our last one. I thought I'd try this product due to some advertised features that mainly turned out NOT to be an improvement. There are ALSO some drawbacks to this bidet.

Before I go further, I'll note a product that you SHOULD buy instead of this one. It's a much better bidet than this one, it costs $200 less, has all the same features, is easier to use, the remote is more intuitive, and it does what it advertises: Your better choice bidet is the ALPHA JX Elongated Bidet Toilet Seat. It's a much easier to use product, performs better than the one I'm reviewing here, and is much less expensive. https://www.amazon.com/dp/B015GC6SAC?ref=ppx_yo2_dt_b_product_details&th=1

Now here's why I recommend that one over the one I'm reviewing here:
The pro's for this unit (the Bio Bidet Bliss BB2000) that I thought might be worth the extra bucks were these:
1. It has a stainless steel (instead of aluminum) spout.
2. It offered (but did not fulfill exactly) an adjustable feminine wash setting (there's a setting, but the water lands in the exact same place as the other setting), and
3. It looks a little sleeker with the stainless steel on the top back when the seat is closed.
But do these advertised benefits make it $200 better? Not at all. It's not even as good as the other, less expensive, more intuitive-to-use product I just mentioned.
The cons for this unit have mainly to do with the remote and the instructions, but first, let me reiterate that the feminine wash setting is a joke. A separate place on the stainless steel tube squirts a low volume of water and there is no way to get it to wash from the front unless you perform gyrations on the seat. The ALPHA JX Elongated Bidet Toilet Seat has a better feminine wash than this unit.

As for the other cons I mentioned:
1. The instruction booklet tells you what buttons to use on the remote to adjust the spray for the feminine (or any) setting, but those buttons don't exist on the remote! When I emailed customer service about this, they did respond promptly and told me they were sorry about the errors in the instruction book and to use other buttons that ARE on the remote, but they did not perform the function they should have effectively, so that was a waste of time (and the extra $200 I spent precisely to get this feature). When I complained about the added cost for poorer performance, customer service said they were sorry I didn't like their bidet.
2. The remote has a clock on it you have to set! Why? If you need to know the precise time when you're in the restroom, surely you can look at a watch. This clock and the time setting buttons take up precious space on the remote, not to mention add an annoying series of programming steps you have to do in setup and then re-perform each battery change, daylight savings time change, etc.
3. Also, there is a STOP button right in the upper left corner of the remote, your first intuitive target to begin the wash. It's not a start button, which is where you should place one, but rather a stop one. And it stops EVERYTHING. Consider that you would have had to search out and find the buttons to start anything before you could stop it and you'll understand why the placement of this button is pretty non-intuitive.
4. To add to the consternation, the graphics on the remote button are pretty hard to ""get."" If these were traffic signs, we'd all be in wrecks constantly.
5. To add to the STOP, TIME, and CLOCK SETTING buttons, there is a button that says ""SAVE."" Now, we live in a computerized digital world, and one would thing SAVE would mean ""save the settings I just laboriously entered: the seat temperature, the water temperature, the position and force of the water jet (to the extent you can set it), etc."" Nope!
My husband and I kept creating settings and then hitting SAVE only to have all our settings wiped out and find a cold seat and cold water when we used the bidet next time. It turns out ""SAVE"" means ""save energy."" Not very intuitive. The better product I mentioned above, the ALPHA JX Elongated Bidet Toilet Seat has a button that says ""ECO"" for that. I got the meaning immediately and never once hit a cold seat or got surprised by cold water because there was a confusing button on its remote.
6. Finally, there is no ONE button for a quick wash and dry. You have to program the remote every time for each separate function. Every single time. The better product I recommended, the ALPHA JX Elongated Bidet Toilet Seat has a quick wash and dry setting that (once you set water temperature and position of jet ONE TIME) is always ready to go and you don't waste any time punching a dozen buttons on its remote.

This bidet is not worth the extra money. It would not even be worth the same amount as the ALPHA JX Elongated Bidet Toilet Seat, because it is inferior to that product. So buy the less expensive/better one and get a MUCH better product, have more money in your pocket, a better performance from your bidet, and less consternation!"
"The unit works great and wife loves it. Installation was a little tricky because their instructions have you install the mounting piece backward and we broke the piece because of that. Called the company and they sent a new piece and admitted their instructions were flawed. Minus that, works great."
"Great, but too loud."
Works great easy to keep clean. You become addicted to using a bidet and wonder why you waited so long to get one.
Great product with every feature you could want and some you haven’t thought of!
"i had no idea how much i would like this. its a game changer. this model in particular, has a more intense mode for better cleaning. its now a hands free operation! that changes my entire outlook on this matter.

its not just a matter of being cleaner.... but to have warm water doing ALL the dirty work.

was very simple to install. should have done this years ago. but, i dont think the old models were as good as this. totally clean! its hard to ever want to use any other toilet. well worth the money."
"I bought this because a friend of mine already owns one, and I’ve used it, and I love it! Along with just being amazing the installation was so easy I literally completed it start to finish in under five minutes."
"Yes, like you may have read, a bidet seat is a great addition to your toliet. It's not a ""life changer"" like people say, but it's a nice luxury for cleaning up. Here's the down-low:

PROS:
- Customizable spray temp, position, and power is very nice. I keep it on warm and 4/5 power for standard use. Then after those spicy meals to be gentler, making the water cool and lower power is just the tender touch you need for recovery.
- The seat warmer is fun I guess. I've never really had a problem with cold toliet seats though... it's not like we're in the age of outhouses anymore?
- Having a remote mounted on wall is very convienent. Much better than the controls on the side by your thighs with the cheaper options.
- The blue light is nice, but it's always on, so meh.
- It's the seat itself is heavy duty enough for my 260 lb gorilla rump to sit on indefinitely, and at least for me, it doesn't ""stick""

NEUTRAL:
- The ""dryer"" is the main reason I wanted a more expensive ""seat"", besides hot water. But it comes from the back right under the seat and isn't angled too well. Don't expect it to be a dyson airblade. It has a 3 minute timer, and that's as long as it will take WHILE you are moving around to angle it to get everything. If you have time to kill and want an excuse to be on the toliet, it works.
- The ""deodorizer"" doesn't seem to do much? I mean it's a fun thing to mention when I brag bout how advanced my toilet is to friends and family, but there's been times when even this can't overcome the real stinkers
- Lots of options, little difference. I can't speak for female crowd, but the enima nozzle doesn't seem to be much different? Also there's a lot of buttons, so you might need to explain how it works to first timers and guests...

CONS:
- The GFCI outlet has tripped multiple times. And every time is when I'm not using it, so it's not due to the seat 's power during use. There was a review here about some electro-radiation or something, I wouldn't doubt that there's something funky going on here. Maybe it's just my outlet or the extension cord, but I doubt it.
- The spray is just a jet stream. Maybe that's what you want, but for me I wish there was a more spread spray that just hits everything, you know? I hate dancing around trying to get everywhere on my bottom that might be hit with collateral damage.
- The lid isn't ""sittable"". It's just a real thin plastic convex shape. Why? I'm paying $500 dollars, why can't you add a little more tougher plastic, or god forbid, porcelain, to make it sittable?

I don't regret buying it. It's a solid option if you don't want a new toilet or you're renting... but maybe at some point, if you got the cash, just go the full monty and get an entire smart toilet instead? It's not perfect so 4 out of 5. If you don't mind what I've written, go for it."
"I love this product. However, within about a year the seat no longer heats. Trying to call support team is IMPOSSIBLE. I am going to buy another brand. Please read the other reviews too. Someone said there was a problem with the (electromagnetic fields) which can create a health problem."
This unit is amazing. It does it all from warm water to a warm drying breeze.
"I came across these bidets when I visited Japan years ago and finally owned one when I bought my home a few years ago and it came with it. 5 years later and it gave up the ghost. Once you get used to a bidet, it's hard to be without one and especially during the great toilet paper shortage during Covid. No issue when you have a bidet. This version is a more modern and improved version I had. You need to get one and you'll wonder how you lived all these years without one. Get it, you won't regret it."
Fairly easy to install. I had to run a new electrical outlet and that took half a day but the bidet lid only took about 15-20 minutes. Very happy with the operation and boy is my ass clean now! Highly recommend.
This was very easy to install and has been a great addition to our remodeled bathroom. the number one feature to me is the heated seat.
"Works very well, attractive and like the hand held remote."
Nothing I can add that others haven't already said... except if you're on the fence GO FOR IT! You will not be sorry. It's worth every penny.
Very well made! And a must have for every home. Not sure how I have lived without a heated toilet seat for so long long!
Very nice for the price
"The functions are great and the remote includes everything useful.
Installation was very easy.
I have two minor issues to mention.
1. The remote uses tape to attach to the wall, allowing for screw mount in addition would be better.
2. The hinges for the seat and cover are not together, this means the seat and cover slide against each other as they are lifted or closed. I have installed two other bidet seats and they have the seat and cover hinges together so this sliding does not occur. I consider that a better design, but perhaps not a deal breaker."
"Pro:

Installing was super simple and straightforward. Took me about 30 minutes total to removed the old seat and installing the new one. Love that I comes with everything needed for the installation. I like the fact that you can adjust the water pressure and the heated functions works great. It also comes with a lot of features. As far as the sprayer, you will want to your bottom around to get a nice clean.

Con:

What I didn't really like much is the seat sort of position you a little too forward, what I mean by this is when you sit your genital is basically touching the edge of the seat. I literally have to lean forward to let it drop down so it doesn't touch. Women don't have to worry about this. I'm 5'8 165lbs and the seat fits me pretty good, it's not great but good. That being said, I definitely do not think this will work on the big folks. Lastly, the dryer is ok. You really have to sit for a good 3 minutes for it to completely dry you. I use it to dry a little and use TP to clean the rest.

Overall, I gave it a 4 stars. Will come back in a few months to update"
The features are numerous but the results are even better. The instructions are very clear and the manual is well written. I would highly recommend this product.
So comfy and works great! Wish I’d bought this ages ago.
"OK - this is a first day, pick up on Treasure truck, installed, adjusted.
So what does this mean? Well this is an initial review - unboxing, installation, and initial use (how easy, or difficult?).

First of all, I have been considering a bidet option for quite some time. In all honesty, BioBidet was not on my view list, just had not heard of it. The treasure truck offer, some quick research show that people who have purchased generally felt this was an execellent device.

People love unboxing videos - well I didn't do, one; and they tend to be rather silly.
The product was well packaged, in functional packaging - no paying for a fancy box; I'm perfectly fine with that!

First thing I did was read the directions, like to do that - weird, I know.
You should be generally very happy, they are thoroughly descriptive, with pictures and diagrams were needed.
Some of the pictograms could be a bit larger - but at least they are there, and readable.
The English is actually pretty good - we have all suffered through the horrible instruction manual.

Installation:
1. all necessary parts and pieces include - all hoses, connectors that you should need.
2. Couple of minor critical (maybe) comments:
A. 2 water hose connectors included - replacement for your existing, and water source to seat tank.
a - the main supply hose included an adapter of 1/2"" to 1/4"" reducer. However mine did not attach (too small).
b - I resolved the issue by reusing my old hose connector.
B. This does require power, and is 120v. Which is fine for me, I have an electrical duplex above my toilet.
a - as you might expect, water inlet and power are separated. In this case, opposite sides of the seat separate the two inlets. While this is safe, in my case the cord is about 2"" short of feeding under the tank. It plugs in, but the cord is tilted in the socket. I have plenty cord, if I run over the top, and behind the seat. It works, but looks real hack - will need to install another outlet, or a short extension. Neither is optimal, when 6"" or 12"" of more cord would do the trick.
i - my suggestion is to change the design to be a plug in power cord (like computer) and offer several lengths. At the price point for this unit, it is feasible.

Adjustment - If it is not obvious, and it wasn't to me (splurge purchase) this seated is heated (adjustable), has heated water (adjustable), and a fan for drying your tuckus (adjustable heat). The remote has a fair amount of control (buttons with symbols). things may hit you as obvious, but I think I will keep a copy (page 11) - handy for guidance until it is ingrained in my brain.

First use - I was very pleased, the water temp, seat temp, and air drying temp are quite functional, and do improve the experience.

there are a few features, you may enjoy, but probably not meant for me - massage ( I will let your imagination work on that). Not sure of the purpose, but we all might guess.

If my experience changes after reasonable use, I will offer an update. Happy p**ping!"
This is our second one and love it. Also bought one for my niece for christmas.
"Must have in every master bathroom. Great quality, very comfortable, a lot of settings.

For company only two things to improve is:

1. Night light lit only from left side as many other brands do it from inside ball

2. Remote control do not lit in the dark and it’s not a problem after a week of use but from beginning it little uncomfortable and for this price it must be"
"This is my first experience with using a bidet. My wife was interested and I was curious. It has many adjustments to make the process as enjoyable as possible. And I must say, to my surprise, it’s quite comfortable and gets the job done."
"So, first and foremost, this bidet does its primary job of cleaning up 'down there' very well, no complaints about that.

For reference, we had three BioBidet BB-1000 seats, and the oldest one (3 years) started acting up. We like the cleaning of the BB-1000 but it had some minor issues so we figured we'd upgrade to the BB-2000 when replacing it.

Except the BB-2000 isn't really much of an upgrade. There are some pluses, such as continuous warm water, versus the 'tank' concept on the BB-1000 which meant if you used it all up you got hit with a cold shot of pipe-temperature water.

HOWEVER, that 'continuous' stream of warm water in the BB-2000 comes at the cost of much lower pressure/flow of water. The BB-1000 would literally blast the (blank) out of you on the highest settings. This new BB-2000 will only gently wash you down there, no 'blasting', even on the highest settings. It still does a good job of cleaning, but sometimes you just want to nuke the site from orbit just to be sure, and you can't with the BB-2000.

Continuing the negatives on the BB-2000, it does come with a fancy new LED screen remote, however there is zero lighting on the remote. Not backlighting. Not indicator lights. Nothing. The remote for the BB-1000 was more crude, but it also had nice, bright, shiny indicator lights for everything. The BB-2000 does have a 'night light' feature but the light is below your right hip shining directly downwards on the floor, and not enough light gets up around my fat-ass to light up the remote screen to make it usable.

It's like BioBidet just can't get the details right, at least on the models we've tried. Again, both the BB-1000 and this model the BB-2000 do an excellent job of cleaning 'down there', however they both have convenience features that have glaring deficiencies, particularly for the price."
"We got our first one, we have always been curious about getting the bidet. I did a lot of research and we decided on this brand and style. The warm water and seat is super convenient. We are happy with our purchase and would recommend it to others."
"Bought the bidet for my mom. Just installed and mom tested it. So far, so good. She liked it and passed the training how to use. She needed this training since she will be 90-years soon. Even she is not an IT gig, she passed the training successfully. Let' see the product performance through years of use."
ease of use
"I'm pleased with this product, easy to install, and have a perfet fit. Product is as advertised, comfortable and use friendly."
"First I want to say one thing. The remote could be better, it needs a direct line of sight. I could not figure out why it was working for everyone else besides me. I thought I was doing something wrong. Sometimes it would work and sometimes it would not. Finally, I was like this is come bs and I might need to return it. Put the remote in my right hand and it started working perfectly. I am a big guy and I guess I blocked the line of sight LOL.
NOW that is out of the way. I have lived 40 years and never used a Bidet in my life. This was life-changing. After work, I of course want to come home and see my kids and finance. But as soon as that was done, I wanted to go and relax on my heated throne and forget about my day. Never did I think spraying my Butt with water would be so pleasing and relaxing part of my day. I take the full 2 minutes of the spray and then take another 2 or 3 minutes with the heated fan to dry my freshly cleaned hiney. I am sad to get up and continue with my day. Maybe if I am lucky I might have a round 2 by the end of the night. Sorry if this is too much info... BUT This really is the best thing I have ever bought as an adult. I thought I was going to have a hard time justifying the price of this product. WRONG I would buy this thing 10 times over and I have recommended it to several of my friends. This has changed their lives as well. There could be small improvements but it doesn't matter I love it. The thing that surprised me is the heated seat. I myself do not like heat. I could live in Alaska and wear shorts all day long and be happy. But the heated seat surprised me. I enjoy it. I like how you can adjust all of the settings. Be careful with the strong setting. It will clean you out. On that note. Enjoy. I sure am!"
Had it now for few months. Works well.
"MinBB2000 is still under full 3- year warranty, but I cannot get in touch w/ anyone to help me w/ a problem. If you know how, please LMK"
"This is a very nice bidet and the very first my wife and I have installed (with the help of a handyman).
It uses 1400 watts of power and with that and the GCFI switch required, our contractor highly recommended it's own 20 amp circuit breaker which obviously added to price of installation. Have to be careful lifting the lid as it sort of pops on the left side hinge if pushed all the way back. It's plastic so be cautious and never sit on the top of the seat! Thus, the 4 star rating."
I love this product. Easy install. I have already begun less tp backups.
"With toilet paper costing high prices I decided to switch to a Bio Bidet Bliss BB2000 Elongated White Smart Toilet Seat. I was worried about the water temperature, but it's consistently warm and comfortable. The seat installation was easy, but I needed to run an outlet to the toilet location.

One note though: the upper picture on page 15 is incorrect; the catch plate is backwards. The tab which they have next to the stool opening should be on the side away from the opening, otherwise the Bio Bidet Bliss BB2000 Elongated White Smart Toilet Seat won't latch.

We are very pleased with the unit, the dryer works well and does a good job."
"I have been wanting a bidet forever and had done my research for quite some time before purchasing from BioBidet. I wanted something that wouldn’t be a nightmare to install, wouldn’t completely break the bank and which would offer all of the amenities that I want. BioBidet as a company came well recommended to me by a friend, and WOW, I am not disappointed. Installation was only difficult because this was my first time doing anything with a toilet. But objectively speaking, it is super easy once you get the seat installed. The features are lovely and make you feel like you are receiving a spa treatment. No kidding! MIND = BLOWN! You won’t want to even touch toilet paper once you have this in your bathroom!"
"WOW! What a great product. Built well, installation straightforward, and easy setup. Remote documentation could use improvement but has no functional impact. Remote setup is more than likely a one time setup and then every setting you need and want are set and operations become a 1 button push. The water stream, temperature of water is fantastic, and the oscillating feature is just incredible.
I had frustration over years of feeling clean and being clean and this is going to be a life changing addition to my bodily care routine. I would recommend to anyone suffering with getting and feeling clean. Looking forward to years of bliss.
Only potential drawback is the time you spend in the bathroom. It is so soothing, and the warm air dry off is icing on the cake. Time well spent!!!!"
"After using many bidet’s in Asia on a trip abroad this summer, I was determined to select one for our home. This model emerged with the features I was looking for and has not disappointed. Only feature we wish was for the lid to be able to sit on - it will not support weight. Not a big deal but would be nice. Easy to install, easy to use."
Easy to install after I looked the directions up online the ones that came with it weren’t as accurate
"Very easy to install as long as you have a receptacle close enough to power it. I was a little reluctant to spend the money on this but my wife really wanted one and this had good reviews so I got it. My wife absolutely loves it and I have started to become a fan. Installation was easy, slightly more more work than a regular seat but not much. This model has a lot of functions which is nice but it does make the remote a little crowded but easy to use once you are familiar with it,"
"The bidet functions as it should but I am disappointed in the flimsy lid. I have a very small bathroom and need to use the toilet with lid down as a seating area for dressing, etc. Installation was very easy with the assistance of a video I found on line. Unfortunately I cannot link it here. It was You Tube: How to Install the Bio Bidet 2000 toilet seat. I did not find any written instructions with the bidet I received so the video was vital."
"Play Video
 I had another bidet and I changed for a bioBidet. It’s beautiful and the work it does, is amazing.
Thank you!"
"I've been leery of bidet's forever. My motivation for the BioBidet BB2000 purchase, is an upcoming surgical procedure that would limit my ability to effectively wipe my posterior, and no..., nobody is going to do it for me. So, after a short discussion with my wife, it was a done deal. I do admit that it took me a month to gather up the courage to install the unit in our master bathroom, but on the first day of December, I got 'er done.

Installation was breeze, and I carefully followed the provided directions. The documentation was well written and easy to follow, and BioBidet furnishes most everything to make it happen. I did need to do some electrical manipulation, since the 4 foot cord came a bit short of the wall socket, but no big deal.

On that anxious first day of use, I drew the short straw, so I manned up to the BB2000 to take it on it's maiden voyage. I grabbed the remote, pushed the vortex wash button and held on for the initial stream of water. I almost hit the ceiling initially, since I wasn't expecting that sensation, but within seconds all became good. I went through the remainder of the cleansing and drying steps and then did a thorough quality evaluation of my posterior...it needed a slight TP dry, but the BB2000 passed with flying colors.

All kidding aside, the more we used it the easier it became to use. This is a fantastic product and we highly recommend it.

Please take note that before you purchase this, or any other unit, take measurements of your toilet to make sure it will fit. Consult the manufactures web site to research the dimensions that are required for a proper installation.

BioBidet, you did good! We are very impressed; so much so, we may outfit another bathroom with one ."
Do not use the supplies brand line. Didn't realize till after a few days. It had a slow leak. I replaced with the old line and it works fine. Now.
"Overall this is a great product. The best part they don't explain too much in the manual is the Turbo Wash function is actually sort of a mini-enema / colonic. IF You get everything positioned just right the Turbo jet is strong enough to actually rinse out INSIDE your body - it's almost like this seat will poop FOR you. For those of us with nerve damage and constipation this feature is a godsend. Great stuff!

Improvements needed:

1. At least on the unit we got, there isn't any way to adjust the timer settings for each cleaning function. For instance I want 4 to 5 minutes on turbo wash, this thing is stuck at 2 minutes.

2. You can't use the seat to sit on or put your foot on to dry after getting out of the shower. Really disappointed in that. Very very flimsy, cheap lid. For $700 you'd expect a lid that is usable.

3. The rim has an unsanitary seam running all around the inside edge - it can catch flakes of fecal material and is hard to sanitize clean.

4. Wife reports Feminine Wash function doesn't get anywhere near to wear it would do a lot of good, she is an average size person about 5' 4"".

5. Night lite is way too bright. It only has an ON / OFF function. Why can't we have OFF / Din / Low / Medium / High settings? It would be easy to do on microcontroller.

6. Haven't seen the drying fan function work all that well, although it is heated air. Still need a little paper to dry off after a cleaning cycle.

7. Needs finer controls for front to back positioning, and I want to see a ""wiggle"" function for front to back motion, just like it does side to side. That would be another software fix.

8. The nozzle design needs improvement - Again it has slots and seams that can collect poop, and it needs to be easier to clean.

9. The lid mounting system isn't great. Even with the hold down bolts tightened the lid mount bracket can still slide on the porcelain. It feels a little rickety no matter what.

10. The manual is sort of OK, but it could be better written, especially by a good native English writer.

11. Not made in USA. Built in Korea, this is much much better than the knock-offs coming out of China."
"6+ years later - I was initially kind of ""meh"" about this, but after 6 years ours finally died (the seat cracked) and we will definitely be replacing it with the same model. We have had to replace a part or two over the years (the ""ears"" where the toilet seat attaches are pretty fragile). But, overall, this bidet is one of the few things in life that now costs less than it did when I first bought it, so that is a plus.

Improvements I'd like to see: a less fragile seat, in terms of being able to sit on it when the lid is down and a seat lid that doesn't crack or break the attachment points, as this has twice now, and a seat that is better attached so it doesn't give side-to-side quite so much.

OLD: The first one of these I have ever had, so I have no other reference - sure I have used ""built-in"" bidets in Europe, which were more basic than this but seemed to work well. Lol, writing this review feels like a TMI of exposition-length, but this is a big purchase.

Installation - very simple, took maybe 7 minutes max. We did already have an outlet within the cord length distance. Came with all the parts we needed.

Pros:
- Warm water feels good
- Does get some of the cleaning done, cutting down on toilet paper use and potential irritation.

Neutral:
- It is fairly noisy, but it is in our master bath away from other living areas
- Does seem to, paradoxically, lengthen the whole process, between the wash and dry cycle

Cons:
- From a cleaning standpoint, doesn't completely replace toilet paper, which is what I had hoped.
- Requires a lot of sliding around on the seat to get the nozzles to hit just right. The ""wider area"" button needs to actually cover a much wider area.
- I am a tall woman and the feminine wash is not adequate without sliding up the seat so far that it feels a tad like pole dancing.
- Drying fan, while it can get uncomfortably hot if aimed wrong, doesn't actually dry - or maybe I am just too impatient to sit there that long.
- Even ""gentlest"" setting can aggravate hemorrhoids and make them bleed (ie: the spouse does NOT like this device).

In sum - I expected it would work better for us than it presently is. At half the price it would have been a good deal for what it does, at the price listed here it seems a little much for something that only partly works. Maybe my expectations were too high, I expected that it would completely replace toilet paper and it hasn't.

Not sure if we don't have the lid tightened down far enough or if it is just from the squirming required to get the water to hit the right places, but we constantly have to adjust the alignment of the seat and the toilet.

Other notes - the ""nightlight"" is FAR too bright and we ended up using the ""secret"" remote codes to turn it off completely (it was mentioned in another review here - on the remote press the square STOP button and the temp button at the same time)"
"The warm air dryer on this model is one of the reasons I went for this particular model. However, it doesn't get you dry -- even after letting it run for the full three minutes. You end up having to dry yourself another way, so we don't bother with using the dryer at all any more. We liked the seat warmer at first, but even at the lowest heat setting, it started causing a burning, chafed feeling on my skin, so we have stopped using that as well. As others have noted, the remote doesn't light up, so you can't see what you're doing during the night unless you turn on a light or memorize where the buttons are. On the positive side, I didn't expect the deodorizer to be very effective, but it is. Also, we do like the night light, and the fact that the wash can last up to a full 2 minutes with the water staying warm for the whole time."
"So far so good with the bio bidet 2000. It was easy to install, but I had a bit of trouble understanding the remote. Once you identify the correct settings, everything is fine."
"Play Video
 It does clean very good just the nozzle position doesn't adjuste as I expected, but If you move your butt behind of the seat than you will get everything cleaned very well! I like it! The warm seat is very comfortable and you can also adjust the temp of the seat and water. The air dries only one side of the bidet, another side I still need to dry with a little peace of toilette paper. But for this small unit it does the mostly of the work!"
"UPDATE: The manufacturer helped me out and there is a way to disable the beep sounds - press the Stop and Massage buttons at the same time. Fantastic! Solved my problem - I'm happy, wife is happy, dogs are happy! Upgraded to five stars.

Original Review:
My problem with this seat is one design flaw that makes it unusable for me - it beeps when you press any of the control buttons and there is no way to disable the beep sound. This is a problem for me because we have dogs and use an invisible fence on our property. The fence collars beep when they get too close to the line so my dogs have associated any beeping sound with the fence shocking them. My one dog hears a beep and goes into a bellow-barking rage and the other goes into a panic trying to claw her way up your body to safety. I see in the questions/answers section that there is no way to disable the beeping. I guess I have to return it and try to find one (like our old Brondell model) that does not beep. I know, a first-world problem, but it means no using the toilet in the middle of the night or else you wake everyone up. A shame as it seems like a nice unit otherwise - if only the sound could be disabled."
"This unit has way too much pressure for me, even on lowest setting. Remote is dark and difficult to use, no backlight. I’m gonna try the Swash 1400. Hopefully it has less pressure, and the remote looks a lot more user friendly to me."
Works perfect thanks Bio Bidet!!!
Does everything the advertisement says.
"Unfortunately it seems the BB 600 is no longer available so we bought the BB 2000 Bliss. It's OK, but install isn't as easy as the 600 and it doesn't clean as well as the 600."
"This thing changed my life. A fair warning though, it will ruin you for normal toilets. I initially bought one for my house. Once I was hooked on it I bought one for my office.

I even went as far as buying one for temporary use. We had guests staying in our home for a month so I bought another one to put in the bathroom in our bedroom since I couldn't use the original one we bought. And that was only going to be an issue for 1 month.

I'm going to my brother's house in Texas for Christmas and I'm buying one to send there for him to install. I said I will buy it if you install it and I get to use it when I am there.

So, ya, I love this thing.

I recommend mounting the remote on the wall though, otherwise you don't really have a good place to put it all the time. You can still take it out of the mount, it's not permanently attached to the wall, but I have it within reach so I never have to remove it.

Be warned, the pressure is INTENSE! People think these can't possibly get you fully clean. WRONG! The ""vortex"" mode is more like an enema, literally that's what they say. However, you can adjust the pressure. You can also adjust the temperature of the seat and the water. The top setting is too hot for me.

Pros:

You will never feel more clean after going to the bathroom.
Powerful pressure, easy to use.
Tons of features.
Multiple settings for pressure, temp, etc.
Settings for men and women (front and back basically)

Cons:

You will be ruined for normal toilets for the rest of your life. But it's a good thing in my opinion. I have no idea how I went 40+ years without one of these."
"In an effort to cut my environmental footprint I'd been thinking about a bidet for a while... then that pesky pandemic kicked in, morons hoarded all the toilet paper, and I thought, ""Now's my chance!"" You know who was worried about TP? Not me. I had looked at a few models, and ended up with the Biobidet as it was a nice combination of features and price, and nobody had anything nasty to say about build quality or materials. I do have some complaints: The remote is silly. It's gigantic, the buttons are labeled in silly ways, and it's an ergonomic mess. I think this thing would do well with a motion sensor or a photosensor or even a timer, as the heated seat it on or off.... it's wasting electricity 23.5 hours a day otherwise. Well, I don't know your life... but I'm not using the toilet more than a 30 minutes a day... maybe if you have IBS or something you have less electrical waste. Either way. BUT, the major features of this thing are great - the heated seat *is* wonderful, the water functions and temperature are bloody close to exactly right, and the remote is workable. Installation was quick & utterly painless. I still use a little TP but hardly any.... I haven't bought any in more than a year. Maybe it's in my head, but the ads aren't wrong... there is definitely a better feeling using water versus paper. Now I'm faced with the problem of *really* not wanting to use toilets outside the house. I'll tell you, it's weird the seat cost twice as much as the toilet, but NO RAGRETS on this purchase. Or my speeling."
"This Bidet came with everything needed to install and have a great addition to our personal bathroom. Every feature of this is great. We love the heated seat and heated water function. The temperature levels are adjustable for comfort. The water pressure and spray are adjustable and the Bidet remembers the settings, which makes it so nice. Install was easy. Would buy this again. A+"
"Easy install, (although if the toilet is in a tight space it could be difficult to make the water connection.) Seat works well, all settings have a wide range of adjustment, both pressure and temperature."
"Play Video
 Now that I have had a few days to use this product, I absolutely love this product and all of its features. Installation was a breeze. From heated seats to warm air dryer to auto open and close, this product is amazing. It’s as good as the best of the best. I have other Bio Bidet’s in my house but this is the only automatic one. You won’t be disappointed."
"Extremely satisfied with this luxurious, high end product.....Superb functionality, easy to operate, Customer support 👏 beyond satisfaction!!!
Plus.......just few minutes away from our home....located in Crystal Lake, Illinois.
Very soon will purchase another one, exactly the same...
THANK YOU VERY MUCH BIOBIDET COMPANY!!!
Sincerely,
Elena"
"I admit I was a bit hesitant seeing ratings in the low 4s, but I honestly don’t know how you could give this anything other than five stars. It’s NOT difficult to install at all, I’m a complete dingbat when it comes to household handy work and i found it fairly simple. The features are amazing and it’s exceeded my expectations. Now I want my parents to get one so I don’t have to use toilet paper when I visit them. I kept my eye on this product for over a year debating whether or not it would be worth it, and now I wish I had made the switch much sooner. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!"
"This thing is pretty great. I installed it myself and I am not good at that stuff. Works well, though the nozzle doesn’t move forward quite enough so the front wash misses the mark. The remote though……why on earth put the open/close lid button in that terrible spot?! You’re constantly closing the lid on your back."
"This bidet is great for a man only. It if you’re a woman, the FRONT WASH setting does NOT reach your front section (even when you adjust it to the furthest front setting it has). What a waste of time, money & effort. If you’re a woman and want to wash your front parts, you will have to physically move your body all around in order to do so, and the probability of splashing water and/or contaminating other things is HIGH in my wife’s opinion. Needless to say, husbands - if your wife is going to be mad at you for spending this much money on a bidet that won’t adjust to wash your wife’s front parts, don’t buy it! Waste of money & not worth an angry wife, like mine. The heated seat option is nice though."
"This Bidet is awesome ! Had a prior one w not as many features. This one rocks!! So many bells and whistles and adjustments for the pressure and temperature and spray location !!! LOVE the seat also, so sturdy and comfortable and of course heated is my fav !!! Also the auto seat and lid opening feature is excellent and the nightlight!!! Also LOVE the blower feature w 3 strengths so much better for a woman 🌸 don’t hesitate plus a 5 year warranty"
"I just bought this Biobidet seat and let me tell you ,i dont know what took me so long to buy it.
this seat is absolutely incledible and wonderful.
It look really nice and makes the toilet look elegant.
what a great product for the price., Love it."
Absolutely love the Bio Bidet Discovery. Tons of high end features. ! Only thing missing is the Vortex that I have on the 2000 series but that is made up for with many other options.
Life changer
"Purchased this for our grown son and his wife. They love it! They have an earlier version of this bidet, but we got the one that has the seat that raises automatically for their new master bathroom."
84 yr old Mom was extremely happy with this.
I am loving the heated seat and remote control options!
"Play Video
 After reviewing various websites. It was between toto c5, bb2000, and the dls. The uv sanitation and auto seat open is what made the decision for me.
The heated seat and constant warm water is as advertised. Dryer function seems to work well but don't usually use it.
The install was done myself and took about 1 hour. Would have been quicker but my toilet float valve became stuck..nothing to do with bidet.
Overall, everything is cleaner and quicker process than wiping. Even my kids like it!"
"For the longest time, I just went with the TP status quo out of habit, without thinking too much of it. I visited a place that had a bidet by a different manufacturer, and it piqued my interest. After some research, I landed on this bidet, which checked all of the boxes I was looking for. Elongated, sleek look, warming seat, and the claim that it was easy to install on your own. I'm far from a handyman, but I can confirm, very doable for the average joe.

It's great, really. This is a great product, don't overthink it."
I have both the DLS and BB200 and I think the DLS is superior. The water pressure on the BB is stronger but can be too much. The fan is better on the DLS and I like the auto open/close feature.
"I purchased DLS BioBidet during summer months. I wanted to wait a few months before writing my review. I am very impressed with DLS BioBidet, it’s functionality is outstanding. Several of family members & friends are going to purchase one.

Excellent Product."
"We purchased this bidet in preparation for two shoulder surgeries. My wife was skeptical and did not want to try the bidet. I love it and feel so much cleaner and confident that it solves the ""problem"" after the upcoming surgeries. My wife finally tried it, and she now loves it as well. In her words ""so much better than the Charmin my hinny is clean"". Highly recommend this bidet!!"
"i was looking for bidet that will have all function
this one have it all"
Did a lot of research prior to purchasing this and super happy with all the features. Definitely going to get a second one for the other bathroom!
"Was looking for a Japanese style bidet as I just returned from Japan.
This looked good: but the bum vs overall wash are no different, poorly positioned, and arrows don’t seem to work on position customization. So nothing like the Japanese bidets which of course are set up well
FYI the customer service number does not work at all. Never rings through and you cannot leave a message. They ask you to email them. I did. Asked them to call. 9 days later I got an email telling me to use the arrow to adjust the position. Of course this doesn’t work.
Not happy with this at all. There are other bidets out there with working temperature controlled that don’t cost $600."
I love the bidet. It works as described. The plus is the dryer. Best I’ve tried yet. The only issue I have with it is there is no deodorization. That is the main reason why I use these. I’m going back to my old Toto.
Spent 1 hour and 85 dollars buying brass parts at homedepot to figure out a method to get this installed. We have a 60 house with 3/8 compression fittings coming out of the wall not uncommon. None of the parts work for that plumbing setup.
"I have used several bidet’s over the years both in the USA and abroad and literally NOTHING compares to the Discovery DLS BioBidet. Between the warm water, dryer air and seat warming that you can adjust the temperature on, the automatic open and close lid and seat, the ease of installation, the ultraviolet sanitizing that occurs after every use, the adjustable nozzle position, and on and on and on, there is nothing bad that I could say about this bidet. Worth Every Penny!!"
"I've been traveling to Japan for many years and always come back to primitive America, where the average home, including mine, still uses toilet paper. I finally decided to bite the bullet and buy a bidet for a relatively new toilet. I did a lot of research and It appears it paid off. This is a fantastic product. Every feature works as well or better than expected. Apparently the dryer on many brands is insufficient. Not so on this one. It was very easy to install. I had one minor question and immediately spoke to someone at BioBidet who had an answer. It took about 30 minutes total. This was quite a bit more expensive than many on the market but well justified, perhaps. I could not be happier with this purchase."
"Really easy to install, work great. Easy to use remote.
The only bad thing is that I spend more time in bathroom now :-)"
"I got Discovery DLS unit because of the auto open/close function, and it was on sale during Thanksgiving.

For such an expensive model, the functionality of every feature leaves a room to be desired.

Worst: Dryer. When you turn up the temperature for warm air, instead of blowing warm air, the deeper end of the seat gets overheated without heating the air, to the point that it felt dangerous to keep sitting on it. It forced me to get in a habit of sitting forward, which isn’t hygienic because water would splash onto the seat while cleaning.

There is no programmable profiles for different family members. Are we all supposed to like the same setting?

Auto-setting seems to think I need to be washed forever, and ever. I’ve never had enough patience for it to bring it dryer automatically (after minutes of wash mode).

Double-sided remote controller makes it easy to press wrong stuff.

Beeps are annoying. Why does my toilet seat need to beep so loud for every little click? Who thought that was a good idea?

Overall, it has right features on paper, but poorly executed. It’s still cheaper than other brands’ models that have auto open/close, so we might keep it for it because I need the function, but I definitely don’t like it as a bidet."
I would definitely highly recommend this bidet toilet seat.
"Great for back disability,Auto Wash"
"The installation was a breeze. I was finished in less than 15 minutes. One suggestion during install is to place the seat on the toilet as I needed to move it forward when I just used the template.

One you get this installed you’ll realize how amazing it is to have a bidet. Talk about luxury. Never worry about are you clean enough. This will take care of you and leave you feeling refreshed."
"Disappointed in the bidets high failure rate. 3 out of 4 malfunctioned within 6 months. When sitting on the seat they would freeze nozzle rinse and stop functioning. From then on they'd repeatedly beep twice and flash. Restarting sometimes works temporarily, but the issue always returns. Support keeps asking unhelpful questions like ""Are you sure it isn't working 100% of the time?"" and ""Are you sure you're making skin contact?"". After too many emails we eventually got them on the phone and they only agreed to replace 1 unit (with us on the hook for shipping) while they inspect the others, leaving 2 toilets seatless. We'll see if the replacement works. Never buying this brand again."
"UPDATE:
Unfortunately I have to change my review for this bidet. Only 4 months in it has already stopped working and had to be sent back for repair. I paid almost $800; for this bidet and would expect better. Then they make the customer pay shipping to send it back. It cost $40 to ship it. The customer should not have to pay to send in a defective product under warranty. It is a nice seat when it works but based on this experience I would advise you look for a different brand and confirm they provide all expenses for repair should it be needed. Your choice!

I have purchased and used many bidet seats. They were all non powered. I decided to upgrade and I am so happy I finally did with this particular seat. The auto open close is awesome. Especially if fido think the toilet is a water bowl. Love the adjustable settings. Buy this today. You won't regret it."
No more tp!
I really love the product! Don't know why I waited to by one. Best invention ever.
"Why did I wait so long to get one of these? What can I say, it works perfectly, The water/seat/ air temperature are all super warm and comforting. The pressure is more than sufficient; I dont need to run it with the maximum pressure. The automatic sensor that opens the lid is so convenient. I just stayed at a hotel with a TOTO toilet and functionally this was just as good as that one. I love everything about this seat."
"Really happy with this bidet seat, one of the best choices I made in renovating my bathroom."
"I've had a BB-1000 for 9 years and it's comfortable as any seat, full-featured, but lacking night light and Auto-Open-Close. I bought this DLS for a second bathroom and after sitting on it for 10 seconds, I was so uncomfortable, I decided to forego the auto lid + seat (which is actually a pain in the butt too) and returned it two days later when my new BB-2000 arrived. That's as comfortable as the BB-1000 and has a night light, and unlimited warm water, but the BB-1000 is better, faster, stronger. So, I ordered a BB-1000 to replace the BB-2000. What a waste of time!!!

TLDR; Don't buy the DLS or the BB-2000!!! Get a BB-1000."
"This item exceeded expectations so far, it has only been a month but we enjoy this set up much more than a traditional American set up. This brings a little vacation luxury to the home and I definitely recommend it."
I haven't wiped my own butt for weeks; this is the future! My toilet is now a cozy rejuvenating palace of relaxation; I will never be without a bidet from this day forward.
We really like our new bidet. I love the warranty and the bidet is great.
Too small area for sitting; the electricity is not compatible with the bathroom
The tee that came with the seat leaks. Support is nonexistent. Fo not buy from this company.
"We bought the seat, and 5 months later needed repairing; customer service took forever to help us with the issue; after 5 weeks, we got the seat back, and the remote didn't pair with the toilet seat, took 2 weeks to receive a new remote. Now the fixture that eliminated the beeping sound at opening and closing doesn't work anymore. So that means that every time you will hear two beeps forever, in the middle of the night, waiting up your spouse. It TO NOISE"
Everything was fine for 10 months and then the water heater started to malfunction. For repair you have the pay shipping and cleaning. It's a very expensive bidet for such poor support.
1st of all the cleaner does not extend out far enough. 2nd of all even though I set my seat temperature to cold whenever I turn it on it is heated.
"After carrying out all of my research of toilet seats, this certainly is the best one that is out there. The features, the ease of installation and the enjoyment of use certainly set it apart from any competitor. I definitely recommend it and would say there's no reason to look else where!"
"First I was hesitant on purchasing one but saving toilet paper seemed like a good idea, you know to save the planet or whatnot. But after 2 weeks of use, I can't believe I waited this long to get one. If you are a cursed like me and are a frequent guest to the toilet then you will love yourself for finally getting one while simultaneously kicking your ass for waiting this long. Saving many trees since my toilet paper consumption has been reduced by 90% give or take. Heated seat is nice and the pressure is perfect for me at maximum but above all, Auto rising seat is where its at, especially at night time when you are trying urinate in zombie state. Also coming out of the bathroom feeling clean as a whistle is always a bonus."
"Installing the bidet was a breeze, and it has been working great so far. I really enjoy the heated seat feature. All the control options on the remote are also very handy. Great experience!"
"I have gone back and forth on my rating for this company. I am rating it a 5 but there are issues I believe potential customers should be aware of. First, the product is great - see my original comments below. If you need customer support they do not answer the phone. If you send them an email asking for help, they will help you but DO NOT SENT MULTIPLE emails. If you do their computer system puts you back at the end of the line. If you need customer support, this company will help you but it takes time. The best way to contact customer support is to go to their web site and start a chat. ALSO, save your original box that the bidet came in. If you have problems while the bidet is under warrantee having the original box will save you money when you have to pack up the bidet for repair. Below is my original evaluation.

The BioBidet Discovery DLS elongated bidet seat is loaded with features and appears to be well built. It works as advertised. The pros, as advertised, you can adjust the water and seat temp, UV cleaning, nightlight, adjustable water pressure, etc. Although I can not think of a feature it is missing, I rated this seat 4-stars because I am used to using a seat that is about and inch longer than the DLS seat. That may not seem much but for me it makes a difference in comfort."
"I actually really like this bidet compared to another that I had. The nob makes it really easy to control, it is very easy to install and hits great. My only dislikes is the nob is sensitive very sensitive and the off is a very soft click that if not put in the exact spot will leak water in the bowl."
"I will have to admit to being pleasantly surprised by this Bio Bidet Slim Zero seat. At around $90 I wasn't expecting too much, but my 8 year old Luxe bidet had cracked badly, and if you've come to use a bidet, you don't want to be without one! I recently retired and $250 bidet seats were not in my budget, so this looked better than the $100 Kohler to me - less ... bulky.
The seat at first looks ... well, kinda cheap. But as I started to install it, I saw just how well made it is. Of course most of the construction is plastic so it seems very light weight. The installation is a breeze - great instructions, components THAT FIT, and a logical design. The appearance of the opening looked very small to me, but that was compared to my original Delta toilet seat. When I did sit down, I was amazed at how comfortable and solid it felt!
The front and rear positioned jets take a little adjusting of your posterior to get that great match, but after a while I felt like my old Luxe friend was back, but better - everything is one piece!
The pressure is very adequate - I can't believe you can remove the restrictor to get MORE pressure!!! Space Launch!!!
The removeable feature for cleaning is practical and appreciated - very easy.
My only complaint is the position of the pressure handle. You get used to it just fine while seated, but when you're wiping down a toilet, it is very easy to jog the nozzle and spray water all over. I've learned to be careful while cleaning.
One other mention of the handle; the middle position, or off, is not a very positive ""click"" type feeling, and sometimes it takes a little finagling to hit the center ""off"" position.
Overall I am very satisfied with this Bio Bidet Slim Zero bidet seat. Keep the great products coming!!"
"The Bemis Bio Bidet is a lot like the superlative American Standard bidet (elongated only, sadly) but with brass components. We don't care about the gimmicky nightlight, just the quality, and so far the Bemis is a keeper. We added a T-valve cut off. Otherwise, it was a by-the-book standard easy install. Be sure to hand tighten or barely tighten with channel locks. People seem determined to wrench away and overtighten all these bidet products, then are surprised when leaks sprout around the plastic fittings.

Suggested but not required: Even after years and years of variant DIY home plumbing projects, I still use a thin strip of thread tape on most connections. Just peace of mind. I also wait 24 hours before declaring victory, putting down under the fitting(s) a hand towel and a couple of paper towels in order to absorb and see any potential leaks."
"This is our first experience with a bidet so I don’t have anything to compare it to. It takes some getting used too, but seems to work well. I did a lot of research before purchasing because I didn’t want to spend a ton of money, but didn’t want a piece of crap either. I almost bought a version that wasn’t a toilet seat, it just goes under your existing seat until I saw lots of people mention that those type don’t work with certain toilet seats. That it raises the seat and leaves a big gap you need to use spacers to fill and then it looks stupid or angles weird. Since this one included the seat it fits nicely and no ugly gaps. It also has a brass fitting instead of the plastic many of them come with. As a first time bidet user I was a little concerned about the water temp since this is not heated at all, but it’s been totally fine. Overall very happy with the purchase. As someone with ulcerative colitis I should have gotten a bidet a long time ago."
"First off, why haven't I gotten a bidet much sooner? So much cleaner to use than toilet paper!

I was a bit worried about the water temperature since it is whatever the temp is in the water line, but quickly found out that's not much of an issue. It feels fine to me, perhaps if you live in a further northern climate where water temperatures are much cooler, then it could be of concern.

The bad, the water control for turning the water on/off vs for the front/back is a bit finicky, if you don't get it back exactly to the mid position, it can continue dripping water until you notice it and specifically get it back to the exact mid position. There really should be a little wider range in the middle for the water to be off so that it does not drip and waste water. Also, if you have an elongated toilet seat, this kind of limits the elongated section a bit too. These are the only negatives I've noticed, but with water being fairly expensive in my area, a dripping bidet can add up to a significant water bill, so I'll probably replace with another bidet that has better on/off of the water control.

Hmm, I bought this as a black friday deal in 2023 for $99, now after writing a review, I see it is now priced at $79, and 10% off. Here's your black friday deal, we'll up the price and list it for more and then put it back to normal later!"
"I had high hopes for this product, but it turned out to be a big disappointment. First big problem: The seat is not stable, it slides around on the toilet no matter how tight the mounting screws are tightened. That is a deal breaker for me right there. Then the spray tubes are too close to the bottom of the seat. Maybe my butt cheeks hang below the seat, but when the rear wash tube extends it hits my right butt cheek and therefore does not spray the desired area. It just splashes the water off the cheek and does no good at cleaning the target. I tried shifting my sitting position so that I was facing about the 11:00 position, that got the spray to hit the target area but it was not particularly comfortable sitting like that. And that water lever design is a joke. It sticks up in the air, it's way too easy to accidentally activate the spray with the seat lid open then water sprays out of the toilet onto the floor and wall. The water lever doesn't have a definite well defined off position. If you don't get it exactly vertical, water will continue to dribble out of the nozzles like a constant water leak. Due to the nature of the product, after using it I'm sure it's not really returnable even though Prime stuff usually is. So for me this purchase was a $100 waste of money, I guess I'll just have to deal with it. I'm really glad I didn't fall for trying one of the $400 models first."
"I installed it myself, very easy. It fit my toilet perfectly, the spray action is excellent. I also love the blue light at night."
"I have used this bidet for several weeks now as of this review. There are simply too many things about it that are weak or poorly designed/manufactured that prevent me from giving it a high rating.

Pros:
1 - Easy installation. It installed easily for me. One small leak was remedied by tightening the connection 1/4 turn more.
2 - Item has brass fittings and valves that should last for a long time before leaking. Other bidets from other manufacturers seem to all use plastic parts, basically making them all throwaway toilet seats after several months of use. I cant speak for other people, but I'm used to having my toilet seat last for years, if not decades, before I need to replace it.
3 - Seat and cover soft drop nicely.

Cons:
1 - Water pressure is way way way too strong. I was forced to carefully enlarge each tiny hole in the sprayer arms by drilling the tiny holes larger. Spray is softer now and, at least, bearable. If you live in an area with extremely low water pressure in your pipes, you may be ok, but otherwise, be prepared to be literally pressure washed when you use this item. Seriously.
2 - The seat is manufactured/designed too cheaply given the price tag of this item. Its comfortable to sit on, but the thin plastic gives it a cheap commercial-thin feel, like going in a public or office bathroom. Its just plain cheap looking...
3 - Night light is not either motion activated, or light sensitive. It is on, or off, using a manual switch/button. My bad for not researching this before buying the item, but nevertheless, this is a surprisingly arcane and cheap way to design a nightlight. I can get a $1 dollar store nightlight that is light sensitive... Sigh.
4 - Wash is ok, but I feel the spray heads should be lower when they come out, allowing the water to spray out more. The spray seems too pinpointed. I need to move around to get it right. Also, the difference between the feminine wash and the butt wash are negligible.
5 - The seat moves. I've had to retighten the screws several times. The seat seems to be more secure now, but the tightness of the screws against the cheap plastic concerns me. I dont expect the thin plastic plate that the seat mounts on will last very long before it cracks and makes the seat useless.

Overall, there are just too many little annoying things about this bidet. I can deal with all of them, but for the price tag of $115-$125 bucks, I expect a little more quality and better product design. This should be a $60 item, no more. You've been warned."
"My husband and I installed the bidet in 1 hour and 45 minutes and no reason to go to the hardware store for additional products. This bidet went into our extra bathroom so we elected to go non-electric. Therefore the water is not heated but we live in AZ and our water is rarely really cold. Besides the cold water could be a shot of “hello, wake-up!” The bidet appears to clean very well and you definitely need some TP to dry yourself! The bidet is quiet and appears to be made with quality material. Happy with the reasonable priced tush washer!"
"Install is not to hard if you have done some DIY plumbing before.
I got both a standard and elongated seat pictures are from the enlongated/
The Bidet supply line leaked from the location pointed with the red arrow.
The T-valve also leaked when used with a plastic water tank hookup.
no amount of tape stopped the leaks. =(
It was lucky that I was replacing an existing Bidet so I ended up reused that hardware.
The old bidet had arms that would no longer retract.
If you are buying this you should expect those 2 parts to maybe leak. Both of my seats included leaking hardware.
Lets hope this seat will last more then 5 years and out live the old one."
pressure is good
"Love it. I bought the bidet incorporated into a seat to bypass having to buy stick on risers to attach to the bottom of the seat to level it out. Well the seat still is not level. We are skinny people but the plastic seat still bends when sitting on it. I've removed it and checked the bolted attachment and it is tight, it's the seat. I was never so excited to drop a deuce. Fabulous! No further concern if something was left behind. It automatically cleans itself before and after too. The water pressure is not too high for me. With a push of a button the seat can be removed for cleaning. You push a button on the side to turn on the night light. It stays on for 7 hours and has 2 settings, high and low. We bought the seat for a new Glacier bay oval toilet. Someone complained the opening in the seat is smaller. I measured it on our toilet, it's 1/2 inch smaller. My husband didn't have a problem with it. Look carefully at the measurements. Some of the measurements on Amazon are PACKAGE measurements. Look for the diagram of the item measurements. I got confused until I found the diagrams of the measurements. The small knob on the side is perfect. Less surface area to get splashed on. Come on people! Have an adventure in the bathroom!"
"Absolutely nothing to dislike. It works as a feature so easy to install. I am 80 years old and I installed it without any problems cleans well it is easy to clean and comfortable to sit on love the lighting fixture that turns the lights off after seven hours, so I don’t have to remember to turn it off before I go to bed. If you haven’t ever had a bidet boy are you missing out?"
"We have used a Brondell bidet toilet seat for a while. We loved it so much we decided to install one in our other bathroom. When shopping I found this unit and thought the LED nightlights were neat so we bought it instead.

Well, I have now bought a Brondell unit to replace this one.

It functions ok, but….

The water lever protrudes upward so you will bump it accidentally while cleaning etc… makes for a funny story but no one wants to get wet like this. It will literally shoot water across the entire room.

The other issue is the stream is too harsh. Our Brondell unit has a much nicer stream for your sensitive areas

Go with the Brondell and you’ll be happier."
"Before u install go buy a rubber gasket for T valve adapter. Otherwise IT LEAKS!! One is not even shown in instructions, that it’s needed."
"I gave this product three stars even though I sent it back. Here's why: the seat fit well, everything was in the box as expected, the connections all fit and were leak free, BUT the metal 90 degree elbow on the toilet seat end of the hose would not seal and allowed a slow water leak between the elbow and the collar it goes through. I wanted to love this product but was quite disappointed. I know I could have requested a replacement hose and I know it doesn't take very long to install but I just resent having to uninstall it, reinstall the old seat then later uninstall the old again and reinstall the new again. They should pay you for your time if the product is to blame. Is this just another example of the common occurrences of installing third world manufactured parts and products. Quite possibly. Bring back USA and first world country manufacturing again. I pay a fair amount more and be happy it. I hope this helps you determine if the purchase is worth the risk."
There is nothing cheap in the parts and the design. This is a well crafted bidet. I have read in some reviews where it leaks. I discovered the reason by not putting in the rubber gasket between the T-connector and the toilet. There is no mention of it in the directions but after the initial installation I noticed and extra rubber gasket. I disconnected the t-fitting and added the rubber gasket. No more leaks. I give this bidet a 5 star and would recommend it to my friends.
"We bought two of these to replace an older BioBidet attachment that we purchased through Costco several years ago. This was a definite upgrade with a much smaller footprint for the controls. It was easy to install, and we love the little nightlight, and the slow closing seat and lid. The other feature that I really like is the push button seat detachment for cleaning. We would buy these again."
"This is the only non-electric bidet I have found that is wide enough in the back to cover the washlet hole on a Toto toilet.
Very easy to install, the only problem I have is that with the Carolina II Toto toilet there is almost 1/4 inch of space between the seat and the toilet (the seat will not go all the way down to the toilet) I guess I will have to install some thicker rubber feet under the seat.
Another thing, which is not bad, but could use some improvement, is that the handle to turn the water on and off does not have a stop to know when it is on or off."
"Installed it last night. Quick and easy. A plumber is definitely NOT required however you should have some DIY skills, especially with plumbing connections. I suspect that the people who experienced leaks lack the proper skills, and it's completely the fault of the installer, not the fitting. The instructions could be a bit more detailed but that's why I mention having some DIY skills because the lack of instructions didn't hamper my install.

With respect to the product itself, WOW I can't believe I've been ridin dirty for so long! My daughters swore they would not use it, but as of today they are fans, and I just ordered two more (one for their bathroom and a guest bath). The cold water is not an issue AT ALL and I live in CO. Our toilet paper consumption is about to drop substantially. I'm thinking we'll be switching to individual washable baby towels to dry off.

If you're on the fence, I would tell you to give it a try. This model has a soft-close seat & lid, night light and a brass valve system (vs plastic). Normally $129.99 but $90 right now."
"The bidet seat seems easy enough to install, but the T fitting that connects the toilet hose to the bidet and toilet body is complete garbage. The fitting threads don’t exactly match up to the threads on the flush valve, which resulted in a cross thread that can only be fixed by getting a whole new flush assembly from the hardware store. No amount of Teflon tape or pipe dope stops this thing from slowly dripping either. I have 30+ plumbing projects under my belt - I’d suggest tossing the T fitting that comes with this unit and getting a plumber grade fitting from the hardware store. Or better yet skip it entirely, it’s not worth the headache.

UPDATE
After fixing the cross threading issue (which may have admittedly been due to both the fitting and the plastic water connection on the toilet), we have used this bidet seat for over a year with no leaks or issues. This unit has much more ""horsepower"" than the Tushy and does a better job cleaning overall. Upping my review accordingly."
"I was able to install this bidet by myself and without any problems. All I needed were the instructions, the parts, and my own screwdriver and wrench. It took about 1 hour but at least 1/3 of that was trying to get the connections tight enough. My bathroom is very small so it took some time to reach and correctly tighten everything. The instructions are really wonderful.. They are very clear, go step by step and tell you everything you need to know. My only critique is that it would be nice if the images of the parts were a little larger. If it helps, I am a 69 year old lady with no knowledge of plumbing."
"We got this for our guest bath. It does what it should, looks reasonable, but the handle and pressure are two significant flaws. The handle while attractive fooled our first couple of guests who thought it was the flush, one accidentally pressed it even after a warning. We now remove the handle before someone comes over. The pressure selection is basically useless, the first click is nearly full power, you need to slowly taper before the click if you don't want an enema. As others mention the Off position isn't very stable. It does take careful adjusting to ensure it's truly off, and is very easy to bump. Beyond that the lid feels flimsy and cheap, and the seat doesn't like to stay in place, needs to be secured extremely tight."
"I had a bidet attachment installed under the toilet seat in my son’s bathroom, and it go so dirty under there after a couple years that I couldn’t clean away the smell without taking it apart to clean and then the toilet seat didn’t want to attach very well again!

So I finally purchased a new one and was excited to find this all-in-one toilet seat and bidet!

It was so easy to install, and I love the expanding bulb design for the attachments so liquid can’t escape from the bolts under the seat and cause a mess under the toilet when little boys don’t aim very well.

I love that I have easy access to all parts of my toilet to clean it, and I can easily remove the toilet seat to clean under it without having to remove the bolts, but even if I wanted to they are super easy to remove, as well, and I don’t have to try to reach under the toilet to unscrew a bolt.

I only just installed it, so I will come back later to update in a few weeks after use, but so far I’m happy with my purchase."
"I spent 1.5 hours trying to install this without it leaking. I ended up replacing the pump valve in my tank, but it turned out the T-adapter provided was the cause of the leak and no matter how much I tightened it, it never went away. Ended up returning the item unfortunately."
"We had these professionally installed on each 9f our 3 toilets last June. From the start, the toilet seats slid around or shifted when you sat down. We never got any light to work. The soft close broke on the most frequently used toilet after about a month. There was no difference between the two bidet functions, but they worked so one star earned each. We used these for a year before we could replace them. These look cheap, are very easy to turn on accidentally, and are not at all worth the money. Go shop at the Tushy page instead."
"Makes your elongated toilet seat way smaller. Also, water control and flow is not steady or consistent and tends to have a mind of its own for some reason. This was easy to install in my opinion, however."
"I had this installed for me. The lever is ridiculous. I wanted to love this. We could only tolerate the lowest settings.. I mean this thing is like a power wash.. don't accidentally bump it higher. Why even have srttings that will inflict pain or damage to sensitive areas? I wish they had different controls. Initially it was very difficult to get a stream of water to stop and even a bump would set it off. I thought well.. its ok. We can be careful and balance it out. Now after 2 days it's impossible. It's continuous. I can't have someone remove it for me until mid week so all I can think of is the jump our water bill is going to have.

My package was delayed by a couple of days so it's possible mistreatment jarred and damaged it somehow. It had no extra padding and was shipped in the regular bio bidet product box.

If the stream were fixed I'd still be weary if there are children or pets. You could have an incredible mess. Or an injured little bump.

I will be returning as soon as possible. Shipping caused issue or not, this is costing me lot more in water use/loss than the tp would have."
"Was easy to install, looks nice and sturdy. The water valve started out soft but if not careful comes out hard. Perhaps my water pressure is too high. It would be nice if the water was able to be heated. Cold water on the tush is quite the wake-up call"
"I previously had a bio bidet slim glow. I bought a house and I wanted to get a bidet that was the whole seat rather than the add-on using the existing seat.
Fit is much better than the add-on style. Mounts tight and there is no movement (I used the steel screws with the rubber anchors). No problem installing and no leaks. Soft drop seat is nice feature to have. Pressure is quite strong but less than the slim glow I previously had.
The light isn't really that useful to me I put batteries in one of the seats just to try but you have to manually turn on/off so I just took them out, might be useful if it was automatic with lid lift or motion or something."
For the price you cant beat it. Powerful yet comfortable. Easy to use switch that control two different settings. Soft-clost seat and lid. Has a really cool blue light feature which is great for middle of the night toilet use. Its battery powered which is fantastic because no need to connect to an outlet. And the best thing of all to me its easy to install and has peaces to support standard toilet to your much higher-end toilets that covered on the sides making access to the bolts of the toilet seat impossible. This really made a huge difference and made a lot more sense once I watched the Youtube instructional guide. You wont use every single piece or part that this product comes with. Hope this review helps and shows that Biobidet is a clear hands down awesome choice.
"This slim bio bidet works great! It was easy to install and once connected up, easy to use. We liked this bidet so much that we purchased and installed 3 total for our bathrooms. The soft closing of the lid works great. The night light was a cool feature that helped our potty trainer to actually want to use the potty! Just be sure to brief any visiting children as they might think it’s the toilet handle and spray themselves…😂"
"Great inexpensive bidet seat! I already have an electric Kohler bidet seat for our master bathroom (there is a nearby GFI outlet) and have been looking for a decent bidet for two other bathrooms in our house that have no access to electricity. I like that it has features from the Kohler version (soft close seat/lid and nightlight), so I bought this one and another one from a different brand that seemed almost exact, but slightly cheaper. After seeing both together, I realized the cheaper one was not a good color match for our toilets and there was no night light, as advertised. We installed the BioBidet SlimZero in one bathroom, returned the cheaper version, and got another BioBidet SlimZero. Yes, the water is a bit cool (I’m used to the heated seat/water from my Kohler), but it’s not a big deal. Great bidet overall! Less toilet paper, less mess!"
"It shoots a bit forward, so you'll have to sit up or scoot up a bit.
Convenient if you don't have a nearby outlet for warm water, but that cold spray is rough."
"Didn't know if I would like this but I LOVE this! You will feel so much cleaner, as if you just had a shower! Never knew I needed this until I tried it. One star deducted because it fits perfect on one toilet, and a tad too long for the other, so the lid won't stay up which is quite annoying. Be sure to measure first if this is a concern for you. Otherwise, great product!"
"I thought this complete bidet plus seat would appear much more OEM, and not as temporary as a lot of the other add on bidets that go on an existing seat.
Unfortunately this feels just as lackluster and less than ideal. It’s mildly better as far as presentation but the actual fit is still not great. A gap between seat to bowel, movement no mater how tight the bolts.

On the positive side no leaks whatsoever.

On the negative side, the valve position so prominent...invites an accidental turn/bump during cleaning, more so than the flat dial of cheaper units. I wiped the seat to clean and got hit in the glasses with water.
This was purchased as a Corona TP emergency backup and for that I’m content. I gather the Toto will be a more legit unit for those seeking long term bidet options that don’t look jury rigged as far as guests are concerned."
"Works as advertised and I'm happy with the purchase. A few thing to keep in mind: 1.) Installation will most likely require additional tightening of the plumbing fittings with a wrench. 2.) Insure that all sealing washers are installed in the correct direction. This will help seal leaks mentioned in other reviews. 3.) By nature of the design, seat real estate is lost. You'll be moved forward and seating area is smaller. This is because of the housing in that back that encloses the nozzles and control valve. This wasn't a real concern for me, but something to be aware of."
"The install was very easy. I like the slow closing feature. I like the overall appearance, and the night light is very cool. What I don't like is that even though the seat is specifically for an elongated bowl toilet, the back end of the product extends over the back end of the actual toilet bowl so much that the actual opening of the seat is not a full length elongated seat. For example, our current seat provides a 12 inch front to back opening. This seat ends up at only 11 inches. I'm not trying to brag, but I don't like my apparatus touching the front edge of the seat...that's why I like elongated bowl toilets. This seat defeats the purpose. I guess I'll be returning it."
"Excellent. Received quickly. All parts packed well. Super easy to install and has a metal water connection, not the plastic that can strip easily. With a screw drive and adjustable wrench, it took 15 minutes with minimal plumbing knowledge. NO ELECTRICAL CONNECTION. Works flawless and so much better and sanitary than toilet tissue. WILL save money, especially with the toilet paper shortage forecasted due to COVID.
Very attractive and the lid sets level, which is a big plus. DON'T WAIT!!! It is an excellent upgrade."
"I bought 2 seats, one long one round, the long was not long enough to fit properly. I was out of town when the products arrived so I did not make the return date."
I installed this a couple of weeks ago. All I got was complaints from my family about how the lid wouldn’t shut and how big and bulky it is. The back part of the unit invades about a third of the space of the bowl so the seat hole is much smaller than a regular toilet. It cleaned great though and everything worked as advertised. But the seat being 2/3 the size of a regular seat was a show stopper. I uninstalled it and installed a Betterways unit and am much happier with having a small and simple unit!
I love this Bidet seat! I grew up with a bidet in our home and used it every day! I never had space for a bidet in my bathrooms. My friend has this model and I used it while I visited and had to have it as it worked beautifully just like the bidet from my parent's home. It was easy to install and easy to use.
"I really appreciated the sleek design and didn't find the seat opening too small. Unfortunately the nozzles touched my bottom no mater how I sat on the seat. I am not a big person. So unfortunately it did not work out for me. The merchant was very prompt in processing my refund. Thank you for that!
To anyone thinking about ordering, I would order a t-valve with a plastic hand tightening connecting, save you a lot of frustration and stripping of the threads on your toilet tank inlet."
"As a bidet, the SlimZero is pretty solid. The room temperature water wasn't an issue, but I also live in an area that doesn't exactly get seasons. The water pressure was perfect and the nozzle stream was well-concentrated. Installation was quick and easy, although the rubber washer for the T-joint being a separate part was a bit annoying. The nightlight is nifty but rather useless in my opinion.

As a toilet seat, the SlimZero is pretty abysmal. It's soft close function takes soft to a whole extreme, and, either due to a flaw in how the seat is designed or due to the shape of my toilet's water tank, the lid needs to reach a very specific position to stay open; as soon as I sit, the lid loses that position and gently caresses my back. It also wouldn't firmly lock into its bracket, so the seat's actual position shifts a lot very easily.

I ended up getting rid of the SlimZero and replacing it with a SlimEdge, which meant I could use my perfectly functional original toilet seat, but the SlimEdge is pretty terrible as a bidet. It feels like a completely uncontrolled hose is spraying at me, and it results in a lot of excess splashing all over the place that I have to clean up."
"I'm all about optics - how something looks. This bidet seat attachment is sleek and streamlined so looks great.
Have only been using for a day but so far functioning well and don't know why I didn't upgrade to a full seat attachment months ago. Seat is comfortable and with 2 adjustments for front and back a breeze to operate.

If you haven't taken the next step to personal cleanliness I encourage you to not wait another minute.
This is an inexpensive way for you to clean the nether regions and feel clean and refreshed."
"Happy with my purchase, one feature could have made this a five - recommend the diverter should have an adjustable valve to regulate pressure, vs. Seller's added cost of including two different set of mounting hardware with no explanation of why to use one method vs. the other. Also the installation instructions are not great - it takes a lot to design anything well (and this is), so why cut corners on the customer experience with mediocre install docs? Still satisfied with the product."
"Works great, easy to install if you're patient and careful not to crossbreed any connections. Cool water is actually no issue at all. Learning curve with the little lever so don't A)injure yourself by turning it full blast B) wear waterproof clothes for when you're installing because it is highly likely you will accidentally spray yourself before you learn how easy it is to turn it on"
"The shipment arrived in double-boxed perfect condition, and the instructions were easy to follow. Not being much of a DIY-er, I was worried if I could install this myself. I gave it a shot and followed the steps. After two iterations on finding the right notch to put the screws in, it was a piece of cake to install. Make sure to empty the toilet tank prior to installation and turn off the main water supply. Also, tighten the connections well to ensure there is no leak. The force is very comfortable (not too weak, not too strong), and the bidets do their job!"
"We replaced our previous bidet seat (a different brand) because it developed a leak. I found a video to fix the leak but it was actually for a different model and didn't work. The previous bidet seat wasn't for sale anymore so we chose this one and I'm happy we did!

The hardware is definitely better, with brass fittings and higher water pressure. The first time turning it on was a bit of a surprise, though! We do actually have the previous model from the other brand still in a different bathroom and I prefer this one by far."
"1. Leaked terribly from the t-connection until I gave up on ptfe tape and used plumbers putty - no leaks in almost 2 months of use.
2. Pressure seems extreme, but actually compensates for smaller flow through the small apertures allowing adequate water for cleaning.
3. Valve body at back really shortens the ""usable"" seat area - may cause problems for those with larger seat requirements.
4. Would definitely make purchase again.
4."
"This bidet is very nice, but does have a two drawbacks.

Pros
Functions as intended
Feels well made
Thoughtfully designed (detatch function, installation hardware, seat shape)

Cons
Valve is easily bumped and makes a mess
Valve needs a better defined off position

Take Away
There will be some learning to do for my little ones; but I like it and would recommend it to a friend."
"Due to the nature of this being a universal part and having to fit a wide range of porcelain thrones, if not installed correctly, the seat tends to slip backward or side to side. I used the plastic nut and bolt set the first time I installed it and could never get the seat to stop moving around. Once I switched to the rubber expanding thingy that mounts the bracket to the bowl it solved that problem.

Other than that the bidet does exactly what it's supposed to do. My hiney and my septic field are much happier for it! Bonus: a one finger salute to those toilet paper hoarders I see on Facebook marketplace."
"I had a bio bidet prior but thought I would upgrade. This thing is not that upgrade. I've used it now for a couple of months thinking I would get used to it, but I've given up. Other reviews are correct that the aim on this isn't right. You can't get clean with it. At the risk of being too forthcoming, it seems to aim for your right cheek with extra energy to deflect to the right spot. When I could get clean it was after taking time to position myself very carefully, with non repeatable results. This nozzle has two speeds: not enough to eject the nozzle into place, and pressure washer. My wife won't use it because it hurts, and I can't blame her. I'm outside of my return window, but this is so bad that I think I'll find a different brand for the replacement. I've wasted 80 bucks on this (on sale) and hope no one else does. Protect your hole. Don't buy this. I mean it installed easy enough, and the knob works, but the prime objective is not met. It's poorly engineered. Stay away."
I was very excited about this bidet and it was working just fine for the 1st month then the nozzle started to stuck and doesn't get back in its place after shutting off the water. only options are to press it in using your finger or just leave it sticking out. my expectations were higher for that price point.
"Although this bidet doesn't have all the bells and whistles like some others, it definitely gets the job done. Installation for me was a little bit tricky because I'm not that handy but I still did it with no leaks. There was an extra rubber washer that the instructions didn't specify but I figured out it went into the brass T-valve to connect to the toilet tank. The stream of water takes getting used to but once you do, you'll never go back to plain old TP. This might be a little TMI but the game-changer for me was the front feminine wash."
"Fits elongated toilets perfectly
All the extra functions are great.
Easy to use & install"
"So I purchased this at the beginning of the great 2020 Toilet Paper hoard. I can tell you this I am sure this will save me money in the future as our TP usage has decreased by at least 70%. what a perfect addition to our bathroom. cop your squat, do your business, and wash the nastiness away instead of smearing it all over your bottom end. BioBidet makes sure you have everything you need to install this unit ( except basic hand tools ) so take this review as a win, win from me. save money, get cleaner."
"It was easy to install with minimal adjustments to prevent leakage. The seat is flimsy and uncomfortable. For an elongated seat, it should be much bigger and fit the entire area of the toilet, but sadly it does not. ☹️"
Just received this bidet and it was super easy to install and came with all the necessary hardware. This fit my elongated toilet perfectly. It took me a total oaf 10 minutes to set up. The nightlight is a great feature and I love how you can see it even when the lid is completely closed. The ability of being able to control the strength of the stream is great and also the jet seems to hit the mark every single time. I've tried other brands and decided to make the upgrade to this since it's easier to clean. Would highly recommend.
Para mi toy let la tapa es muy fina
"I have purchased a few of these over the years, this one is not the best. It wiggles around regardless of how tightly mounted, and the knob does not click or self center in the off position. The knob extends above the seat as well meaning that it is all too easy to accidentally turn it on. This happened to a guest who nearly flooded my bathroom. I’d look for a bidet with a better design both as to mounting bracket and on/off controls. As a last straw, the bracket finally broke. Turns out a very flimsy little plastic locking tab is expected to hold the seat on place. I’ll be replacing this with a different offering."
"Bought this during the coronavirus pandemic of 2020. Saw a fight break out in the store over the last pack of toilet tissue. I immediately said ""f*** this"" and bought a Biobidet. So far, it's awesome. You still need toilet paper to dry your a$$, but you'll use far less because there is no need to wipe.

The people on here who complain about leaks probably didn't use teflon tape or tighten the fittings adequately. Mine leaked because it was hand tightened. I put a wrench on it and it was fine."
"Bidet seat was a snap to install - it took all but 15 minutes. what a really like is the battery compartment enabling the retraction of the spray nozzles when not in use. It has a nice chrome unobtrusive handle that turns one the spray - easy to operate: turn handle backwards and it cleans the derriere, turn to the front, and - you guessed it. The seat fits my Kohler elongated toilet beautifully, almost elegantly. As a happy customer, I just bought another one. Lastly let me say that the seat is very comfortable and warm to the touch."
It fits our toto toilets. the spray is strong and you need to get use to the switch so that you don't hit it by mistake and get drenched. Had plumber install and glad that it did. his expertise saved me a lot of time.
Product is not built to last. The led light stopped working and now the seat slams. A little over a year of use...
"Love the sleek design of the Slim Zero. Had a i3000 for about 8 years but the nozzle barb got snapped off by an overzealous cleaner. When I purchased the i3000 years ago the non-electric bidet selection was limited but seems to have expanded significantly. And the simple and sleek design of the Slim Zero is perfect for my application. And what a great price!
Installation was a breeze, and the instruction manual is clear and comprehensive, something of a rarity. My experience with BioBidet products is stellar as I never had a single mechanical problem with the unit in 8 years."
"Great product. Easy to install and it actually works. Only issue is you have to really tighten the bolts because if you wiggle at all[and you will] the bolts loosen. No big deal,you just re tight. Clever and well thought out design. Impressed."
"A great product when electrical plugs are not close to the toilet! So easy to install. Without an electrical connection, the water is not ""temperature controlled "", but this isn't an issue at all for me! The benefits are a lot more important! Easy to adjust both spray pressures and the timed ""bowl light"" is an added plus...especially at night. This bidet is great alternative when electrical hookups are not available. It does the job perfectly. Very satisfied customer with this purchase!"
"From timeliness of receipt, to ease of installation, and effectiveness of use, this product is top notch. After reading other reviews, I was leery of unheated wash water and size of toilet seat. I was not the least uncomfortable with the water temperature. As to the toilet seat size, it is a couple of inches shorter than an elongated bowl seat due to the retractable wash mechanism but I had no problem fitting on the seat."
"Excitement quickly turning to frustration and back pain. Do not buy!

I got this bidet during prime day, it was on sale. I had recently purchased another bidet from this brand and was excited to get one for the second bathroom. I watched the video and read the directions. It looked great and then the leaks started. I thought I just needed to tighten the nuts, and the leaks continued. I went out and purchased sealant tape and...the leaks continued. I thought it might be a supply line issue and I went out and purchased another pipe, and the leaks continued. Finally after days of working on this and back pain from being crouched for so long I gave up. I uninstalled the whole thing. Unfortunately for me for this tightening to get the bidet to stop leaking caused my fill valve to become stripped. Now I have to go out and get another one. This has been a hellish experience, do yourself a favor and stay away from this product."
"This has change my life. We actually used much less toilet paper and get better cleaning. Don't waster your money on the heated water and heat seats which means you have to install electric outlet and hot water lines near your toilet. It really does't make that much difference. This product seems to be well made and durable, time will tell.
The seat seems a little thin but I got use to it quickly but I could give it only three stars of softness. I would buy this product again."
"I should have read the reviews. The water pressure coming out of these nozzles is far too strong. I seriously wondered if I had some medical issues with my rear end using this thing. I used another bidet by this maker for a while and perceived this as an upgrade. It wasn’t, and I’ll replace it soon."
"Pros: cleans you better than another model I used (spray stream seems to be wider)
Aesthetically pleasing, especially with the light at night time

Cons: makes toilet hole where you sit smaller
No adjustable sprayer so you have to move until the spot is right"
"Couldn't be happier with the Bio-Bidet Slim Zero. The video on how to install and what to expect made the whole experience a rewarding one. Not having to call a plumber and having it installed and cleaned up in less than 30 minutes is a plus. The ""washing"" features seem to do the job....just be careful and make sure the turn on valve on the seat lid is straight up when you turn the water back on. Thank you Bio Bidet for a quality product and ease of installation."
"I like the BioBidet name stamped on the toilet, the way it upgraded the look of my second bathroom that was older and did not have a plug nearby the toilet. We bought the BioBidet Slim electric one a year ago and love it so much, had planned to get another one just like it but found we did not have an outlet in the area of the toilet, so went with this one and are very happy with the nightlight, the looks and the ease of use."
A high-quality product that fit perfectly on my toilet. I installed this myself without much difficulty even though I am an amateur plumber at best. I have another bio day product which I am extremely happy with but there was no electrical outlet in this bathroom so I decided on The slim zero - I’m pretty sure by the end of the year all the toilets will in my house have bio bidet systems installed.
This toilet seat/ bidet was so easy to install. I’m a 60+ year old woman and I had no trouble installing it by myself. The video on the website gave step by step video directions that were super easy to follow. Love that it has a night night making it easier to find the toilet in the blackness of night.
"This is one of the best non-electric Toilet seat bidets , fantastic water pressure, adjustable if you need a softer spray. I love the addition of a night light. I have another toilet with an American Standard Bidet seat, I will replace it with this unit. The unit comes with everything you need, unlike my other other unit where I had to run to home depot to get a water adapter. The box and packaging tells you immediately, you have a great product on your hands."
"PROS:
Retractable arms to keep them from getting dirty regularly.

CONS:
- very cheap plastic material.

- Cold water no warmer.

-The handle to “flush” is basically just a bleed valve and does not automatically cut off after a period of time. So must be used just like a faucet not like a flusher.

- there is an off area- not a definitive off position. Meaning you position the handle in between the two wash options. Would rather there be a more secure off position which brings me to the next gripe.

-handle isn’t great, it sort of protrudes up above the seat making it more likely to be moved on accident (animals, children especially.)

-Terrible mounting solution and there are two different anchoring systems though they only give you instructions for the suggested which is ultimately the less likely of the two."
"Extremely easy to use and set up. Went back and forth with the bidet idea and this is just perfect. The seat itself is small, but it’s exactly sized to meet the required aim for front or back streams. Thoroughly happy with the product and the experience. If you haven’t used one, great place to start and does not require a separate water supply. Every blast still catches me off guard and makes me jump."
I like the slim and simple design but the aim is off. The two separate stream nozzle design throws the aim way off to one side. There’s a front and rear. Rear aim is the one that is completely off. Not sure if it is design or product malfunction. Your experience might be different.
"I love the bidet, but the water is cold and you can hurt yourself if the setting is too high. I’ll never go back to a regular toilet again."
Works great. Easy installation. Bought this model for the ability to sit on it and get dressed while closed.
"I don't know why this has good reviews, but this is a total piece of junk. Got it all installed and the elbow (curved connector) that attaches to the seat is leaking, and not where it's threaded. Where the hose connects to the elbow...really, includes water lines but inferior quality? Maddening. There is NO LOCK FOR THE WATER CONTROL! So after install I'm wiping the seat and get sprayed. This is a disaster waiting to happen if you have kids or actually clean your toilet regularly. Plastic is cheap and thin, entire seat shifts slightly when you sit down, and yes the connector is securely fastened to the toilet. Lastly the light...looks cool but it's a simple on or off, two levels. Would make sense if it timed itself off or worked with a dusk to dawn, but not.
Overall, would maybe have been worth $30, but not $100+, and definitely doesn't belong in a house with kids or where kids visit. At least now I know what features to look for. Don't buy this, there's better options."
"I was so excited to try this product, I have never had a bidet before. Maybe I have an incompatible toilet but....the seat lid does not stay up, this is more annoying than you think. And everytime I try to flush, I have to lift the top of the toilet off and jiggle a thingy so that the tank will fill up with water. Should you still decide to try this bidet, trust me when I tell you DO NOT USE AT FULL FORCE. I took a poo and flipped that switch all the way and was disturbingly violated. It never needs to be turned all the up!! I think I may be going back to toilet paper."
"...the outside AND the inside!! Be careful when using it the first couple of times. Maybe it’s just the pressure in my line, but I got more than just a bum wash. I thought I felt my eyes well up w tears but they weren’t tears. Just a little over pressure coming from the bidet. Overall, can’t complain!"
This did not work for us. The valve kept leaking. We tried other T valves from hardware store and also spoke with the hardware guy at the store. We were hoping this to work but it didn’t. End up returning it. The 1/4 thread is not ideal. Getting a different one.
"The BIO Bidet was easy enough to install, although suggestions for alignment of base with basin would have been helpful. The main body of the device can be easily removed and reinstalled onto its catch plate.
The control lever has no affirmative ""off"" position: when vertical water drips into the basin even though water pressure is substantially less than the 110 psi ceiling.
Even when one can use a positive stop (installed a valve), the supply hose leaks where the end of the elbow nearest the hose -- this even though the water pressure here is substantially less than 110 psi.
Finally, nozzle spray's for front of back were not centered in the basin and apparently cannot be dismantled without dismantling the apparatus."
I own one this same model for more than 2 years. My wife liked it so much that she kept on telling me to get another one. When it became available with a reduced price I ordered it immediately. The feature that we like the best is bidet and toilet seat in one. Installing it was a breeze.
"Easy to install and works so well. I can't believe I waited so long to buy. I'm
buying another for my other bathroom!!"
I've remodeled my bath and had a less expensive cold water bidet without the toilet seat attached. It was harder to keep clean. This one looks great but has great features too. I'm very happy with the dual spray heads. The control is easy to operate. I live in AZ so my water never gets that cold and this type of unit works well.
"My major complaint deals with installation. As others have noted, the provided connection between the feed line and the tank is metal intended to mate with very delicate plastic on an angle that is difficult to calculate unless the installer is a contortionist."
Just had a bidet seat installed so I'm rated it on looks and not use for now.
"The BioBidet form Slim Zero is easy to install.... I really recommend it because you have two features in one, the toilet seat and the bidet which makes it more appealing for a minimal space in your bathroom.

Once again, I really recommend this product"
Comfortable and easy to install product
"Must have been easy to install because my husband would have complained ! Ha he didnt!!!!!
Looks clean and sleek. Made well . Its comfortable and hasn't leaked. There is a learning curve with the spray pressure 1st try a bit surprising. Heated would be my choice if getting a second one."
"I bought 4 of these bidets, very poorly designed, they work great but the seat will not stay up, you can move the mounting bracket all the way forward but toilet seat and lid will not stay up, either the toilet handle or the tank lid is in the way snd prevents the toilet lid to stay up, tried to take seat off to see if I could readjust the mount and no easy way to snap it back off with out breaking it, so now I have a broke bidet that seat won’t stay up and now not secure on the mounting bracket, so now it moves back and forth, very disappointed.."
Ok good Fashion Style
"Bought this to replace another bidet that was not the entire seat. I like the way this replaces the entire seat, it works great and the water pressure is stronger that our previous bidet. I’ve been telling all my friends to get one. Reasonably priced too."
Easy install and does the job. Be careful to not crank up the pressure too high.
Well designed and solid. Easy to install but the directions are not very detailed. It works like a charm if you pull the blue tape off the nozzle. We had a moment of disappointment until we checked the nozzle and saw the blue packing tape🥴
"Love this bidet! I used this model while in a hotel while out of town for work and have been wanting to get one since. I finally pulled the trigger and I couldn't be happier! I love all the features of this bidet, the heated seat, the temperature and pressure control of the water, the different spray settings and the night light in the bowl. It was simple to install and is very easy to use. I'd recommend it to everyone and if you haven't used a bidet before this will make you a fan. The only obstacle I can see for most people would be that you need to have an outlet near the toilet to plug into."
We really like that fresh clean feeling. The heated seat is a happy sigh. The adjustable water temperature soothing. We first experienced the luxury of a bidet seat while on a trip during the winter to Seoul. So when I saw where these were manufactured I knew it was going to be great quality. The picture is how it attaches to a Pro-Flush Round Chair toilet purchased from Lowes. I would recommend to have a toilet with the flush buttons on the top of the tank lid instead of a handle flush. The handle interferes with the seat being back all the way. The design also makes the seat connection difficult to get the click that is the goal with proper placement. All said the bidet seat has been a great purchase.
"If you purchase the round one take measurements of your bowl first to check how it we fit. If you are a male and you have this on some round toilets your penis will be touching the porcelain of the toilet. The works well but for men you have to sit awkward to not contact the bowl.
The seat when the elongated version is on an elongated toilet is probably great."
"just replaced old BioBidet with new BioBidet Slim 1. easy enough for even me to install. straightforward to connect. so far just as good as the last one, and that one was a game changer."
Easy install. Functions wonderfully.
"This toilet seat is amazing. It has all the features you could want. It does require an outlet to plug it in but that is what makes it so awesome! The heated seat, the warm water, the night light... you just can't go wrong with this seat if you are looking for a bidet."
"We have 2 other brands & thought this was a slimmer, updated version of bio bidet, but this one is NOT GOOD! The metal thing stays out & looks weird. The sensors don’t work right so it squirts water on the floor. It’s going back for sure (after a pain to attach to my daughters older plumbing)."
You may need a plumber and definitely an eletrcian to install properly. Support is almost non existant. I've been waiting for two weeks now for an RMA generated as a result of the poor web design. I even called them and was told she would send out an email with an RMA but no such action ocurred. In any case the seat lid broke 16 months after installation. That is another $45 for just the lid.
"I will confess that I didn't really think we needed a bidet, but now I don't want to go without (so to speak). Why? Well, this solves a whole bunch of problems that you might not even have known you have:
1) The toilet seat can be opened or closed silently
2) The toilet seat is heated
3) There is a nightlight so you don't have to turn on the overhead light in the middle of the night

Being a bidet, it also basically gives your bottom a shower to get properly clean. This model heats the water, which is great, although the heated seat is even more important to me now!

As long as you have a grounded power outlet relatively close to your toilet, installation is simple. The included hardware will fit most toilets. If it doesn't, there's pretty much only one other connection and a quick call to Bemis will result in them shipping you a free adaptor in just a few days. Our version uses a remote control, but there's also a version with buttons mounted directly to the seat.

The only question I'm left with is why you'd spend hundreds of dollars more on essentially the same features? This is a reliable brand, the bidet is slim and fits well on round or elongated basins, and it offers all the features of any other bidet. Yet it costs less than $200."
"With this ongoing Amazon discount, and after reading all the reviews I just could not resist. After 2 weeks of daily use, I am overall pretty satisfied with the product's build and ease of use. I would've definitely gotten a TOTO a few years ago but it's out of my price range, so the Slim Two is perfect in its affordability and high quality.

Pros:

- Easy installation
- Great sturdy build, especially the heated seat; no creaking/squeaky noises at all
- Remote control (I was initially going for the Slim One (without remote), but the Slim Two (with remote) was less expensive and it's also very nice to not have to twist around to reach the console on non-wireless models); also, the remote comes with a wall mounted dock which you can stick onto the wall with the included adhesive (included) or use screws (not included).
- Pressure options and nozzle positioning is perfect -- I don't understand why some users have reported problems. Perhaps your hose connection is not secure or the emitter is blocked? Also, Turbo Mode pressure is TOO strong -- I still haven't found the need to use this mode. It's so strong that it causes spray-back and leaves the back of the seat with water beads.
- Nightlight (though turning it off is not intuitive at all (the ""+"" button requires a long press of 3 seconds). The nightlight should be light sensitive, triggered by a proximity sensor or simply redesign the remote to include a dedicated nightlight button).
- The water heater works great; lasts more than 60 seconds. The water is not scalding hot, but hot enough for a thorough cleanse. IMO, 30-60 seconds is optimal for a thorough cleanse unless you have a really wide area to work on in which case you double press ""wash"" to activate oscillation for a wide clean.
- Easy installation guide (everyone writes that no guide or manual is included -- my order came with two manuals: a regular installation guide and a quick start guide).
- Toilet paper use and expenditure is cut in half. Only need a small bit for dabbing excess water. Very nice!

Cons:

- I needed to purchase a hose reducer to fit the hose nut over the water connection. It was under $5 at Home Depot.
- The nightlight could be easier to turn on/off (see above).
- The remote interface design is NOT good -- I think BioBidet could take some design cues from TOTO or INAX on good UI design for their remote and also make one universal remote for all their similarly featured models
- When I opened the box and pulled the seat out, residual water dribbled out the hose and unit and spilled all over me which was odd because it is a new, unrefurbished model (or is it?) Very strange -- but the unit looks and smells brand new at least so I'm not overly concerned.
- I know this is beside the point, but the BioBidet logo needs a total brand overhaul. The typeface used in the words ""Bidet"" looks like it can't breathe and is squished together, while the ""Bio"" typeface is relaxed and well-spaced. Consistency will reposition the brand to reflect the brand's high quality products.

Overall: At the sale price of $189, I think EVERYONE should have one of these. You will feel super clean after seconds of washing. When I lift off the seat, I feel so clean while everyone else is walking around with dirty, poo-smeared butts. Yuck! Go get one now!

Update (October 31, 2018): Now that the weather is cooler, I can understand why the heated seat function is such a helpful feature. It never occurred to me previously just how much temperature affects parts of your body, but now I find that I am more relaxed when the seat is warm and can finish my business faster. It's like when you jump into the cold ocean and everything clams up , the same is true when you sit on an ice cold toilet seat -- it just takes forever to peek out and if you don't get to finish your business, you feel backed up and miserable. In the past, I used to think a warm seat would feel kind of gross (like it was just used by someone) but now that I am more relaxed when I sit down, I just can't go on without this feature. I think it helps you achieve regularity.

Update (September 30, 2018): After 30 days of daily use, I would highly recommend the SLIM TWO. The seat is very high quality in terms of construction and function and you will feel so much CLEANER!

Update (July 1, 2019): BioBidet Customer Service is top notch.

Update (August 12, 2021): The second lid replacement suffered the same fate and the hydraulic right hinge broke again. There is no way to fix it since the plastic bit disintegrates and pulverizes into a hundred pieces. I think BioBidet should find a better material that can withstand the test of frequent opening/closing. Other than the hinge issue (which is not a problem with our Toto), the Slim Two is a great deal. But after reading multiple other reviews citing the same hinge quality issue, I may likely switch to the higher quality Toto C200 which I have in another room and has experienced absolutely no issues."
"I have been looking for a bidet for a while. I wanted one before I went to japan (last year) and after I went, I wanted one even more. Unfortunately, a you know, a GOOD bidet is not cheap. You will not find a decent one for less than $200. This model (""Slim TWO"") improves upon its predecessor with heated water and a heated seat as well as a mountable removable remote.

It was easy enough to install, but they should improve on the instructions a bit because there were some issues: 1. The rubber washer that comes with the mounting it is basically useless. I couldn't find a place to put it. The instructions show them, but I am guessing that they are optional in most cases. They literally fit INISIDE the holes, so they don't do anything except get pulled up to the mounting brackets. I actually quite like the mounting hardware. If you need reading glasses, use them when installing- not to read, but to see the tiny divets that hold the mounting brackets securely in place.

The seat, once installed, is secure and feels good. The seat warming feature is excellent- and can be turned on or off as needed. The heat can be controlled, but it's probably best to keep set to high if you're planning on turning it off and on as needed as it will heat up more quickly. The water temperature was not warm at first, but after I ran it once, the water temperature raised within 15 seconds. After a couple minutes, the water heat regulated. Personally, I could do with a bit more pressure, but the highest setting is certainly enough for 99.9% of people. During my test-run, I didn't actually...""go"", but later I ""went"" and found that the whole process is seamless and works well. Although, for me (as embarrassing as this is), I needed two full rinse cycles.

During my test run, I played with the remote a bit and tried the massage feature- it's not what I would call a massage...it's more like spray for one sec, no spray for one second - repeat over and over for duration of cycle. My reaction? Meh. ""Bidet"" vs ""Wash"" setting? Slight difference...not much. Nozzle cleaner? Not much pressure on the nozzle...it's a very basic rinse. You MOST DEFINITELY NEED to utilize the ""manual cleaning"" feature (keep your instruction manual just in case).

The first problem I encountered, was not being able to determine which direction the plastic mounting bracket was designed to face- without playing with the parts a tiny bit (only a slight problem, really). After I determined which direction to put it on, I had to tighten and loosen the bolts several times to minutely adjust the bracket in order to accommodate the seat.

The second problem that I encountered was that the power cord is pretty short. If you are installing into a bathroom without a power outlet within 2 feet, you are probably going to have to ""finagle a situation"". In my case, I used a dremmel drill bit to drill a plug-sized hole through the wall. I snaked the cord through, then I found a plug available on the other side in our laundry room- which I also ""finagled"". Other options are to procure an extension cord (either thru Bio Bidet or elsewhere). I wanted my set-up to look pretty seamless, so I made the perfect sized hole and sent the plug thru the wall into our laundry/furnace/AC room (not a pretty room, so who cares?).

The third problem I encountered was that the remote control is set up backwards to common thought. Instead of starting at the ""Off"" setting and moving up from ""Off"" to ""Low"", pressing the buttons sets it from ""Off"" to ""High"". This is the case for seat heat, water heat, and water pressure. It's a little counter-intuitive in that way.

The last problem (a self-created problem) that I encountered was that the seat I ordered is elongated, but my toilet has a round shaped bowl. I knew I didn't have an elongated toilet and have wanted one for a while, but I wanted the bidet first to make sure I got the right toilet afterward. I have ordered a new toilet bowl to match the elongated version of the Slim Two. The Bio Bidet website helped greatly in determining the various models of several brands of toilets from which I could choose.

The shipping time was fantastic. It arrived within 24 hours. I ordered it at 9:00 AM on Sunday and it arrived before I got up - around 8:00 AM on Monday (today).

Bio Bidet's customer service was excellent when I called about the issue of needing to know what toilet bowls were compatible with the elongated Slim Two.

I also purchased their extended warranty on their website- goes to 6 years from date-of-purchase -for $94 because they have a $5 coupon code.

Why did I purchase the bidet here instead of directly from the manufacturer? Well, as it turns out, they have been doing a lot of business recently (COVID-19 toilet paper shortages and all...) with lots of people making changes. Amazon also lowered the price (for an unknown reason), so it was about $20 cheaper overall. I also ordered thru Amazon because I have prime, so- FREE SHIPPING! Yes!

This purchase was a WIN - WIN - WIN!

I'm really hoping that this product lasts for much longer than the 6 year warranty, but even if it doesn't last past 6years, it will have paid for itself in savings on toilet paper."
"this bidet is fantastic..!! I wish I would have purchased sooner. now, it's kinda like your microwave oven,
ya almost can't live without it... LOL.. it's easy to install on your existing toilet, and works fabulously.
nice, comfortable warm seat is awesome! plenty of cleansing warm water, warm air dryer,
and easy to operate remote control. I can't believe that I lived without a bidet for so many years.
waiting for it to go on sale again and I'm gonna buy several for gifts."
I’ve had the bidet for about a week now and love it. Very easy to install - think it took me about 20 minutes at MOST. I think the instructions could have been a little bit clearer to indicate when to turn off the water and remember to flush the toilet first (I did both of these before starting because…well…common sense!). Seat is comfortable and heats up quickly. Great quality and “gets the job done” lol doesn’t require a rocket scientist to use it. Probably going to get another one for my other bathroom! I would recommend it.
"Pros:
-Price
-Easy install with all needed parts *note you will need a wrench and a phillips head screw driver
-Water pressure

Cons:
The water starts cool, gets warm, turns cool.. the seat gets warm... Not a huge issue.

The size is terrible. They cut half of the seat off at the back for the housing. What you end up with is a tiny toilet seat opening shoved forward so far you have to perch on the thing. Yes, the hole is 11.5 or so inches open, but I end up so far forward because I cannot sit on it because there is only 1"" worth of seat on the back end. The front end also is tiny, like they shaved off an inch here and there but left the hole the same size. The result, I often end up sitting pressed up against the back, and no its not a back rest.

The other issue with size is when you lift the lid, about 2.5"" of the toilet is gone to again accommodate the massive housing for the bidet. So you have a bunch of openings on the underside of the bidet that will get splattered with what ever hits the water, super clean!

The seat has a click rather than being soft close you have to get it over that click to move and then it falls slowly down. I can see this wearing out rather quickly... I've never had a toilet seat with a click past point to close the lid.

There is a beautiful 8x5 sticker on the underside of the lid which is very attractive.

The nightlight stays on 24x7. It can be turned off, but then you'd have to turn it on again every night.

The remote looked like it was a touch remote, however it is a press remote with a thin plastic cover that covers the buttons. Makes it nice to clean with a wipe, but it is a cheap feel to push buttons under the covering vs the appearance on the images.

If you are tiny and can sit on this like a bird on a perch, it's perfect. Also if your bathroom decor accommodates an orthopedic toilet seat by all means this is the one. On the other hand if you're a guy, normal sized person, or anything over 5' tall it's probably not ideal."
"I just installed the Bio Bidet. Setup was super easy and things worked like a charm.
I tested all the features and happy to report, no issues at all.
The product looks really state of the art and looking forward to a long relationship with this BioBidet 😀"
"This was a pretty misleading product unfortunately. you can read up on the dimensions of your toilet and the dimensions of this product. they may match up just fine, but it doesn't really paint a full picture. the TANK IS HUGE! i had a bio bidet USPA PRO from costco and that fit on our toilet just fine. this one, because the tank in the back is so large, completely throws off the installation by jutting the entire seat three inches too far forward. buy this if you have about that much extra clearance near the mounting point. otherwise, you are going to be incredibly uncomfortable trying to use this thing. i would comment more about it's functionality, but i didn't get a chance to try it. super disappointing design.

btw it is not slim in the slightest. i really don't get the name."
"I received my Bio Bidet Slim 3 last week, and have to say I'm very pleased with the performance and general product quality. However, I was not very happy with the very basic instructions for installation and remote set up.

There was no problem deciphering and installing the plumbing lines, but the instructions failed to detail how to do seat adjustments, programming the remote, or other necessary information critical to operating the bidet toilet seat. Furthermore, the company's website has no FAQs or support information, other than a phone number.

For example, upon setting up the bidet seat, the instructions say to slide the seat onto the plastic brace that is attached to the toilet until it locks or clicks into position (also, there were no directions as to which way to place the metal brackets that position the screws affixing the brace to the toilet). So far so good. But, finding the bidet seat extended over the toilet lip, it simply says ""adjust the bracket"" without giving any hint as to unlocking the bidet seat to first remove it. for the plastic I will say that when I called customer support, there was no wait and the support person provided the quick instruction I needed. So unnecessary!

It took me two days to figure out how to set the seat and water temperature to my preferred settings (again, no instructions). I was about to call support once again, but I stumbled on to the proper setting: I still don't know how I did it. If I have to reset for some reason, I'm calling customer support to save time and patience! Once set, I have been quite happy with the performance.

It's a very good product for the money, but the manufacturer needs to do a better job with its installation and operating instructions!"
"Obviously one of the bigger pains is that you need to have an outlet near your toilet. I'm handy enough that I was able to add a GFCI down behind the toilet for a fairly clean install.

I have three complaints:

1) The installation manual includes really tiny diagrams of how to install everything. Installing the bracket for the seat really requires a clearer diagram. I had the metal tabs backward which made the screw heads sit up too high, which made it almost impossible to install the seat. The videos online weren't much help either. It just needs a nice exploded diagram of how this attaches.

2) I feel like the stream isn't perfect. It's not bad, but I feel like there's a bit of side-spray. I haven't really investigated this more (hard to check on this).

3) Even on the strongest setting I feel like I could use more pressure. Not much, but just one more ""click"". Maybe this is because of the water pressure in my house?

Overall though, I'm very happy with this purchase. Assuming I don't have any issues over the next 6+ months, I'll buy more for the other toilets in my house."
"This bidet toilet insert is a great idea for people who have posterior issues. There are many features on this unit which add to the comfort. Water temperature can be adjusted, water pressure can be adjusted, location of cleaning nozzle can be adjusted, temperature of air dryer can be adjusted. The installation was easy, but the installation guide was not easy to read because the pictures were sideways and in a very tiny format. I think they need to make their installation guide larger and turn the photos so that it represents the installer facing the toilet as it is being installed!"
"We did a lot of research before landing on this model. It is trueThe seat is a bit large, but that’s really only when comparing it on top of my particular toilet. It fits perfectly. One of the reasons why we went with this particular seat is because when reading the comments, other reviewers indicated that it was comfortable and felt sturdy. That was also pretty important to me. I didn’t want to feel rickety or flimsy the seat definitely solid.

I like that the remote is easy to read an operate that was important to me. Some of the other remotes out there just seemed too small and overly complicated. This has the ability to program two profiles. My only suggestion for the remote is that the lights stay on for the duration of the entire operation. The heated seat is really nice. There’s a big difference between weird warm seat, and a really nice hot seat. The water stays very warm since there is a reservoir. There are three wash modes with the ability to slightly oscillate. If desired the dryer is very nice you can choose the temperature of the
If you’ve never tried one before, you will never go back. It’s just a nice clean feeling this is probably TMI but for the ladies out heat.."
I was having torn rotator cuff surgery and wanted a bidet with a remote control. The only issue I had was that the round seat was about an inch longer than the round seat on my toilet even though the measurements of the toilet indicated that this seat would fit. But I was able to make it work.
"This one has features that meet the basic needs like seat warming bidet and washing and lights. It also has the metal nozzle which I think it's important. It did have a small seating area because the tank take some space but you get lower price. The problems are the position and shape of the spray is not that good, reflecting bad quality control. Also the plastic material is not good quality. I mean not smooth and have sharp edges."
"@@@@Update@@@@
Customer support responded and will be taking care of my issue.
The bidet was amazing, until it wasn't. The pricetag was high for something that didn't last more than 6 weeks.
Contacted support about a warranty and they've since quit responding.
Very disappointed"
"Installation would have been easier if the instructions had shown how to install the rubber anchors, although the unit can be installed without them. I had to squeeze the hollow rubber ball in the anchors and fold it on itself to be able to get it through the hole, and this I had to figure out on my own. Other people have written reviews saying that they could not get the anchors installed at all, which is a shame because they make the rest of the installation easier.

I also wasn't exactly sure how far back on the toilet to place the mounting plate (there are zero clues for this), and so I had to take the seat off from where I first placed it and move the mounting plate back one notch. I probably should have moved it two notches, but it is extremely difficult to get the seat back onto the mounting plate, and I never want to have to do that again. There are no guides to show you where to place the seat in order for it to fit onto the mounting plate, and so you just have to get lucky. It was worse the second time because it had water in it.

Once it got installed, it was great to use. The water was very warm, even on the medium setting, and the pressure is adjustable, which is very nice. The massage setting is useless, however, but that is not important. The jet does a good job of cleaning (the primary function for this), but the fan for the dryer is too weak to be effective. I decided to hang a hair dryer on the way next to the toilet, and that can take the place of toilet paper.

It is necessary to keep the instructions page (which can be attached to a wall with a suction cup) for the remote control handy, as the icons are not always intuitive. I would never know what some of the buttons on the remote control do without the guide.

I'm overall happy with the product - not happy with the difficult installation."
"This is the most glorious thing that I have ever sat on. I love everything about it. Though I wish you could move the cord to either side. And if the blow dryer got hotter. And the mounting hardware, completely tight and the seat still moves."
" I have never own a bidet till now! If you never tried, this is the perfect option for the price point. It has several options with a remote. You can Pre programming settings for husband and wives ;) and the seat conforms to your body perfectly. If you have grandchildren or kids, there is a child setting. After using each time I get off with a smile because it is glorious!!! Yes glorious!!! I will never use another seat in my future. Don’t knock it till you try it!! The fan works great to dry your bum too. The oscillating spray is amazing!! You can adjust the pressure on the spray and the location. This is the seat for you!!!"
Clean looking and low profile with separate remote. Easy to used!
"Ease of installation, took about 30 - 45 minutes with following the instructions. One hint: semi tighten seat bracket, check for adjustments, remove seat, adjust as needed, tighten screws. Another plus is ease of seat removal."
"This is a better product than the previous Bio bidet that I had that cost twice as much and I used it for 5 years without a problem, at half the price!
There were only two glitches I experienced:
1. Amazon sent me a previously returned unit that looked like it had been in a flood. It still had the return sticker on it to the Amazon returns center! My guess is that the previous customer told Amazon it was OK, but it was DOA when I installed it. The good news was that I was't able to order an identical replacement, so I just got a credit and when I went to order it again, the price had dropped about $60!
2. I didn't look closely at the install instructions and tried to install the T fitting provided at the valve instead of the underside of the toilet. Bio bidet technical support straightened me out politely (they must have had a good laugh!)
It was on sale for a ridiculous price for about $170 something.
It's great. The only feature lacking is a heated dry cycle which I never used."
"The installation instructions for this bidet seat are horrendously, hilariously horrible!! Even the schematics are poor. This particular model uses top-mounted rubber nuts, which it turns out you must twist with the screw partially inserted and use quite a bit of downward pressure to get the ""bulb"" part of the rubber nut through the small toilet seat screw holes. The instructions don't tell or show you ANYTHING about that. And the comapny's YouTube videos completely gloss over that fact as well!! I spent more than 2 hours over 2 days futzing with this seat, watching videos, reading reviews and finally calling the company, which apparently isn't taking phone calls right now. Then did the website chat, and haven't heard a peep from them. I found a video from an entirely different company using the same type of rubber nuts, which you must use if you have a skirted toilet -- which I don't, so why were these used for this model seat in the first place? Once I figured it out the next day (after a couple beers to cool off my hot head!) I finally got this thing installed. The small metal brackets must be perpendcular, with the concave side facing upward, to the plastic mounting bracket. It seems to operate well enough, though not as immediately responsive as my friend's Toto toilet (which cost him $1,500!!). So, for abnout $275, I got what I wanted sans the dryer function, which i never use anyway. BUT, it was not without a few swear words during installation. BioBidet needs to re-write its instruction sheets using native English-speakers for the narrative and better graphics."
"I have read a lot of reviews that speak to the difficulties of the bidet install. I had no issues with the install and the bidet works well – as of day 2. I must admit, I have installed 6 other bidets so I am not new to this procedure. I did note there a videos on the web to assist. I do have a few things of note. You cannot sit on the lid, the slant and the structure would not support you. Another point is, and I quote “Using harsh cleaning chemicals can damage and develop cracks on your bidet seat. Using only water and a soft cloth is suggested….Do not use any cleaning chemicals…Make sure no toilet bowl cleaner gets in contact with any part of the bidet” Now this is a TOILET SEAT and I wish I could use CLEANING PRODUCTS”. Finally I might mention that I am instructed to “Mail, Email, or fax the warranty form to: YOUR LOCAL DEALER FIRST where you bought this appliance”. Wondering, should I send it to Jeff Bazos?"
Just had this Bidet installed and it works great …in my grandsons opinion…gramma this is the best toilet ever …
"The Slim 3 is a great value and offers many features of the higher priced models

The remote puts this product over the top"
I am very satisfied.
"Never really use the blower but it is there. Wish the nose came out a bit further it has everything you need and nothing you done.

Installation was five min. Took me longer to unbox it. I did install an outlet before getting the seat I should have put it on the right instead of the left but cord was plenty long. Going to order another or the other bath room wish it had an auto feature and a little more Tubo pressure but it’s great."
"This bidet is PERFECT, I cannot see myself without this product at all anymore. The seat is warm every cold morning, and the instant hot water you get is the best. The pressure is perfect for removing any debris and there is a fan, and its HOT! Will never go back to a traditional seat."
"All in all, this is a good product. I benefitted from reading reviews regarding installation. It helped me avoid mistakes and be patient with the process, which took me about an hour. For those wondering about the rubber nuts that have to squeeze through the attachment hole in the toilet - I found that VERY GENTLE pressure with a non-scratch tool (I used a hard plastic child's screw driver) on one side, while pushing with your hand on the other side, allowed the bump to slide down pretty easily. The seat is very soft and comfortable. I am glad for the option of turning off the night light, and the seat heater. My one disappointment is that the remote is completely smooth and not backlit. So, in the dark, one is left guessing about where the correct button would be. I can see that maybe from a cleaning standpoint, this is easier to wipe clean. But, not very practical otherwise. Anyone who has used the BioBidet toilet attachment will notice that the water pressure in this unit is much less, but enough. I would recommend this item."
"LOVE having the blue light if I have to go during the night. Just adds a little more height and the seat is more comfortable than a standard toilet seat. I personally use the child setting which gets the job done. Nice to be using much less toilet tissue. Buyers just know the rim sits on the toilet not in it. The person who installed ours was convinced it didn't fit, I had to convince them that it was correct."
I have always heard that any one can sell a product. A company that stands behind that product is the true test. We purchased this item in July of 2022. the water inlet broke away from the seat. I emailed customer service and got a prompt response. We sent the bedit in and had it back in a week! All fixed and pretty. So nice to see a company stand behind its products! I was not sure If i could list the names that I had contact but all three of them were great ! ! ! All around a great experience.
"I love this product. Hi tech warm seat, warm water makes it easy to go to the bathroom in the cold winter days"
"This ""Bio Bidet"" toilet seat / Bidet attachment is life changing new experience! Heated seat makes life so much comfortable in winter. Bidet attachment with warm water takes comfort and cleanliness to a different level. Will recommend this to anyone!!"
"Bidet toilet seats are a game-changer, and the Bio Bidet by Bemis Slim Three is no exception. From its sleek design to its efficient functionality, it truly revolutionizes the bathroom experience.

One of the standout features for me is the temperature control. There's something profoundly satisfying about customizing the water temperature to one's preference, and this bidet delivers on that. Whether you prefer a refreshing spritz or a warm cleanse, this bidet has got you covered.

A minor gripe would be the blue light's ON/OFF button. It can be somewhat tricky to navigate at times. While it’s not a major issue, it's something that could be improved in future iterations. However, this small detail hardly detracts from the overall excellent performance and user experience of the product.

In summary, the Bio Bidet by Bemis Slim Three Smart Bidet Toilet Seat is a top-tier choice for those looking to elevate their bathroom routine. The advanced features, paired with its aesthetically pleasing design, make it worth every penny. Highly recommended!"
"The bidet is great however, installation instructions are lacking the rubber screws that connect the bidet to the toilet are not easy to install. Instructions are very vague was a bit of a challenge to get it to mount properly."
"This thing is everything I wanted. I haven't used bathroom tissue since the start of the pandemic. If you can fit this in your budget, get one! If you're going to use an extension cord, make sure it is rated for the proper volts, etc..."
"Overall, this is a nice bidet at a very good price with some caveats.
+ nice looking
+ built-in nightlight
- the seat doesn't line up well on some toilets with a forward curved tank, especially noticeable on toilets with a round bowl
- the lid has a steep angle that precludes its use as a seat, such as where one might sit while giving a toddler a bath
I tried it for a few weeks and have no complaints about its functions. However, the shortened opening makes it awkward for males and some females."
We overall like these bidets. Good consistent performance. Biggest weak spot to this point has been the seat dampers. They last about 12-18 months.
"The installation goes pretty well, though you need to be firm in tightening the joints. The experience of use is satisfactory though there is little difference between the bidet and the turbo feature. The remote works well but the instructions for individualization are insufficient Raising and lowering the lid is easy and not prone to sudden drops."
"The seat itself is made of plastic that seems to be hollow rather than a stronger material. After having this just about 2 years, a large ""crack"" developed which is jagged and pinches your skin/cuts you on use. For reference, I weigh only 140 pounds, so this will not be a good option for anyone who weighs more than a teenager.

No way to contact the merchant to get assistance/replacement :( Loved it while it lasted, but didn't last long."
critical parts missing. Old seat anchorage connectors had to be re-used luckily they are just barely fitted. It seems working now. Will see how long/good it will work.
My husband spent 2 hours setting it up. The manual is easy to follow. The best feature is the seat warmer and nozzle cleaning.
"I have been a Bio Bidet customer for about ten years. The Slim 2 has been my favorite. It’s affordable, easy to install, and feature rich with a remote control to set everything from pressure to water temperature. When I had an issue with my first bidet because the pipes in my house, I looked up the companies information and was surprised to see their HQ was only 30 minutes from me. I drove there, and they not only helped me but gave me the parts I needed for free! Can you imagine just showing up at a companies HQ and getting this level of service! They are fantastic! I have owned several Slim 2’s over the years, and only continue to buy them because I moved a bunch of times and was told my the realtor the bidet should stay as it’s considered part of the home. I just moved in a new home last week and one of the first orders I placed was the Slim 2 from Bio Bidet. Water does do it better- I can’t image going back to regular paper! Great company, fantastic support and a superb product! Give it a try and you won’t be disappointed!"
"This works great so far. Don’t sit on the lid, its way too light duty for that. Not sure I like the plastic feel on the behind. Just don’t seem natural."
A crack in the base unit after 2 months.
"The easy install and heated seat and wash, with a heated blow dry! What more could you ask for?"
"Love everything about this bidet! I hired a plumber but he just had to plug it in. Only seat BIDET combination self heats the water,self cleans stainless steel nozzles, warm seat& blue light so no need for harsh bathroom lights. It's comfortable. I had handicapped access handle bars put on both sides of the toilet. The Remote on the wall, easy to use& numerous changes to have heat level,stream force& angle, positioning, easy to use! Just can't add gel cushions on top like I had bc I have serious back pain and sciatica. I found this is only toilet seat that didn't aggregate my discs& nerves.
My urologist and infectious disease Drs recommended a bidet bc rare resistance bacteria in my cultures,UTI. I had BIDET in European home but never in USA. Way underutilized we all need bidets,cuts down on toilet paper, recurrent infections,less need for baby wipes& Hibiclens and HYGEA. Still use them after bidet but b4 bidet use several to clean. This bidet is amazing. Comes in round& elongated. Very seriously recommend as a board certified family physician and VERY SATISFIED PATIENT. REASONABLE COSTS!!
DR TOULA MILIOS GUILFOYLE"
"The bidet works great however the remote sucks!! Paid $70 for a replacement remote and it didn’t work at all. Tried calling bio bidet for weeks no one was available to take our call. We left our information several times and finally received a couple emails asking which bidet we had and which remote etc. finally I asked them to either replace it or send our money back and they stopped emailing us. I’ve called for weeks and emailed for weeks, still no reply! Will never buy from this company again!!"
"As someone who was a bit on the fence about using a bidet...I was pleasantly surprised. Works well and has lots of settings. Its bigger than I thought it would be and the hole for the seat is about an inch smalles than our ""dumb"" seat. But you yet used to the slightly smaller seat.
My only issue is that the dual person settings do not work. No matter how many times we've tried to set them it will not save. But over all this bidet works great."
"Firstly, this bidet is easy to install and works great. Both my wife and I like the functionality and features of the product.

Unfortunately, after 1 year of use, the lid lost its soft-close function. After determining that the slot where the damper rides in the lid cracked (the damper was still fine) I sanded the parts, cleaned them, and put some 5min epoxy to hold the damper in place. Boom! Functioning soft-close lid without paying $40 for a replacement.

If you buy this, I would go ahead and pull the lid off (pull straight up on the left hinge), take the damper cover and damper out (1 Philips screw), and fill the ribs outside of the damper key (rectangle where the damper interfaces with the lid) with epoxy. The ribs they used so that the mold wouldn't have sinks around that area weaken it so that the sides of the damper key (the plastic feature in the lid) will eventually crack and break from the torque on the lid. I used the loctite 5 min epoxy with mixing nozzle available on amazon for $4."
"Update: Amazon was great about compensation and BioBidet was truly excellent (shout out to Ashley) about trying to find a solution. Overall I like this company and I think we just had one bad experience. We have another BioBidet bidet (a manual) that works beautifully.

I have just had it with this product. It took so long trying to work things out with the company that my return window loses. They had my returned product for weeks before beginning to address it and then said there was “nothing wrong” I specified that the child feature was not working despite my child sitting on the seat and using it correctly.
They tried to gaslight me so many times.
Finally got it back and installed and ... you guessed it - still doesn’t work.
So I did my own test. That little weight sensor that should be shut off so a child can use it? Doesn’t work.
Sure the child feature works if an ADULT sits on the seat. Not the same thing.
And now we get to go through another jerk-around.
Maybe this message will help someone actually address this issue. Maybe not. Super unhappy.
Oh and since I have had other bidets before I can say that I wish I had just gone with the Toto that I know and loved. This was supposed to be easier but everything from the remote to the “special features” (which it turns out are also on the Toto) to the repeated refusal to make this usable for my children (as advertised) who I specifically paid extra for ... not worth it."
"Installation and set up is not easy. No instructions how to position front to back. I had to set up then factory reset 3 times. Also now I find that the seat heater is only on ""a short time"" so it is cold half the time I use it. I still can't figure out user presets. The first shot of water is always cold. We also have a Toto Washlet. A much better bidet but more expensive. My wife wouldn't put up with the Slim 3."
The product is wonderful and very comfortable. We would really appreciate if the handle hand ranch was provided for easy installation. Thanks
"I bought a ""round"" model Bidet, but apparently it does not completely fit the ""round"" toilet, about 0.5"" off in length."
"I plan to do this much sooner. Unfortunately, two surgeries became a priority over this the pros are the heated seat the remote control, the heated water and a quiet lid. The cons are the paint fades after about a year considering the cost this was very disappointing. Otherwise, I would say it’s a good purchase. I decrease the number of stars to three because of the poor quality of paint, it is in the powder room, that guests use, which makes it rather embarrassing. I will most likely have to replace it sooner rather than later."
I liked the options with this bidet which is what lead me to pick this particular one. I found the video helpful for the install since the directions were very vague. Does what I bought it for.
I do wish the plug cord might be longer
"A couple of things on this Bidet that I do not care for.

One is the instructions are not very good and I still, even after watching videos and reading other peoples comments am unable to turn on the light so that when you go in at night you can line up for final approach to the seat.

It also has no fan or heat to dry your bum.

The good thing is that there are plenty of buttons and none have a tampon remover so you don't accidentally yank your junk out.

The turbo wash made my eyes cross the first time I used it on the second setting. That function is not for the faint at heart. Use with caution.

But all in all its a pretty good Bidet for the price. It hooks up fairly easy but most people do not have a plug in right next to the toilet so you may have to hire an electrician to put an outlet in next to your toilet or run an extension cord to you plug outlet.

My wife was not too thrilled with the orange heavy duty extension cord I ran across the sink to plug the thing in."
Many features compared to other similar products.
"If the included fitting fits your plumbing and you have an electrical outlet nearby, this is literally a 5 minute or less install. Unfortunately, our RV toilet uses a different thread, and the angle of the plumbing required some creativity, but I wouldn't take anything away from the product for that.
The seat is pretty comfortable, but you do lose a lot of space in the opening compared to a traditional oval toilet seat.
We love the heated seat feature!!!
It's taking my wife a little time to get used to aiming the water stream, but I have had no problems, and I don't know how I've lived so long without it!
It has adjustable seat and water temp controls, as well as flow and position controls.
I weigh close to 300lbs, and the seat feels very solid."
Don’t really get excited over purchases these days but this gem is well worth it! Nothing like a very clean bottom. Wife says I enjoy it a little to much :)
Sadly after 3 months the water heater has stopped working. It fits our toilet poorly. Otherwise the functionality of the unit is great. The remote has no back lighting so when operating in the dark I hit the wrong button now and then.
It reduce the size of seat so why have an elongated bowel in the first place.
"The remote is terrible - half the time it does not work and you have to keep pushing the buttons trying to get it to function, rarely works with initial attempt. At first I thought battery that came with it must be the problem, so swapped it out with brand new energizer batteries, but no improvement in working. If it weren’t for the buttons on the side of the bidet (that do work but don’t have all the controls like water temp, nozzle location, spray pressure, etc.), this would just be an expensive toilet seat!"
I like all of the functions on the remote! My wife wastes so much toilet paper that buying this will save money. I have purchased Toto brand in the past and the is less expensive and just as good!
luv this bidet now have two in our house!!
"This bidet is very functional, but not much difference between regular spray and turbo. The instructions need to be more detailed, it has a rubber bolt sleeve and no instructions how to place it properly.
Most importantly, it says not to use cleaners on the seat. My goodness, it’s a toilet seat, it needs to be cleaned and water is not enough."
I received the Bidet sooner that anticipated. Installation was easy and straight forward according to the instructions. Bidet looks great and functions great
I like the product and the option to select my favorite is the warm water.
We installed this unit just 2 months ago and have been very happy with it EXCEPT for a major design flaw. The issue is the toilet seat will start to develop a crack. Searching youtube this is a common problem and replacing the seat is a major effort as it is not a standard seat. BEST TO AVOID!
"IT TOTALLY CLEANS IT!!
You know what? Toilet paper is a SCAM!! This cleans my butt SO much better than paper.
Hip hip hooray for my new BioBidet!"
"Nothing to dislike about this throne of THRONES. So super easy to install and the functions are fabulous.
My wife loves me again. LOL ( she always loves me)"
"We bought one of these during the toilet tissue shortage and have really appreciated having it. We feel much cleaner and I'm sure our septic system appreciates receiving less TP. We bought a second one for our daughter who has bowel issues and she loves it too! It's easy to install, but don't overlook that you need an electrical outlet near the toilet to plug it into. That was a bit of a hassle at our daughter's place."
"It looks sleek and nice. I like the remote attached to the wall. There is no spillage of outside. Those are my two stars for.
I purchased this product - two of these bidets in March 2021. After one year - one of the bidets had issues - no water came off the water tube even though the water tube came out. I changed the batteries for both at that point. Then ordered a new product to replace the one that had issues. I had a handyman come again to install. After seven months the item I changed started acting up. Now the water tube doesn't come out for the new item. Meanwhile the other product is also having issues ( water flow is slow).
I did call a handyman each time the product had issues.
For all the money I paid for the product - it is not worth it. I will go with a different manufacturer."
"Nice seat, glad I made to choice with this one. There are so many on the market. I had a few features that I needed the seat to have and this was the only model at the time which was Heated, Nite-light, & heated water.
I saw the reviews about the round model extending beyond some brands of toilet but I gave it a try anyway. This seat does also extend beyond my toilet for about an inch but that's fine for what I'm gaining with the seat."
"Another update (7/17/2020):
After receiving the replacement I could not be more happy so in order another for my second bathroom...it arrived the next day but like the first, the soft close lid was not working. Had to return it & the replacement is being delivered today (7/17/2020). Will update again once I receive it & check the soft lid close function.
In a nutshell, order 3. Only 1 had no soft lid close issue but waiting for next replacement.

-9/15/19 Seat was delivered.
-Installation: some missing parts (rubber foot on bracket).
-parts are very different that instruction video on Bio Bidet.
-adjusting the seat, isn’t very easy to do due to the different plate and brackets in the box then that are in Bio Bidet website/videos.
-top kid was broken. The slow close didn’t work.
-9/15/19 returned to Kohl’s awaiting replacement seat.

So far, I am not happy with the product installation, product (without using) and include hardware.

Will update once a good replacement has been received.

9/26/19 Update: this is a great bidet! My butt is bougie now and can’t go back to just toilet paper alone. If they only had a mink seat version, I’d buy it."
"Easy to install! Choice of streams! Choice of positions! Comfortable seat, Choice of pressure! Does the job!! Especially affective for people with hemorrhoids! Saves toilet paper! Best of all remote control you can attach in convenience location!!"
"Easy to install. We have had one on another toilet for over a year, and it works great! No more TP!"
"This was my favorite purchase in some time. I wouldn’t say the seat is comfortable as they use some cheap material but it’s comfortable enough. The remote and sprayer work great…until it didn’t.

During normal use, I heard a snap and whatever part makes the sprayer go in and out just broke.

I called the company and found out this model only has a 1 yr warranty.

To fix the part is $185 plus shipping on a product that costs $240.

I get it. Companies have policies but this sucks. I had another issue earlier in the year and received horrible customer service.

Okay product but I wouldn’t buy this brand again."
"This is our 3rd bidet toilet seat. The first (different brands) started leaking after about a year, the second was a basic cold water bidet that didn't mount well & didn't fit our oblong toilet bowl. This one is great so far. Installation was pretty easy, could have used more detail on the toilet seat mount plastic bracket, I installed it backwards at first. The arrow is pointing to the back, NOT the front. The remote seems too big & square & could really use some backlighting for night, but it works fine. The blue night light is cool. It stays on always, not sure if that is because of the dark bathroom or not. Those are my only gripes. Overall 4 stars!"
"It's been a week having this installed at my bath. So far so good.
The installation was easy enough. I was done in less than half an hour. Everything was exactly what I expected. The only thing I miss is the air dry function of it. I thought that function was part of the feature of this unit. Other than that, I love this bidet."
"This is the first bidet seat I ever used. Very impressed with not having to use toilet paper. I have this installed in an outside bathroom near a swimming pool, so very useful. I am not very impressed with the drying ability. When I am done with my business, I keep moving but the dryer is a little weak in drying your butt so you must chill for a minute. The seat warmer is pretty cool but it doesn't get super cold in Southern CA. If you never had one before, this is pretty good for the money. I may try upgrading later, but this does the job."
"We used the Japanese bidet/toilets while we were traveling in Japan and when we returned, we said we were going to buy them and replace our toilets with them. But we didn't. Several years passed and I would think of it from time to time, but just didn't want to shell out the money for them. When COVID-19 came to the US, and TP was a scarcity, I decided to finally buy one. We bought this brand and we are delighted so far! It's WONDERFUL! I feel so clean and the seat is so welcoming and luxurious feeling. I highly recommend this product and you don't have to go out and buy a whole separate bidet and plumb and all. This is perfect! Easy to install. Hopefully, it will last. It seems like it will."
I like it. I wish it had a stronger spray. My first experience was in Hawaii and when I got home I wanted one and so did my wife. She wishes that the sprayer would come out more for the front. I'm not sure a dryer is all that quick to dry so I got one without. For the price it's great. Installation was easy to figure out and it came with all the parts so no extra trips to the hardware store. To me the turbo wash is the same as the other wash buttons so that's useless.
"Nothing to dislike.
really unique features for any purpose."
I contacted Bio Bidet with a question and immediately received an answer to my question. I purchased 3 Bio Bidet seats and love them. I wholeheartedly recommend the company because of the quality and customer service. D. Bartash
"I have been out of the country a few years and have not had access to a bidet all that time. So upon arriving back to the US one of the first things I purchased was this bidet seat and I am so happy I did.
Not only is so simple to install but the fit and finish of the product is amazing for the price. Previous seats I have purchased in the past were much more expensive for no additional features. If you are even just thinking about trying one of these then its time to get off the seat and do it! You wont regret it. Best clean feeling you can have without a shower. Love it."
We have Kohler toilets and this item fit perfectly. It was easy to install and has many settings and alternatives on the remote. This is an excellent addition to any bathroom. The fittings and cord are of sufficient length for all of our baths. I did add outlets on the left side of the toilet and the cord was long enough to reach. I am going to purchase a couple more of these for our summer home.
"The Biobidet slim two smart toilet seat is a winner. I've owned around 4 bidet toilet seats in my life, and at this point, I couldn't live without one for long. I just installed this model in our guest bathroom and found it to be well made, super easy to install and it appears to have the build quality to make it last. The best part is that I got in on Prime Day for $100 off...wow! I would have been really happy with this seat for full price, because it is a nice and has all the features of much more expensive products, works just as well, but costs much less."
"Pretty amazing product, thought it would be difficult to install but was pretty easy and no leaks which I was really happy about!
The slim two has sleek design toilet seat and water get warm right away last a long time, powerful water stream! with a lot of settings and the remote control is super nice to operate from. My only complaint and one only is the power cord is pretty short so I had to improvise With an extension cord until I can figure something else out so it is plugged in to a GFI outlet! Good price and quality compared to the others that were double in price very impressed!"
"I bought and installed the Bio Bidet Slim Three. Fairly straightforward and easy to install but once installed the remote control would not operate the bidet. Called customer service (if you can call it that) and got a recoded message directing me to their website and advising that the response time was 4 to 5 business days! Filled out the necessary form with note adding my phone number thinking it would be easy for someone to call and advise what needed to be done to solve the problem. But instead received an email in ONLY three days asking for product information, sale receipt, etc. so they could verify my warranty. I responded that, In my opinion, the response time and customer service was just not acceptable and I am returning the bidet. On top of all that when the nozzle extended and retracted it was noisy and water dripped from the retracted nozzle for a few seconds. Back to Brondell for me."
Got this on sake was really looking forward to using it but did not fit my toilet. My tank wouldn't alow the seat to align with brackets.. :(
We have owned this for 3 months. We absolutely love the bidet. It was easy to install. You will need an electric outlet near toilet. The remote is very handy. We didnt know what to think because this was our first time ever using one. And what a great addition to the house. This addition to the bathroom experience is somthing NO house should be without. There is no way toilet paper can clean you the way a bidet can clean you.
"I've always thought this would be perhaps better/cleaner way to go, but that it would be too awkward. I finally bought the slim two since it was on sale. Install took ~20mins on a Kohler highline. I live in the US, 10 year old home and was able to use the adapter in the box. There was a tiny amount of water in the lines as others have noted on the unit maybe from factory testing, but otherwise definitely looks brand new. It's really great and no issues so far. Building a new house currently and I'm going to make sure we have outlets near the toilets for these."
"*EDIT: I contacted the company directly via email and they were really friendly and responsive, sending a replacement lid quickly!* Remote control is nice as we don’t have enough clearance for a side-mounted control panel. Only disappointment is that the soft close lid stopped working 6 months in and now it clicks every time we close it manually. Waiting on customer service to sort that out but it really shouldn’t have happened in the first place. I’ve seen other reviews that note this issue as well."
led night is not able to be turn off during daytime.
Prior to this bidet I had purchased the $25 dollar version and it only took one use to realize tap water is COLD on my delicate parts! This bidet super easy to install and works like a dream. It compares well to units sold on Amazon for over $400. The only things I would change would be to light the remote so I don't have to navigate it in the dark and to separate the pressure and distance commands but for the $259 that I spent this is a great solution
"While the product does everything you'd expect a bidet to do, with so much competition on the market, it leaves some aspects to be desired. This was a particularly desirable bidet initially for its advertisement of a wide spray, which isn't ultimately noticeably different from the other settings. Noise is an issue w/ this bidet along with how long one has to wait for the nozzle to come out. The nightlight should really have a way to automatically turn off/turn on. Regardless of how little energy it expends, it's a waste for it to always be on. Additionally, other competitors have a much slimmer remote profile than this one. Would I buy from BioBidet again based on the availability of others? Probably not."
The bidet does not stay tight on the basin also the remote buttons on the side are very hard to press being that they are flush with the body of remote.
"The water pressure is not satisfying even when you use the turbo and the night lamp doesn't go off. It's on the whole time even in the daylight so you know it is eventually going to die on you sooner than it should be. The water pressure is not satisfying it feels like you are trying to catch the water to have you clean, so after every cycle, you have to do another cycle now your time being in the restroom takes longer than it should."
"OVERVIEW: I never tried a bidet before, but with the scarcity of toilet paper, I thought to give it a try. Wow! I will NEVER use TP again! I have never been so comfortable, so clean, so fresh! I'm a Primary Care Medical provider, and I can recommend this for my patients with mild to severe hemorrhoids, postpartum or post surgical peri-care or frequent UTIs. Everything is adjustable from water temperature, angle, movement pattern, aeration, water pressure, heated seat, air-drier temperature - this unit is amazing for the price. It converts any toilet into a very good quality bidet with minimal effort. Let's talk specifics.

Installation: You will need an adjustable wrench (or pliers will do) and a large screwdriver (straight). You will also need an extension cord to plug this in. The power cord is only 3' long. Plug into a GFCI outlet only for safety. The included hardware has all you will need - including a 3/8"" adapter for the hoses to attach to your water supply. You don't need thread tape as all the connections are low torque compression fittings. There is a small white nylon bushing that comes inside the 3/8: adapter. Make sure you install that on the water supply side (3/8"" side) or it will leak no matter how much you tighten. If it leaks, you have it on the wrong side of the adapter. The supply line hoses provided are loo long for most installations, so I looped mine as it wasn't worth it to me to drive and get shorter lines from the hardware store. The lines are white supply hoses. You can buy steel mesh lines in shorter lengths if you are picky about appearances, but looping them looked fine to me.

The installation instructions are weak, but you can figure it out if you know how to build things. If you don't, ask your handy friend to come help. It literally took me 10 minutes to install. They are very vague on the seat installation, so it bears mentioning that I loosely installed the adjustment plate onto the seat first, with the nylon screws sticking out, and THEN put the screws through the holes in the toilet. Following their instructions to install the plate and screws first resulted in an angle not being able to see to line up the slides and it was very frustrating. But my method worked easily. TIP: They don't tell you in the instructions, but the metal channels have to be installed with the edges down so they engage with the adjustment grip detents.

USE: The unit has a small water heater tank that fills when you turn on the water. It has two power settings. When you first turn on the power, you see a RED LED for high power which will heat your water quickly - like 5 minutes. The water can be uncomfortably warm on highest setting, but it's adjustable. Medium is just right for me. The water cools a bit toward the end of the auto wash cycle in this setting, but it's refreshing.

If you press POWER again, the LED turns GREEN which is economy mode. It takes a bit longer to heat the water, and results in the water getting COLD halfway through your auto wash. It's a good setting to just leave it on all day if you're around the house, but I recommend when you sit down to use it, press POWER twice to put it back in HIGH mode.

CLEANSE is a no frills spray for the backside. You can adjust the pressure and aim with buttons.
BIDET is a no frills wash for the ladies. Adjust water pressure and aim with buttons.
DRY turns on the adjustable heated blower. This is NOT an ""air purifier"" as some reviewers state.
AERATED injects air bubbles into the stream making for a wider more gentle water stream.
MASSAGE moves the stream back and forward along the target zone to get you cleaner.
It also has an adjustable heated seat and self-cleaning spray nozzles. Also has a cleaning mode to extend nozzles for brushing/cleaning for hard water buildup.

RECOMMENDATION: For simplicity, ease of use and comfort, I highly recommend pressing AUTO and then AERATE. This gives you a fully automated cleansing wash, massage and dry and you don't have to press any more buttons. Ladies can press AUTO and BIDET for a fully automated feminine wash and dry.

NOTES: The water pressure and stream intensity can be a bit shocking for first time users. The pressure is adjustable, but even on low it might take getting used to for some. Try the KIDS setting. But if you press AERATE, it softens the impact for a MUCH more comfortable experience.

SEAT WARMER: Gets really warm quickly. I recommend you don't leave this on overnight, but turn it on right before you need it. It's warm in 1 min. Then shut it off as it will likely discolor the seat plastic it left on 24/7 for months.

PROS: This works great and the price is affordable.
CONS: No cons.
IMPROVEMENTS: The ONLY things I can think of to make this unit better would be a nightlight that shines into the bowl (like a blue LED) and a back lit control panel for night use. Also, motion activated seat and water heating for efficiency. It's a waste to keep the water warm all day for maybe 1-2 uses per day.

Hope this helps! Enjoy!"
"1) Warm Water:
I wanted a bidet with heated water so economy bidets were out. The water starts out warm and slowly gets less so, but not cold and never unpleasant.

2) Controls:
I thought I should spend more to get unit with a remote with user settings, but I'm glad I didn't. I like that the controls are right next to me and not hidden in menus or on different sides of a remote like others. I find that I like pushing the buttons I want, when I want them. My daughter likes the ""kids"" button. She's 6 and still yells ""can you come check me"" because shes worried she didn't get all the poop. She loves knowing she absolutely clean. The Auto button is cool, but I don't use it much. It runs through the gamut of functions with one push and ends with the dryer. Oh, at the start of each use, the nozzle starts in the middle position, water pressure at middle pressure, etc. They're perfect just like that 95% of the time. Makes me wonder what analysis went into figuring out right where to aim for that middle position :).

3) Dryer:
The dryer actually does get you mostly dry. Even though there's still a little dampness, I don't mind, it's just a bit of clean water. Maybe if you sit there for two or three cycles of the dryer it would get you completely dry. A bit more on the buttons, push the bidet button once and it cleans without oscillation, push it again and it oscillates. Same for womens. A second push of the dryer button increases fan speed. It gets warm enough for sure. Now even if you want to wipe any excess water off, you're still using less toilet paper because you would have grabbed for some twice or thrice instead of just once.

4) Water Pressure:
Some others say they have the Most water pressure so I was worried this wouldn't have enough for a guy who needs some power washing at times. It has enough. Enough for an upset stomach event.

5) Water temp:
I keep it on economy mode so it keeps the water at a comfortable 86 degrees instead of the middle temp constantly. Once you sit down, it starts to heat the water up even more to your setting. It doesn't get up there in time for a #1, but does if you sit there a bit for a #2. And as I stated earlier, it never gets to an uncomfortably cold temperature. Maybe 86 degrees at least. And that's much warmer than the straight cold tap.
6) Seat:
I got the Round version for my round toilet. All of these bidet seats seems to push you forward and leave less room left. Not enough to be a problem (5'-6"", 150lbs). Not enough to not want to keep it. Not even close. Actually my neighbor is (6'-3"", 220lbs) and got this same seat 3 weeks before me. He loves it too. I did not get this because he did though. I researched HARD for 6 days and decided on this one. Oh the seat is heated. On the economy setting it seems to keep the seat at a temp like someone else just got off of it. Then it starts to warm it up more once you sit down. You’re not supposed to sit on the seat lid, which we never do anyway. The lid is slow closing which we love. All of our lids were already slow closing. Must have.

7) Other Bidet Comparisons:
While at the time the in-stock pickings were slim, this one was in stock. But I could have got the comparable Toto C100 or C200. The greater price of the Toto wasn't an issue. I still picked this one. It may be because I called Bio-Bidet customer support and a very friendly/helpful woman talked about bidet's and bidet comparisons with me. While we talked, she suddenly said she found this one in stock on Amazon. It wasn't in stock the day before so I hadn't even checked again. That was helpful and she was nice, and if I needed help with a new type of product I purchase, I wanted it to be someone like them.

8) Missing Features?:
No night light which I'm fine with, we have a tiny night light plugged into an outlet. No auto seat opening which I'm fine with as it would likely open every time I walked by it to the closet or it wouldn't open fast enough, etc. No deodorizer which I'm fine with as I don't want to replace deodorizer cartridges. Maybe it would be nice for a main floor bathroom where visiting guests can take a #2 and not worry about the smell and be embarrassed because most vents take a while to get that all out. No remote which I'm fine with as all of the remotes seem to have functions on the front, back and even sides. Too much fiddling around to be worth having user presets. Easier for my daughter to use and for my wife to get on board with the controls all being in the open and right on the side.

9) Installation:
Easy. Everything I needed was provided except a crescent wrench and maybe white plumber tape to make sure the connections do not leak. They may have provided some, but I already had some. Took me a leisurely 45 minutes."
"I have had my BioBidet BB-600 for about a week now. So far it is great. It was very easy to install...probably took 15 minutes or so. This was the first time using a bidet....a little strange at first but I love it now. I wont need to order anymore Mangroomer Bix Wipes ($20 every three months). The toilet paper use will dramatically decrease.

Now how it works: In the summer the water heater is not that important. I did try it out. It is nice and warm and it lasts a good bit of time. It wont last the whole time the water is spraying. But i dont think it will be that big a problem. The pressure is great and is adjustable. You can also adjust the position of the spray. Press the clensing button twice and the water spray moves back and forth which is great for getting the whole area clean. The masssage and aerated spray are great too. Just give you a little differnet feel. The air dryer works and is warm (air temp is adjustable), but i think it would take too long to get totally dry. Who wants to sit there for a minute or two waiting for the water to evaporate off your bum. I just use a few squares and TP and tap my butt dry. All in all it is a great device. I have never felt cleaner. I look forward to using it everyday. The product seems to be high quality. Well worth the money for this mid priced bidet."
"I never before had a bidet, but eventually (now that I'm retired) decided to get one. The hope was that this bidet would allow me to be washed/clean after going, vs simply the wiped but not clean that paper alone gives). This unit does in fact do what I expected, but it was a major PITA to install initially.

Before starting, I had expected the entire install to take a few hours at most (since I have done some toilet installs/repairs over the years, and this is just a seat install plus a little extra water plumbing). Instead I ended up spending about 3 weeks (during which time I was not able to use that toilet in the house) before the job was done. The install problems were mostly the result of 3 issues.

First off, I've never seen a toilet seat require anything like the mounting that this bidet required (a mounting piece bolted to the toilet, using a non-obvious bolting arrangement, and then the bidet snaps into the mounting piece). That first problem (non-standard mounting required) would be OK, if the instruction manual walked you though how to do the mounting. But the second issue is that the instruction manual is (in my opinion) poorly written and way too lacking in important details. In the case of the mounting it included just a few sentences and a non-detailed diagram on how to ""How to mount the plate"". This was enough info to get a clue as to how to do the mounting (of the bidet seat to the existing toilet), but it still took me several attempts to get all the required pieces bolted down in an order that was fully functional (tight fit to the toilet, and bidet snaps into mounting bracket). Eventually I found a setup that seems to fully work (and I'm guessing was the intended ""correct"" way to mount the bidet), but I could have avoided hours of ""trial and error"" if the instruction manual was simply detailed enough to explain which parts (in which orientations) get bolted to which other parts.

But the third issue (and the one that took the longest time for me to resolve) was that the only supplied plumbing tee joint (this kit has) assumed that your existing toilet plumbing used the same pipe and thread size that the bidet uses (and naturally my existing plumbing used different pipe sizes and threads). This kit did not supply multiple tee joints (which match different existing plumbing fittings), nor did it supply a few adapters (to allow the single tee joint to be used with differing existing plumbing). As a result, I was left to find/buy/install the needed plumbing adapters myself. This was a time consuming (and far from free) process (although the employee at the hardware store did help greatly in identifying which plumbing adapters I needed).

And, of course (just to make the process even slower to complete), all of the plumbing adapter screw joints (to the plumbing adapters I bought at the hardware store) leaked when initially installed. This last issue wasn't really the bidet manufacturers fault (except for the fault of requiring me to get third party adapters to attach the bidet to my existing plumbing), but it did require me to find/buy/use some plumbing joint sealant to fix the leak problems (of course with the covid-19 slowdown in amazon.com shipping, getting the sealant alone accounted for about a week of the install process).

Oh, and as yet another example of poor install instructions, the manual told me to plug the unit in, cover with plastic, and then test all functions (as the final post-install step, before using the unit). I did as the manual instructed and naturally nothing worked. However, when I removed the plastic and sat my bare butt on the unit it worked fine. So the likely reason the ""test"" (the manual itself told me to do) failed was due to the anti-splash sensor built into the unit (which deactivates the unit when someone isn't sitting on it) vs any failure of the unit itself. However, a better written manual could have totally avoided this issue, instead of requiring me (the end consumer) from having to figure this out on my own!

But when all is said and done, I now have a working bidet that does a good job of cleaning my back side (and cleaning both sides for my wife). So my toilet has now been converted from a basic toilet to a full washing (bidet) toilet. Would I buy this unit again? Maybe, as the final result seems to be nice once the install is completed. However, the unit was much more of the ""some assembly required"" cliche then I had expected it would be!"
" The bio bidet bb600 is my first bidet and doing a bit of research online, I wanted to go with a seat instead of the cheap attachment type. My big thing was feature loaded and the bb600 packs a sh*t load of them. The heated seats get pretty hot on the highest setting so I set it medium/low. I’ve been using it so much my leg will get numb from sitting on it. The bidet features an oscillating, aerated, and message feature which is really just oscillating and aerated being flipped on and off. If I feel like I gotta poop, I’ll use the bidet to just lube things up and makes things just fall out. The water pressure is great and can set low or high depending on your preference. I have been playing with the pressure settings and it doesn’t get too hard to where it hurts, makes things super clean and only need 1 or 2 wipes. The air dry feature is ok but doesn’t make it dry dry, still need a wipe after but it does feel nice with the warm air. Installation was easy but I did need to get the genie bidet hybrid attachment for the type of shutoff valve I had. The toilet valve is 7/8th and the T connection that comes with this only has 1/2 on both side. Home Depot was a bust and didn’t have anything to help my type of install but did some searching on amazon and the 7/8th T connector by geniebidet was the exact thing I needed. Checkout my video and you’ll see I didn’t need the 1/2 to 1/2 connector that came with the install package or the T connector since I get the other T valve I needed for my config ( plus now I have another easy shut off valve ). So far no leaking which is good. I did get the 4 year extended warranty after reading the dryer stopped working. It does have a 3 year that the manufacturer covers but I have a feeling the 3-4 year mark something will go wrong. I tried installing a GFI for it but I couldn’t get one that fits my outlet which is beyond me why there isn’t already on in this house I’m at. The manual didn’t say anything about GFI it was only the amazon listing so w/e. My wife or kids haven’t tried it yet, kind of like it that way, it’s like my own little throne haha. My happy place if you will. All in all compared to other models, I’m really happy with my purchase. I think I would’ve regretted getting a Toto. I heard fittings don’t fit as well on that brand. I think biobidet is made in South Korea which is fine. All in all very happy with it."
Our dr. recommended a bidet and this is our 2nd BioBidet. This bidet is a game changer. It is very efficient and effective and does a great job. Highly recommend.
"Firstly, while the product initially meets quality standards, it unfortunately does not have a satisfactory lifespan. The electronics within the system tend to malfunction, causing erratic behavior within a range of six months to a year. Regrettably, the company does not provide any schematics or repair solutions, offering only a reset option that has proven ineffective.
Furthermore, I have noticed that the unit consistently experiences nozzle leakage for approximately 30 minutes after each use. Given the high cost of water in my area, this is a significant concern. When attempting to utilize the product's warranty, I was required to cover shipping expenses amounting to $45 for sending it and an additional $30 for its return. While the product was serviced, the issue recurred after just six months. I suspect that the problem lies with the electronics rather than a mechanical malfunction since it consistently stops after 30 minutes. It is possible that a simple fix or the replacement of an electronic board may resolve the issue, which could be easily performed by a do-it-yourself enthusiast if the necessary guidance and parts were provided.
Unfortunately, due to the lack of viable solutions and support from your brand, I have decided to explore alternatives. I have recently turned to a more traditional brand, TOTO, hoping for a more durable and customer-oriented experience."
"So what are your thoughts on a bidet? Have you ever tried one or do you have one? Does it save the environment? Less paper but more water? Cleaner?

My bottom says yes for the cleaner part. Does it save paper? Of course it does. It saves a lot of trees. Does it use more water? Well let’s talk about that for one moment. The water that is used for the bidet is a lot less than the water used to make that precious toilet paper.
Now last year when the pandemic hit hard, some people were on a mad dash to find those precious squares of the coveted toilet paper. If you had a bidet, you wouldn’t have worried so much about that, but do you need it to dry your bottom? That depends. Our bidet has a dryer. We walk off with a shiny hiney that is cleaner than the Charming Charmin Bear.
What about sanitation? If you are using a bidet with no hands touching that derrière area, there is very little chance of transmission of any bacteria, especially for those that do not wash their hands after the bathroom. Eeewe!

There are many options when choosing a bidet. They range from the simple hand held bidet, about $25, to the much fancier, luxurious, and more expensive options, going up to more than $1000. Most are easy and quick to install.

The choice is up to you.

Below are pics of our bidet and the control arm. We have the Bio Bidet BB-600. You can find it here on Amazon (I receive no compensation for this, just letting you know what we have and where we purchased) https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007HIKQCK/ref=ppx_od_dt_b_asin_title_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1

This bidet also has a kid’s mode for the smaller Charmin bear hiney’s. Some other features include: water, seat and drying temperatures; bidet cleanse; automatic function which does about everything; the drying mode and of course, the emergency stop in case it gets to be too much for you.

So my thoughts on the bidet are….YES! It is amazing!
Give one a try. Save the planet by saving trees. You will have a cleaner than Charmin Clean Hiney.

"I bought this for an older loved one. We all fell in love with it. Yep, in love! It's so much cleaner than toilet paper. No more UTIs for my loved one either. America is way behind on how we look at bidets. You need this! No more stocking up on expensive rolls of tp and now you'll feel cleaner."
This unit exceeds my expectations and was pleased that I was capable of self install.
"Works ok most of the time. Price is what you pay for - cheaper than other models but I'm guessing not as reliable due to cheap parts. Some of the controls only either occasionally work for some reason or never worked at all. Writing this review after using it for over a year.

Water temp - works fine. No issues
Sprayer - sometimes it does not deploy after pushing the button or will only spray for a couple seconds and stop. Same with the ""auto"" setting. Sometimes it just sprays and then stops after a couple seconds and does not cycle though the stages.
Seat temperature - there is no control over the temperature, despite the display showing three levels. Its either off completely or 'blister your behind hot' if you sit too long. I have always had it on the lowest setting and it always gets too hot after a couple minutes.
Air dryer - Has now stopped working entirely.

Unless for some reason I got a faulty model and everyone else has no issues after using it for a year+, I would not recommend buying this product brand. I plan on finding a different brand next time."
"My husband requested I look into this before his shoulder surgery, I did but I have always been a bit skeptical. My son installed it for us. He came home after a 2 night stay and his first words coming out of the bathroom were ""Man, this was the best thing I've could have bought."" He bragged to every family member about his decision and sent them into the bathroom to check it out. This BB600 has been more than just fancy, it allowed him to take care of business. You see, the year before he had a 'reverse total shoulder replacement' after a bad fall (he was 73). The surgery in 2019 was rotator cuff due to constant use of that arm while recovering. Then in 2021 he fell literally blew out his ankle and the rehab was intense, with zero pressure for 90 days. Those incidents sealed the deal on this purchase. The ability to adjust the water temperature, where the water goes, the pressure, the dryer temp has been a powerful help both physically and mentally in that he didn't require my help and retaining his independence was wonderful for both of us actually. BUT, it's also pretty, from my perspective of course.

I do wish there weren't so many seams to keep it clean; but I finally realized that a microfiber cloth works wonders.

Note: The instructions need to be a little more detailed for a 70 yr old woman to follow or provide a link to a video.

We had to add the handicap arms to the toilet and the plate for that leaves some space under the unit and over time, and there were times he had to sit quickly and that created the crack that did it in. Even now, after the 4 surgeries he won't give up the side handles so it would be helpful to have an additional plate that could slip in under the main unit to keep it level.

That BioBidet took a bit of a beating during the following surgeries, a back fusion of 4 discs and then the ankle SO WHEN IT BROKE (our faults not the bidet) HE HAD TO HAVE A NEW one, ASAP! I purchased the BioBidet HD 7000 and he is one happy guy. We have had friends tell us of their bad experiences with other company models. After they sit down on ours their first comment is how secure it feels, the adjustments, the add-ons the look all gets an 'A'. I installed it yesterday. Life is good again."
"We really like this bidet, and this is the 3rd one we have purchased. Upon receiving this 3rd unit, we learned that they changed the wireless remote control, and it is terrible when compared with the previous LCD remote control. This newer remote is not user-friendly, doesn't save our preferences, and the auto button does not operate like the previous remote controls. Looking to see if we can get the old remote control online somewhere, as this new one is not for us."
This model BB 660 purchased in 2020 is better than the newer Bliss model recently purchased. Options are easily used and cleans better too.
"***Update, March 11, 2020 (roughly three months after purchase) the seat is cracking at the back...I guess butt cracks are contagious? So I dropped the review to one star. And we are not highly overweight so this is not good...
***

***Update 2- Their customer service is AWESOME! I called and they are sending out the replacement part ASAP!***

I was recently in Japan and discovered how to ""level up"" one's bathroom game. I had to have one so I read many reviews and settled upon this product. Today, the toilet seat fairy came and I had my work cut out for me.

A few points:
• I gave it four stars because of the power cord. It comes with a ""straight"" plug where an angled plug would make far more sense in terms of aesthetics; if you're plugging this into a wall outlet, the cord protruding out 3""-4"" is a nuisance.

• Speaking of outlets, I had to install a new outlet to accommodate this new unit and I absolutely despise doing electrical. In small tight spaces in fibreglass insulation up to my armpits. I snagged my scalp on a nail too so I'm especially cranky right now.

• And as far as installation, I recommend buying a stress ball or better yet, a heavy bag to relieve the tension you just encountered due to having to install the new outlet, snagging your head on the nail in the roof while you're up to your armpits in insulation and the cut on your scalp is throbbing and you wonder when the last tetanus (tet-ANUS...) shot you had was.

• Once I got as far as mounting the bracket on the toilet to ""snap in the unit"", I realized the ""snap in"" part wasn't snapping. So I had to remove the whole thing, thread up the mounting brackets and ""snap in"" the bottom mounting plate and then thread the posts down onto the toilet. The way to avoid this is to pull the power cord up (like lifting your dog or cat's tail when you're getting ready to plant a thermometer in their bum).

The reason the unit would not ""snap into place"" was the power cord was hindering that process. You wouldn't be able to see this due to the high back of the unit and the close proximity of the rear of the unit and toilet tank.

• By this point, I'm ready to give it two stars... but my wife just discovered the ""oscillating cleanse"" with the ""massage"" feature. I know this, because she yelled out to me how much she loves it. That was roughly a half hour ago and she's still in there. I guess expect a higher than normal water bill is gonna ""come"" attached to this device.

I'm happy to save a tree or three because of the cleansing nature of this toilet seat. My wife will probably have this stupid permagrin on her face all the time now.

I sat down and gave it a spin and that added another star, but no ""happy ending"" for me. I guess they haven't figured out that part yet... or have they? [Opens a fresh tab and heads to 'Zon]

Seriously, get this seat. And a bottle of wine to help you install."
"This a good product. Once you figure out how the nylon bolts fit through the grid on the seat to attach to the toilet bowl, it is smooth sailing finishing the job. The controls are easy to understand, but the best feature is the laminated card that explains all the settings. I would buy it again."
We had this bidet in our last house and loved it. Now that we are in a new home we had to get the same one. It is easy to use and very reliable.
"I awoke one morning to find that one of our toilets - at the lowest point in our house- had backed up spectacularly. I won’t go into the gory details but suffice it to say that it was a multi-hour cleanup. The culprit as determined by our plumber: “flushable” wipes. As it turns out, they may be flushable (so are golf balls, by the way) but if you use them regularly (excuse the pun) they can cause a major problem. This isn’t just a septic system problem - we have city sewer service and the backup was between our house and the street. I couldn’t fathom the idea of going back to dry toilet paper - that just grosses me out - so I tried this. My husband had already made the switch. He got a different brand that was higher rated. I decided to save a little by getting this model and I’m glad I did. I like this one better. It has just as many features - maybe even a couple more - and was easier to install. The only thing his has that this one doesn’t is a remote control. I find the control panel on this model to be easily accessible. And I could just picture a remote getting lost or dropped in the toilet! So I’m feeling “fresh” again and saving money by not buying those expensive wipes. Hooray!!"
"Edit 9/21/2016: So we've had this for around a year, I think. Here's my biggest complaint, and I'm knocking a star off the review for it: IT'S HARD TO CLEAN. They put so many little nooks and crannies under the toilet seat, you practically need a toothbrush and q tips to wipe it down. There is even a crack/seam along the inside edge of the toilet seat - WHO DOES THIS ON PURPOSE? And the directions say you aren't supposed to use any cleaning solutions - are you kidding me? The little sprayers are kinda yellowed, but there's no easy way to clean them - you have to have someone apply pressure to the seat, while holding a cup to catch the water. It ends up looking like we're playing Twister, water-style. The spot where the device sits on the toilet seat - there is no way to clean that crevice without removing the device, and that takes two people. One person to awkwardly hold it in the air, and one to wipe the surface. So after a year of use, there is actually a permanent, yellow stain in the form of a line right there. We removed the seat because we're selling this house, but we can't get the line off.

We both find that we prefer cool water to the heated water, so for the next bidet we get, we're going with the plain cold water kind. Besides, the first water that comes out of the pipes is usually heated to about room temperature in most homes.

THE CORD, oh lordy, the cord! We put this thing in thinking we'd get a GFCI put in. However much later this is, we're still using a darned extension cord. I'm so sick of tripping over and dusting that extension cord, but to get a GFCI put in cost as much as the Bio Bidet (about $350).

Previous review: Well, poops are like 98% less messy now. And being a lady, the front washing part is cool (especially on your period). I'm not all that certain that it's worth that much more money than one of the simpler bidets that cost $30 to $100. Well, maybe it is... It does a bunch of back-and-forth and side-to-side movements, and has a massage setting that alternates the water flow strength, and you can do any combinations of the previous. I don't think the cheaper bidets work on the lady parts. It's actually pretty strong - I've only gone up to 3/5 in water pressure. It does take some getting used to. It took a few days before I figured out how long to wash and with what settings.

The dryer part is pretty dumb. It's like those hand-dryers at stores, where you just keep waiting for drying to happen and it just doesn't. Maybe I'm not patient enough to sit there for the length of time it takes for things to dry.

The heated seat is a little weird. It feels like someone just vacated the toilet seat right before I got on it. My boyfriend really likes the heated seat, though.

The install was difficult. It comes with a non-standard pipe fitting thingmabob, so we had to buy a new valve so it would work (less than $10). The tubing is cheap.

We actually put the elongated seat on a round toilet. We did this mainly because we want to have elongated toilets one day, and don't want to pay for another one of these. It fits okay. The width is about the same as a round toilet, there's just an inch or two of the toilet rim visible in front.

Oh, it comes with a nice laminated user guide. At the top it says ""When you sit on seat, deodorier will start automatically"". What on God's green earth is a deodorier? Is is supposed to say deodorizer? I looked through the entire manual, and found no mention of a deodorizer or deodorier. Apparently some mystical thing happens when I sit upon the seat."
"I replaced my bio bidet with the exact same model because I liked it so much. The other one broke after 4-5 years. The plastics on it got brittle and the lid had chips and cracks in it, and the mechanical part no longer worked. But I felt like it was worth it, and the fitment is perfect on my Kohler toilet."
"The installation was easy once I installed a GFCI circuit in the bathroom - the unit requires 115vac. It works very well and the temperature of the water is perfect. You can adjust the nozzle pressure, temperature and position and seat temperature. You can either turn it off until used again or set it to Economy which leaves the unit in standby until ready to use. The standby mode keeps the seat at the desired temperature all the time whether being used or not.

UPDATE - While on vacation, our neighbor was checking on the house and discovered water in the basement. He found the bio bidet elbow (they call it an L-Valve) was leaking upstairs. He tried to hand tighten the nut and the elbow broke apart spraying water everywhere. He was able to shut the water off but leaking caused slight damage to our hardwood floors and base boards. This had to be a defective elbow to do this. It had not been leaking since we installed it over 6 months ago. Had it not been for our neighbor, this would have been a $10,000+ repair.

UPDATE #2 - I contacted customer support and they are shipping a new L-Valve to me free of charge so I am upgrading my lat update from a 1-Star to 4-Star. This is not a 5-Star because of the failed part."
"This was my first bidet, so I can't say how it compares to any other. With that said, I'm really happy and regret not buying one sooner. I had some trouble installing with the included hardware, because of a leak, I feel like there should have been some kind of rubber washer included for the adapter they included so I ended up going to the hardware store and made my own adapter. Could be problematic if you aren't at least a little bit handy.

As to the function of the bidet, the controls are pretty basic. As of writing this I've been using it for about 8 months.You'll have to play around with the settings to get things to your comfort level, but it certainly has the power to surprise the heck out of you. The heated seat is greaat. The way it seems to work is that while not in use the seat still seems to be heated but just slightly. In the cold season this means if you wake up in the middle of the night or morning the seat isn't going to be cold to the touch. And then as you sit, it will warm up more based on your settings. The warm water function is great too. The water only warms up while you are sitting so the longer you sit, the longer the water has to warm up. On medium settings you'll notice the change in temperature from hot to warm/cooler but it's not uncomfortable.
The drying function doesn't really dry fully on the automatic setting. However, I don't like being on the toilet longer than I have to so I prefer to wipe dry which I don't mind. Plus it's nice to see a damp clean sheet that you discard in case you were ever unsure the job was done right.

Lastly there is a sensor built into the middle left side on the seat (left side if you are sitting on it). This sensor will turn the unit off if you aren't positioned properly. As someone that likes to squat when I go number 2 my thigh will not be on the seat to activate the sensor so I have to rest my hand kind of awkwardly so that way the water and seat will warm up as I'm doing my business.

I feel like they could have built a better sensor.

I don't know of any kind of bidet show room where you can ""kick the tires"" haha, but I would certainly recommend this one to a friend. And 5 stars if there was a better seat sensor, and I didn't have to Jerry rig my installation hardware."
"I installed this bidet in an older relative's house. It looked good, works well, is easy to use . Great things that make me want to give it five stars.

However, two years and two weeks from purchase, one of the hinges on the seat broke. This shouldn't have happened - the device was used by one person of normal weight, the failure was clearly due to a bad materials and engineering choice. But worse than the failure was the pain I had to go through to fix it.

I called the company, was told that I would need to replace the enclosure and they would ship me the part for $45 in 8 days. I confirmed that it was a DYI job and they said yes, absolutely.

Eight days later the part came with no instructions. I spoke to user support again and they sent a single page of instructions that didn't fully make sense and later proved to cover (badly) maybe 10% of the job. I quizzed the very nice user support person on the directions since they seemed off but he'd never actually done the job himself and, as I later learned, had only a very vague idea of how the device was assembled.

Long story short: Their ""absolutely DYI job"" took me two plus hours and required ignoring a ""Caution: Risk Of Electric Shock. Do Not Remove Cover"" notice, pulling out a circuit board, rerouting a number of electronic cables to a second board, dissasembling a pivot mechanism and removing screws that your user support swore weren't there. With no usable instructions.

Note to management: Your product, when working, is excellent and your engineering shows flashes of brilliance. But you need to build your stuff to last. Similarly, I think it's great that you have dedicated support people available but you need to 1. train them so they know the product 2. make sure you have a basic set of documentation prepared so if consumers like me end up doing really deep repairs they know what they are going into 3. have user support available on Saturdays when people are going to be dong this stuff and 4. for situations like mine, where a seemingly minor fix requires pulling apart a ton of mechanical and electronic components either have certified repair available or offer to swap out the entire unit, even for a fee.

With a little tweaking the product and the organization behind it would earn five stars and a rave review, but as-is the unit gets a very generous three stars since two is too harsh and I can't give it two and a half."
"We decided to try a bidet toilet seat last summer. Not wanting to invest in a fancy heated one, we first tried the Luxe Bidet Neo 185 - and were hooked. We were surprised that the water temperature was never an issue, even during the wintertime (the water, after all, was in pipes inside the heated house). Cold, yes, but not intolerable. But we thought we would enjoy a more full-featured one which warmed the water.

When this model came up on a one-day sale, we decided to grab it, for the one bathroom which had an outlet near enough to reach the toilet.

The warm water feature IS nice. It doesn't last a super-long time - but then that's usually not necessary. The air dry function is basically useless, and it smells bad - sort of like an old, not-well-cleaned bathroom. We basically never use that. There's a several-second delay between any change in function - e.g. starting the spray, going from spray to dry, etc.

The controls are very difficult to use. Unless you're very skinny, your body will overlap and they will be tough to reach. The basic buttons (off, back wash, front wash, air) can be located by touch with a little practice, but the others (adjusting aim, temperature etc.) are not usable when you are on the toilet. The inaccessible aiming buttons, in particular, make the seat far less functional than one would wish.

This is not unexpected, but overall is very unfortunate design. Higher-end models with a separate remote might seem silly at first but would really be a LOT more functional than the sort with the controls on the seat.

It comes with a laminated guide to the functions, with a suction cup to attach to a nearby surface (we have it on the outside of our shower door) but the orientation of the guide doesn't match the seat; you have to mentally rotate the image 90 or 180 degrees for the map to be useful, unless you're standing facing the seat.

All in all, I suspect these issues would be found with anything in the same price range. Going up several hundred dollars in price will give you something with a separate remote that would be far more usable, but it may not be worth the extra cost (since those higher-priced models don't really seem to have much in the way of additional features to justify it, aside from that remote)."
"The good:

- heated seat is really great
- seems to do a decent wash job
- easy to use
- easy to install if you have an available GFCI outlet, although the supplied hose is short.

The not-so-good:

- the level controls for water and air pressure make very little difference (no noticeable difference at all for air pressure). Even on the lowest setting water pressure is almost painfully high on 'Cleansing'. The pressure setting does work on 'Auto'.
- the drying function seems fairly useless. Even after two cycles expect to still use TP.
- does not remember the settings for pressure, so every time it starts on level 3 (out of 5) and we have to turn it down to 1 (see first negative about excessive pressure).

Overall I am a bit disappointed but I had high expectations based on the Amazon reviews. I love the concept but this one leaves a bit to be desired.

UPDATE 11/03/2016: we have now had this for about 8 months. The seat now has a nasty discoloration happening (see the photo). During this time the heated seat setting has always been on the lowest level of 3 levels, so if it is caused in part by thermal stress then I would imagine it could have been much worse. Starting to look pretty ugly. You can't just install a new generic seat either as it is an integral part with the seat heater. We'll probably be finding out soon how good that 3 year warranty actually is and I'll report back on that.

UPDATE 11/03/2016: contacted the support e-mail address and after having me sign an at-home repair waiver, they said they will send a replacement.

UPDATE 11/12/2016: replacement seat arrived, so I can vouch for customer service. They replaced just the heated seat, not the whole unit, which is fine, but I did have to sign a release form saying that I would be responsible for the in-home repair. It's possible they would have accepted me returning it to them for repair, but I had insisted they send me a part as I didn't want to be without a functioning toilet, so I never explored that option."
"Product arrived in a timely manner. Installation was fairly simple but took longer than other reviewers mentioned. It took me approximately 45 minutes to remove the old seat and install new bidet and leak test it. I absolutely love the features. I like the seat warmer and the warm water. There is a forward and back adjustment button to adjust the water jet to hit your target. The auto button is nice as it goes through a cycle to hit all areas based on your adjustments and then the air dryer kicks on automatically when the auto cycle is complete. Some reviews say the air doesn't come out very forcefully. Give me a break, it's a toilet seat with not much space to put a bigger fan. To me its just fine and it nice to help dry your bum. Yes, you'll need to use toilet paper to complete the drying of your bum. I can say I use about 1/4 the amount of toilet paper as before and my bum is not chapped from all the wiping. I'd buy it again, although I will the seat cover was a little thicker and didn't feel so cheap. The seat feels fine which is the most important part. Some reviews say they had issues after a few months. I hope it lasts several years to feel like I got my moneys worth. All in all it so far was a great purchase.

Update: 7/29/21
After 9 months I’m still loving it. I will pass up two bathrooms to get to my bidet. Leaves you feeling clean."
We have had one for three years in our master bathroom and the result is our kids only use our bathroom. The heated water and seats are pure heaven. I have had no issues with the first one and now we have one in every bathroom.
"I read a lot of reviews before buying this bidet and felt obliged to add my own experience for others. This was the first time I've ever owned or even used a bidet and so far I am pleased with the result. I've had this installed for a couple months now. The heated seat is nice, the cleanse function works well, and the dryer does enough for you.
One thing I thought a bidet would do is eliminate the need for paper. This does not, but it does reduce the need to just a few squares of TP and the warm water spray leaves me feeling cleaner than when I showed up!
The installation was not really that difficult, compared to other reviews I read. It hooked up to the existing plumbing without a need for any additional adapters than what came in the box. I used Teflon plumbing tape to ensure a tight seal and made sure not to overturn the threads. I got it hooked up without any problems in one try. (Full disclosure, I am an engineer but anyone who can read and follow directions can do this. )
Before I bought this bidet I installed a double gang electrical box on the side of my vanity. I use this for the bidet and other bathroom appliances so it is gcfi and runs seperate from bathroom lighting (as it must according to code). I read a negative review that said their lights dimmed when using this bidet. If you do any electrical work yourself do not wire any receptacle to the lights - this is wrong.
All in all, we've had this for a couple months and so far I'm really happy with it. Let's be honest, owning a bidet is not life changing but it sure beats rubbing paper across your bum!"
"I bought a vacation home and am trying slowly to get it to the way I like it. In my regular home all four toilets have Bo-Bidet 600s on them. Frankly once you get used to warm water washing your behind, its hard to give that up. So among my first projects was to install a GFCI and then put a BB600 on there. I have just done that. Easy install no problem as usual. I am obviously a fan, why am I then chintzy on giving one more star/ Frankly I am not sure its the toilet I should blame or the seat. see All four toilets at my residence are elongated. The ones in here are round. I used them of course before putting the BB - they were ok - although I clearly prefer a elongated one. After I put on the BB, the seating just does not seem right, none of the four touch pads on the seat actually touch the toilet rim and even after I put on the couple of BB supplied sticker pads I put on the front pads. When I seat on it, it seems like the seat is not flat but sloping down to the front and Its hard to get comfortable.. Also have to move the nozzle to the forwardmost position which I have never done on the other toilets. To be honest all of this have been just trials - I will see tomorrow how it works in real use and get back again. I may loosen the bolts again and try to push the whole thing backwards to see if the pads actually make contact with the rim. Stay tuned .

Update. No luck on improving it. It is what it is. Now that I am back home and can put my tush on the elongated toilet; yes, its the toilet shape that is the issue. The other thing I noticed is that new ones do not beep on pushing buttons - the old ones did."
"This is the 3rd bidet seat I have purchased, and the first time buying a Bio Bidet brand. The other unit I currently own was considerably more expensive, and I do like it better because the seat is much larger and more comfortable. But, the Bio Bidet has some strengths. For one, my wife hates the other one because a fan automatically turns on as soon as you sit on the seat, and she doesn't like the noise. I LOVE the fan, though, because it works exceptionally well at odor control. Much better than I expected. The Bio Bidet does NOT have this fan.

The seat issue is my biggest complaint for the Bio Bidet. I'm used to it now, but it is somewhat small compared to what we are used to. I'm also not a fan of how long it takes the water to start after the button is pushed. With my other unit, the water flow is nearly instant after I hit the button, but the Bio Bidet takes a few seconds. Also, I think my other unit has a stronger water stream than this one.

Please understand that you MUST have an electrical outlet installed behind your toilet to power this seat. Otherwise, you will be looking at an extension cord. This is the downfall for all these bidet seats. However, it is WORTH IT! Once you get a bidet seat, you'll NEVER want to go back to a regular seat. And, you'll wonder why you didn't do this much sooner. People ask me if you still need toilet paper, and the answer is yes, but you'll use far, FAR less of it. And, your bottom will love you for it. People seem to be scared, a little, about the water stream, for some reason. No need for concern, tho. And, while it is FAR more than just a heated seat, having a heated seat is fantastic in both summer and winter.

OVerall, I would definitely recommend this unit if you can live with a slightly smaller seat size than you may be accustomed to. The price is definitely right!"
"If you've never used a bidet seat, as we had not, you will be pleasantly surprised, to say the least. It's one of those things that you wonder how you ever got along without. A recent article in the NY Times about bidet seats asked the question that if you came home from work or the gym all dirty or sweaty, would you clean yourself off with paper or would you shower? The answer is obvious and so is the need for one of these. It has loads of options, yet the basics work great. Everything is warm, everything is gentle. It's very popular with family and friends (especially women) and makes for interesting conversation. The sounds coming out of the bathroom the first time someone uses it are, well, something to hear. I used a 3M Command hook to attach their laminated graphical instruction sheet (a huge plus) to the wall next to the toilet, as the provided suction cup hook would not stick to anything.

The challenge with installing one of these is that there needs to be an electrical outlet near the toilet. Our bathroom had none, and I'd be pretty surprised if most people do. So while in the process of replacing the toilet anyway I also installed a new outlet (much easier w/o the toilet in the way). If you don't have such skills (and maybe a dropped ceiling downstairs), you will need an electrician. Plumbing this bidet is trivial.

I almost dropped this review to 4 stars due to second-rate online support. When my bidet arrived from Amazon it was missing the inline filter. I immediately contacted BioBidet via chat and explained I'd just received it from Amazon and the filter was missing. Instead of an apology, I was grilled on where I'd bought it, and had to state three times it was Amazon. Then she started in on a lecture about authorized (which she acknowledged Amazon is) and unauthorized sellers. At that point I got snippy, something I never do, and asked are you going to send me a filter or do I return it to Amazon? Immediately she requested my address and I received the missing filter promptly. But I got no apology for their failure. So the product works great and the missing item was received, and so I give it 5 stars. But online support definitely needs work."
"I did a lot of research before purchasing this model, but after living with it for a couple years I have to say I wish I had gotten something else. It’s got nice bells & whistles but i don’t like using it. The nozzles are placed weird. It makes it harder for my toilet to flush, it’s hard to clean, and quite frankly it wasn’t worth the effort of putting in a separate power source just for the benefit of wishing for something better. Too bad it’s impossible to test run these things."
"I have been asking myself that question for several months now. A bidet is not something I ever thought I would install in my house much less use. After my wife broke both arms we installed one in our downstairs bathroom (different brand but is often compare with this BB model). Months later I decided to test it out... It made me think about installing a second bidet in the bathroom I tend to use...but could I justify the price? After finding it on sale I decided to give it a go.

Install:
Install is pretty straight forward.

Electricity:
The biggest hurdle is probably power. In my case I had an outlet on the other side of the wall near where I needed power. A quick trip to purchase a GFI outlet and old work power box and after cutting the hole and feeding a short length of wire we had power. Not too complicated but many do not like electricity so this step may need a professional electrician...If you have any doubts have one professionally installed.

Water:
Your current toilet has water already attached. Simply turn off the water flush the toilet and remove your existing line. The box came with everything I needed and is setup to accommodate couple different tread options (I needed the adapter). All supplied hoses are good quality and easy to install.

Seat
Easiest part of the project! Remove the two bolts holding your existing seat. Install new seat - hook up water - verify no leaks - turn on. Good to Go.

So is it worth it? A couple hours work, the cost of the Bidet....for me the answer is absolutely. There is a reason why bidets are used all over the world. Definitely worth."
This was our second purchase of this. The last one lasted nine years. This one seems to work just as well. I have not had a UTI since purchasing. It’s so easy to stay fresh and clean with this bidet. I don’t think TP really gets one clean enough. Too bad more of us don’t use bidets as frequently as Europeans. People are so weird about it.we should use them as often as a toothbrush!
"I regret not reading the reviews more thoroughly before buying this bidet; I foolishly thought “it’s the more expensive model so it must be good!” I have learned my lesson. My spouse and I decided to treat ourselves to new fancy bidets after using cheap $25 models for several years. (they got gross, but they functioned perfectly for 5-8 years!!) They weren’t perfect, but I will say at this point I’d PREFER the $25 model to this expensive model. My spouse got this same brand but a model that was about $100 cheaper. I should have just gotten the same model (both for price and that his doesn’t seem to have the issues mine does), but instead opted for this one.

PROS:
- Cleans as intended
- Heated water
- Heated seat
- Self cleaning nozzle

CONS:
- The water pressure is not very customizable and skews towards very strong, even on the lowest setting. My $25 one with a dial (instead of preprogrammed settings) was better for choosing the right pressure. I legitimately feel that the strong pressure has at times made my butt issues WORSE than if I hadn’t used it at all. This model is NOT for you if you have sensitivity issues in that area (cuts, fissures, hemorrhoids, etc.)

- The water settings also default back to the mid range every time, which is incredibly inconvenient and annoying that I have to press buttons 5 times before I can use the washer. Again, the $25 dial model was more convenient than this.

Anyway, I’m now seeing reviews that this model gets more damaged as time goes on (I’ve only had it for less than 6 months) so that’s something to look forward to…😓 So whenever this one dies on me, I’m definitely going back to a cheaper dial-model."
"We have only had this product installed for a day, so my comments focus on our installation and initial experience. Overall, my wife and I are delighted with this product. I spend a lot of time in Japan and am familiar with the local products, and the Bio Bidet meets and exceeds my average experience in Japan. While this product is a bit pricey, it is definitely worth it to have heated water, a heated seat and a drying fan. We have used the $50-type bidet and I didn't enjoy the very cold water (especially in the winter), nor the lack of controls.

This bidet has functions for both men and women, and good adjustments for temperature controls and the position of the spraying nozzle. I really like the oscillating feature which ensures a good, clean result! While I never had a fan function before, I like this one. It doesn't fully dry one's bottom, but does most of the work.

Installation was much easier than I had expected. I'm an average handy man, but this installation took only about 30 minutes and everything worked perfectly from the start! Attaching the seat to the custom frame on the toilet was not easy, but it works.

Another reviewer wrote that he needed plumbers teflon tape, so I bought some and used it. I had no leaks, so teflon tape would be a good $2 investment. All of the other parts were fully provided and worked as planned. The water hoses are at least 12 inches long, so will often need to be coiled behind and under the toilet. This is understandable as some users will need longer hoses, and I, personally, don't find them unsightly. It would be cheap and easy to buy shorter ones.

The instruction manual is quite good, but I would have appreciated a more detailed description of the different parts of this product. For example, it was not obvious to me where to connect the water line to the seat/bidet.

Despite my minor critiques, this is a fantastic addition to our home.

I highly recommend this product."
"I bought the Bio-Bidet in 2018 (for $130 less than its current price). It was a major upgrade from the non electrical bidet I had been using previously.

There are many things I love about this bidet, the ease of installation, the heated seat. At the time it was an economical choice, with not as many options as there are now.

The mechanical part of the seat is still functioning like the day I bought it. The toilet seat, however, is slowly disintegrating. It started with a crack on the under side near the bumper where the seat rests on the bowl. Soon another crack formed. And then another and then one on the other side. Today I discovered a piece of plastic along the rim was cracked. I weigh 170 lbs and am the only user for this seat. It can’t be said that the seat was strained by excessive weight or use.
The last time I checked, just the seat itself was not available to purchase. If it were, and wasn’t too costly, I’d probably replace the seat and happily enjoy my Bio-Bidet. Currently, I’ve got epoxy in the cracks with white tape covering the scars. It’s not pretty but, until the I exhaust my redneck engineering skills, it will do.
I don’t think barely getting 2 years before the thing started falling apart is all that great. If there weren’t so many issues with the seat cracking, I’d probably give this a 4, if not a 5.
But for the price of these things, it really should have held together much longer, and why I’m rating it at 2."
"Had a plumber install appliance. The function keys suddenly stopped working. Company sent a list of things to try, which you might be able to do it you were a plumber. Not able to talk with a person. I weigh 122 pounds and am the only person using the seat, which is showing wear after less than a year. Would not buy from this company again."
"Until recently, I’d never used a bidet. But I tried this one at a friend’s house and was quite impressed. So we bought one.
It was easy to install, just putting a couple of hoses on and running an extension cord to the outlet for power. That is the only drawback. Once you learn the proper settings for you, it is a great thing to have. During these cold winter months the warm seat is so nice to have, especially in the middle of the night.
There are only 3 things that I’m not so much impressed with, and they’re pretty small and aren’t related to the actual function of the bidet:
#1: The seat makes what sounds like a cracking noise whenever you sit down sometimes.
#2. The lid of the seat is sloped, so you are not able to sit on it if you need to, like a regular toilet seat.
#3. This is not really related to the item, but I did not have an outlet near my toilet, so we had to run an extension cord behind the mirror and down the side of the vanity to be able to plug the bidet in.

Overall this is a really great product, and I highly recommend it."
"Very happy with the unit. As I'm on a septic system, reducing the amount of paper that goes down the drain is rather important, and this gets me cleaner than paper could anyway.

A few important points:

1. If you do not have an electrical outlet within about three feet of your toilet, you will need to have one installed. Extension cords are only a temporary fix, and most folks don't want to have extension cords running all over their bathrooms anyway. Installing a new (GFCI) electrical outlet is not a job for most homeowners. Remember. Bathroom. An appliance with water. Electricity. Your backside. Not a good place for amateur electrical work.

2. The plumbing for this is about as difficult to install as a sink faucet. Not hard for some, but if you wouldn't feel comfortable changing out the faucet in your sink, you might consider calling a plumber. Or a handy friend. Oh, and the directions can be a bit obscure. Read them carefully and don't rush.

3. The drying function is enough to get some of the water off, but you'll still need to use a bit of paper to dry yourself fully. The small fan in this isn't anything close to the power of one of those hand drying blowers you see in some restrooms, and even those things don't do a terrific job.

4. This fits on an elongated toilet, but when installed, the seat is much closer in size to the old round standard seats, with the mechanism taking up the rest of the space. Not a problem for me, but it has annoyed some folks.

For me, once the GFCI outlet was installed, it took about an hour to hook up. Since then, it's worked perfectly, and it really does make a big difference, both in the cleaning results, and in reducing the amount of paper going down the drain."
"The Bidet was purchased 3 years ago for two seniors. Just after the 3rd year there was a structural failure of the underside of the seat - note photo carefully (left seat support has major crack and right side (shown with pad removed) is also cracking).

(Others having same problem - pictures show similar failures - indicating design and manufacturing flaws.)

Updated Review Insert

(Temporary Repair Procedure) To be helpful I am suggesting you purchase (on Amazon) a package of Bidet seat pads (becareful not many will work - correct height). Search:

Brand: Abeillo: 20 Pieces Toilet Seat Bumpers, Universal Toilet Lid Bidet Replacement Bumper Kit Silicone Rubber Bumpers for Bidet Attachment with Strong Adhesive for Families, Hotels, School Toilet

BidBidet says they will send be a replacement for the cracked seat, but they are difficult to work with. Not responding to email and on December 30 (Friday) I called and they claim to only be open Monday through Friday - no one answers.

(Long Term Repair Procedure)- Replace broken plastic seat bottom and install additional silicon pads as shown in the second picture. If that does not seem to be enough strength I will add strength to the bottom of the seat using 1/4"" PVC cemented to the plastic and use shorter silicon pads.

Original Review Below:

While I have an engineering background that helped send man into space, others could easily see the plastic is unsupported, a design flaw. There is no supporting structure between the bottom and the top of the seat that one would expect in that the weight of a persons body would be on the top and the opposing support force on the rim of the toilet. If the flaw was on top one might think the something was dropped on the seat to cause the damage, but that is not the case. Also, remember it was not from the seat being dropped because it lowers through supported damping action.

Not sure it BioBidet will stand behind correcting the issue because it was a flawed design in that the warranty has expired. I will try to obtain a replacement for the broken part. (If successful, I will revise this review and note what support was provided to correct the problem.)

Otherwise, I will fabricate and add an internal supporting piece of PVC and do an epoxy repair. I will also not refer others to the BioBidet unless they take responsibility for the flawed design and provide appropriate corrective action."
"Before purchasing this, we (my wife and I) had almost no experience with bidets. But from the research I did, it was clear that we wanted one of the automatic units, not one of the manual ones. Partly that was because I wasn't so thrilled about squirting cold water on sensitive spots. So a bidet that heats the water and incidentally heats the toilet seat is a great thing to have.

I got a terrific deal on an unused but repackaged unit through Amazon Warehouse Deals, saving almost half off. The only problem with our unit is that the box had been slightly damaged.

Installation was straightforward, despite the apparently translated-from-Chinese user manual. I am almost entirely without plumbing skills, yet I was able to install the unit in about 90 minutes. The only tools I used was a screwdriver and adjustable crescent wrench, and I could probably have done without the screwdriver. Keep the wrench nearby for a day or so in case a connection needs a little tightening. On the other hand, some of the threads are plastic, so use that wrench to make things no more than very finger tight; don't overtighten.

In operation and daily use, the unit is straightforward and enjoyable. It takes a little while to get used to the different modes, (again because of the user manual), but the unit greatly diminishes the amount of toilet paper you will use. You're still going to need some, because the hot air dryer doesn't always completely finish the job, but that was as expected from reading the other reviews. As I write this in December, we have the unit in Economy mode, which keeps the seat not-cold, but not toasty warm. In Normal mode, the seat is refreshingly warm when you sit down. We've only had it a couple of weeks, but consider it a good purchase."
"We ordrered two of these (same part number, etc.) and now that they are installed, we love having them. The bidet itself has lots of features and is easy to use, as well as install.
While Amazon is usually pretty easy to work with and consistent, for this item, both of them that we received had clearly been ordered and returned by someone else previously and were not repackaged very well at all. My guess is someone didn't know how small the seat is on a standard bidet, pulled it out of the box and was shocked, then returned it. Neither item looked as though it had been installed but all the parts had been rifled through and then tossed back in the box with little care - including the main section itself.

Another issue we had is even though we ordered qty 2 of the same item, we received two different sizes of the bidet - one is significantly longer (both are SUPPOSED to be elongated) than the other. At this point, they've both been installed and used so on an item such as this, I couldn't imagine returning it after install. So I'm pretty disappointed by Amazon's performance on this order.

That said, we do love our BioBidet units as it is a nice bidet solution for the money.
Oh - the ""Review"" entry asked me to rate the remote control... Neither of our BD600 units came with a remote in the box, so either they don't come with one that I can rate, or we were shorted parts after all."
"This is a ""first timer's"" male experience. I've never had or even used a bidet (I had some probably unrealistic expectations).
Installation was straightforward, although consider this unit needs a plug to heat the water and seat. I needed an extension cord, no big deal.
Things I like: warm water is key. The first time I tried it I didn't have the heater on. Wow that'll wake you up.
A clean bum. It's super nice to have a wash instead of smearing everything around with tp. Be real, no matter how many times you wipe, it's not as clean as a wash.

Things I don't like (or, my expectations were out of line):
1) you still need tp. Unless you want to sit there for fifteen minutes waiting on the dryer to gently evaporate the water, you need tp to dry.
Speaking of the dryer, blowing stanky toilet air around is not pleasant. Just skip the dryer.
2) sometimes it doesn't get everything, but you're going to use tp to dry anyways. No big deal.
3) it's overpriced.

Overall 4 stars, even if it's mostly psychological I enjoy a washed bum! Not sure what the fix is for including drying, maybe team up with Dyson."
"Having lived in Japan, I experienced what it was like to have a nice bidet and greatly missed it upon my return to the States. For a while, we used a basic non-heated bidet which you can find online for $50 or less. I got the BB-600 on a Treasure Truck deal and was very pleased to find that the quality of the installation parts was much better.

The seat works well. We keep it on the lowest heat setting for the water and don't bother with the heated seat as it's not really necessary here in Florida. As other reviews have said, the water pressure can be pretty high if you aren't used to it, but I find that the first or second setting are plenty, especially when you use the ""aeration"" and ""massage"" features.

My only complaints are that the power cord is too short, so I used an extension cord to connect to our GFCI outlet, and that the dryer function doesn't work too well. The air doesn't come out too warm or forcefully so it takes a couple of cycles and even then I sometimes need a couple of squares of toilet paper to be totally dry. Overall, we are quite pleased.

One other comment: If your toilet is fairly high off the ground, the seat does add a couple of inches of height, so take that into consideration. You may want a step/stool or something, depending on your setup."
"I absolutely love this thing!! This was a life changing purchase for me!! It is super simple to use and the water warming is such a nice feature. For anyone out there who might be suffering from chronic urinary tract infections, BUY ONE OF THESE!!!! I suffered from such chronic UTI's that I was on antibiotics monthly for an entire year. I saw a urologist, tried multiple drugs, drank tons of lemon water, took cranberry, everything and anything I could think of to make it stop. I did some research and found that having a bidet can greatly help if you have that problem and so I bought this and it seriously changed my life!! I haven't had a single infection since purchasing this thing!! My urologist never mentioned this would fix it, never even suggested it. I know there are tons of women out there who suffer from chronic UTI""s just like me and if you do, buy this!! It will seriously change your life. I will never ever go without a bidet again!! I have since bought a less expensive bidet for my kids bathroom because they were constantly wanting to use my bathroom so they could use the bidet and the less expensive one I bought is not nearly as good...the water is freezing and the stream is a bit rough if I do say so myself....as in if your're not careful you just might give yourself an enema! The BioBidet is so much better! It warms your seat, warms the water, and is so easy to control. There are settings specifically for women and there is even a kid setting. The only down side is you have to have a plug behind your toilet. It was no big deal for us because we were able to run an outlet from a plug directly on the other side of the wall but for some people that might not be an option so just something to know if you are interested in buying this. Love love love this product!!! If I could give it 100 stars I totally would!!"
"Installation: my head may have been in a different zip code when I started the install. I thought I might have to go to the hardware store to pick up a fitting or two to make up the plumbing connections, but it turned out that everything necessary was included in the package. Yay. It took about 40-minutes to complete the install, perhaps because I was not in a hurry. I added some Teflon tape to some of the fittings because leaks are a bummer and some of the reviews indicated a problem with that. Overall, an easy install for me.

Operation: our unit does not have a remote. The controls function as described but you may have to adjust your position to achieve a bulls-eye. We use the Economy setting on the power switch which is fine for about 95% of the time. If I'm going to use the unit within 5-minutes I may bump it up to the full ON setting to warm the water up a little more ahead of time which is nice. The heated seat is a nice feature too. The temperature setting is ""medium"" which for us is nice on a cool morning.

So far, we're about three weeks into the use of the Bio Bidet and my spouse and I appreciate what it does, wondering why we didn't do this some years ago. Would I purchase again? Yes. The one thing that I plan to do from here is to plumb the bidet's input from our sink's hot water valve rather than the cold water for the toilet. That should facilitate a warmer wash, should we need a little extra cleansing time.

I expect to update this review in six months or so to share how the unit is performing over time."
"I have used this product since 2012 (at my old residence) and then purchased a new one in April 2021. That unit began to leak after a few weeks. I returned it after I got the new one and the same thing happened with it too. I then returned it and got another replacement (3rd one) and it was fine too until a few weeks past. I had a hard time believing that +$300 for this product that it could leak period but especially three in a row! I did some research and found that I was not the only one to have this issue. Mounting the seat too far back on the toilet can cause it to 'drip over' and then puddle at the base of the toilet. I moved my seat further forward to see if this was the issue and by doing so reduced the size of the elongated toilet and it still leaks over. It is not that hard to mount the seat and plum it, what is a pain is to have to keep doing it and then drive to the UPS store to return that faulty unit. I have began another return (4th one) and will update this post after confirming it does or does not leak. Hoping it does not and if it does I will simply return the product and go with a different manufacture. (By the way, my initial one never once leaked, it did have the aeriation feature stop working but that was it, loved it). Thinking that quality control may have slipped over the years??"
"Bought one a few years ago that is leaking from the drain hole. There is a drain bolt but it doesn't turn. I contacted support and they gave me a list of things to try which did not work. I asked them not to close the ticket but they closed it, and the problem is not resolved. It is not under warranty any more but the warranty is only 2 years. Anyway, support does get back to you but it there is any back and forth the ticket is lost. I need a new bolt, and they stopped responding. Waiting to hear back, waiting for a bolt, something. Ended up buying a new one since it is a great item up to the point where it started leaking from the drain. Will probably just end up contacting sales/ parts and have a new bolt sent because this has been dragging on for way too long. I'm not angry or anything, I just want this issue resolved. Maybe I'm being too nice so i'm at the back of the line - but support is lacking."
We bought these new at a home improvement store for 3 bathrooms in our house. All three failed in the same way at about the 3 year mark. This could be an effect of high water hardness in our area (well water).
"I was very happy to find a Bio Bidet seat that would fit our round toilet, and for a reasonable price. I had to do a little retrofitting because it was not perfect for our Toto brand toilet, but we made it work by putting heavy duty 3M double faced tape under the bar that you slide the toilet seat on to. I don't know why everyplace in the U.S. does not have bidets. They are such a sensible item. We had one before for my elderly mother who lived with us before she died and it was a real godsend. Now as we are aging, it is wonderful for my husband, almost 90 and me, 82, but frankly, I wish they would have been available for my children growing up. This one even has a special children's setting. Bio Bidet provides great customer service. They will help you with installation over the phone, and when we originally had a tiny leak where ours connected to the water shut off, they sent us a new set of hardware free of charge just in case that was the problem. It actually was that we were no longer strong enough to tighten it up and just needed someone with a stronger grip to do it for us. You really can install this yourself if you are strong enough and agile enough to get into what might be a narrow space. The quality of all the parts appears to be outstanding. I would suggest BioBidet over something less expensive, and I'm happy not to have the remote control unit. The controls on the unit next to the toilet are really easy to understand and to operate with just a touch of the finger. I don't think any home should be without at least one of these units!"
"UPDATE: After using this 3 months, I have updated my comments.

This has design flaws for women. Could definitely be better designed.

Pros:
Seat warmth is great and adjustable
Great for cleaning one’s bum
UPDATE: It’s brilliant to have now with the COVID-19 panic toilet paper shortage, because I use 3 squares for a pee and about 5 for the other — so we use less than 2 rolls a week for 2 of us. So bidet toilet seats are awesome!

Cons:
*Air dry is cold (no temperature control) — CORRECTION: after 3 months, I discovered the air temp control (which doubles as controls for other features). It feels like it heats the seat up more and eventually sometimes it feels like the air gets warmer but not by that much. I don’t usually want to sit there long enough to see if it gets significantly warmer.

*Air dry doesn’t reach the front at all!! This is my experience with a round toilet. (My friend has it on an elongated toilet which has more space in front and she says hers dries the front)

It wasn’t super easy to install but my husband managed after wrestling it for an hour or so.

Cold air on the bum is tolerable, but it’s *very* uncomfortable on lady parts!!

If you use the bidet button it washes the front (including hair), but the dryer doesn’t reach anywhere near that, leaving you sopping wet!!

WORK AROUND: Avoid moving the bidet nozzle all the way to the front, so it washes the important bits without drenching the hair.

The warm water on both functions runs out pretty fast. Which is more tolerable on the bum, but really not great for us ladies!

Air temp and front drying on a round toilet are definitely poorly implemented (at least for a woman’s body).

I’d love to try a better designed/implemented version of this designed more with the female body in mind!"
"I became a bidet ""convert"" 5 years ago when my wife made me buy a Toto washlet bidet for around $500. Bidets are awesome little devices that make the common American practice of ""dry wiping"" seem downright medieval, especially if you suffer from hemorrhoids or anal fissure. It's funny to hear me bandstand at parties sometimes, talking-up the benefits of a ""wet wash"" vs. a ""dry rub"", with people staring wide-eyed and quizzically fearful at the notion of using water to clean feces off of skin. Anyways, this Bio-Bidet BB-600 I got for $349 here on Amazon is what my wife refers to as her long awaited ""upgrade"" from the aging Toto, which still works fine but lacks the auto-rotating head (massage) feature and some other bells and whistles and now migrates to my daughter's bathroom (she is thrilled). It was easy to install with no tools (well, OK I used some channel locks to go a bit more than hand tight on the water supply connection), and took about 15 minutes. I watched the BioBidet installation video at [...] first, and the unit shown was similar enough to the BB-600 that I didn't do more than glance at the installaton instruction sheet that came with the unit. The bidet fired right up, worked as advertised, made my wife happy. Installed three days ago and so far no problems. If I do have any issues I will update this review. 4 stars because I think the seat quality is a little low (plastic) and the quick reference guide could do a better job describing the features (there are a lot of buttons!)."
"Have had this for ~8 months now. I love to be lazy, and the fact i can push a button to clean the whale eye is amazing. No more smearing booty meat with TP thinking i was clean. It was an adjustment at first, as i had to get used to the sensation and pressure of water cleaning my rear. I found that using the ""front butt"" clean set to the lowest pressure and moved back to the shortest length, i was able to gradually graduate up to the ""back butt"" clean at full intensity. Whenever there is just massive collateral damage, i push the back butt button twice and it cleans in a fairly large swath to quickly return the starfish and surrounding area to pristine condition. The hot water doesn't last very long, but i found this not to be an issue. My only complaint is the extra time it takes to clean vs a dumb seat, but this is trivial compared to the service it provides. About 2 months after purchasing, nature called while at work. The shock to my cheeks of sitting on a cold seat was like being stabbed with a dagger of ice, compounded with 10 stressful minutes of relearning to use TP and spending the rest of my shift second-guessing the quality of clean i had achieved. EVERYONE needs a bidet. Its so much cleaner, easier and hygienic. Best of all, you literally push a button for clean, no more lifting a cheek and performing tedious, often dirty, manual labor yourself."
"Great bidet for the price. I like the heated seat is always on/ready. Two different wands for regular cleanse and fem cleanse including massage/aeration features. Water pressure is good. Water temp is warm upon use. This replaced a Coco that had a cracked seat corner. This seems to be sturdier and is also a flatter seat (vs. tilted Coco). Also has a soft close seat.

PS - There is no remote control. It's controlled via side panel."
"Pros: seat warming is AWESOME in the winter especially. And the water warming for the bidet is nice, and seems well-aimed (though toward the end of the stream, the water will begin to cool as it exhausts the pre-warmed reservoir water). Dryer is ok but not exceptional.

Cons: does require an electrical outlet near the toilet (we had this in only one batroom, so only have that one bidet seat). The back of the seat has the bidet wands built in, shrinking the ""poopable"" size of the hole. Could especially be a problem if you were doing a drunken standing pee as there is just a smaller target zone. Also, the seat seems to have a slight lean forward, so it could get uncomfortable if you like to sit and watch YouTube for 20 min while you make fudge dragons.

But overall i like it."
"In the four years this bidet has gotten a lot of use. Every function still works as well as it was when originally installed. This is the type of quality a person hopes for when buying a product. There are newer models, but I cannot review those because the one I have is still as good as when purchased."
I used my bidet for the first time today and must say this is the most impressive feat of human engineering to date. Easily worthy of the Nobel if I must say so myself. Never had a better experience in the bathroom and look forward to enjoying my new life.
"I have bought two of these. It seems after a year or two these things start to fall apart. My first one - the seat no longer has the gentle closing and just slams shut - this happened after 2 years. A year later there now is a leak from the tank that has developed, so I am going to have to replace the unit. It's been 3 years and now I am left holding the bag on a product that was not built to last and is clearly faulty.

I cannot recommend a product that costs this much, is prone to fail, and only offers a 2 year warranty. I would advise spending more money on a more reliable product.

I will update my review pending my interaction with CS.

UPDATE: Bumping up a star. After my interaction with customer service, it became apparent the leak was NOT from the bio bidet like I thought, just a loose connection somewhere. That said, the lid is still broken just from normal use.

It is worth noting I own two of these, the other has had no issues yet."
"Pros:
- Came with a good amount of parts and instruction for installation
- Seems reliable so far
- Good amount of options and features

Cons:
- The seat could be more comfortable. It's hard plastic and very tall for the width, making one's legs fall asleep sooner than if it was padded and/or more ergonomic.
- Some of the options reset each time you stand up, while some don't. The most problematic thing that resets each time is the water pressure, which really I only ever want on the lowest setting. So every time I use it, I have to lower the pressure before choosing the spray option.
- Even at the lowest pressure setting, it's still too strong a lot of the time. I can't even imagine using the highest setting—unless I need paint removed or diamonds to be cut.
- It would be nice if there were more nozzle options to vary between comfort and cleaning power.
- Apparently there is only a seating sensor on the right side, which is a problem for children who don't weigh enough to distribute enough pressure across the seat. They need to lean on the right in order for the seat to respond.
- Due to the shape of the unit, the front to back size of the opening is smaller than the seat this is replacing. I have an oval bowl shape for comfort and this seat reduces that.
- The dry option has never smelled okay from the first day and doesn't really do much drying. I stopped trying to use it pretty soon."
"We are seniors who have both been surprised by health issues this year (not COVID). We are at the point of needing to recognize and do something about the little things that affect our health -- because little things often affect major organs. Damn.

So, we determined one problem solver was to switch to a bidet. And this particular one is now on sale because an update is available. But we checked out the new one and found this one still had everything we were looking for.

Let me tell you -- there is nothing quite like sitting down on a soft warm surface for a change. Add to it the cleaning features, which are shockingly perfect, as well as the final step of a gently warm drying -- and I am so sold on this!

I should mention that we do not own the home where we live -- we are simply renters, who may be needing to move at any time (especially because the price of rent is increasing by leaps and bounds in this area) -- but we know that this unit was easy to install - and will be easy to uninstall and take with us -- without any structural changes made to this rental unit. That, too, is a definite plus."
All I can say is I wish I got it decades ago. I want on a week vacation recently and I missed it :)
"I purchased this unit two-plus years ago and my wife absolutely loves it. While it is easy to install and easy to use, it is not easy to fix. This past spring, shortly after the warranty expired, the seat heating mechanism stopped working. Despite the expired warranty, Bio Bidet was generous enough to sell me a new seat at a VERY discounted rate. Upon installing the new seat, I noted that the holes on the main body of the bidet, where the seat bracket attaches to, had started to crack. We used the seat for a few more months until ultimately those holes failed and I ended up replacing the housing as well. Subsequently I have had to disassemble and reassemble this unit twice. Unfortunately the lid now no longer fully opens (instead it rests on your back when you are seated. gross.)/ Also the slow-closing mechanism no longer functions, and instead the lid slams shut. I think I am a pretty good home mechanic and I do not think these units are durable enough to be DIY fixable. We are about to purchase a replacement but are unlikely to purchase again if the replacement fails as quickly."
"I just love this addition to my newly remodeled bathroom. Now that winter has begun it's even more wonderful with the warm water wash and the warm seat option makes my time on the seat so cozy I don't want to leave or use a bathroom other than this one with my bidet seat. The warm air blower unfortunately really doesn't dry your bum much unless you've already did it some with a cloth. That's my only negative about it..Oh, also, I at times don't like that the lid is sloped and you can't sit on it or set things on it that could roll off. It would be nice to have the control pad with a backlight so that you can see what you're doing in the middle of the night without having to turn on extra lighting or just use the Braille method as it is also hard to exactly feel which button you are wanting to push.maybe if there were more dots on it or something that you could feel better the off button seems to have a bump on it so you know where that is and it's at the end of the line so it's easy enough to find it in the dark but..."
"For years, I'd heard about bidets, and how they are better than regular toilets. Also, it's been claimed that bidets are better for the environment than toilets. This bidet toilet seat has all of the features that I need and it's easy to understand and use. It's comfortable and attractive."
"After a recent week stay in Kyoto, I found myself wondering why we didn't have one?

This does it all, at half the cost of the Toto brand seat which was in our airbnb house. Seat warmer,
pulse, massage, etc (albeit it does not play a little song -- and I'm OK with that). It's truly wonderful, and I will never live without one again.

Note -- when I looked at it on Amazon, they recommended I buy a special valve by KES to hook it up.
That turned out to be completely unnecessary -- everything needed for installation, was in the box
except some teflon tape to assure threaded connections are water-tight..

The supplied hoses WERE unnecessarily long. If you want a nice, sanitary looking installation and your plumbing
stub-out is right next to the toilet (as most are), you'll want to get a 1/2"" FIP to 7/8 (toilet fill valve)
hose about 12"" long, and a 1/2"" FIP to 1/2"" FIP hose, also 12"" long, instead, so you don't have loops of hoses
|all over the place.

The first hose goes from the supplied dual outlet shutoff valve to the toilet fill valve. The second goes from either the
second outlet on the supplied shutoff valve directly to the 90 degree fitting supplied with bidet seat, OR you can
thread a CF100 BioBidet filter onto the second outlet and run the hose from the far end of the (disposable, six month)
filter to the bidet seat itself.

On inquiry, BioBidet told me they don't recommend a filter unless you have very hard water, but I figure with warmed
water passing through small nozzles, why not?

All in all, this is simply civilized, and you'll thank yourself daily for having purchased and installed it."
"I can’t even remember what life was like before. I bet this is how the machines take over. I wouldn’t wear a VR Headset and sit on this because that’s how they get you defenseless to put you into the matrix FOR SURE.
The heated seat is worth every penny. The heated water is like- heavenly. The auto function has a massage setting and it is just- another level of life that I didn’t know existed.
The BLOW DRY FUNCTION! Is pretty cool but takes a while to fully dry off. But it is an act of radical self care. To allow the full blow dry cycle to complete takes time- but it is time you should carve out for yourself a couple times a day.
The one thing I will say is that it’s a little bulky and you can’t really sit on top of it with the lid closed and I spend more time wiping it than myself. Keeping it clean isn’t hard but there are some grooves I find myself wondering if are necessary as I’m cleaning the unit. Overall I would say this is life changing and I’ve been physically happier since I’ve owned it."
"At long last we purchased a bioBidet BB-600 and we both love it. It was exactly what we wanted -- warm water, heated seat, warm air dryer, etc. It was very easy to install. Our recommendation is not to wait as long as we did to make your purchase. It is a slightly awkward to reach the controls on the side of the seat, but you get used to it and it is easy to use. We love our bidet and may even purchase one for our guest bathroom."
"For the most part I am pleased with my bioBidet. It was recommended by my Dr to help with better cleanliness do to surgery that has left scaring .
I live in a warm climate so not all the features are needed, ie. The heated seat . It would be helpful if the control were illuminated when you sit down.
I am an 84 yr. young female and installed my Bidet by myself. I did find the instructions to be difficult to follow, the pictures are so small it was hard to determine the up and down of things. It took me 2 hrs. to figure out, but now understanding it If I were to do again it would take me no more than 30-45 min. Full installation and no leaks. ( I also installed the 3 way T Adapter at the same time)"
"I am sure that with the right setup it might be possible to install this yourself. Unfortunately, while many bidet's are designed to install the T-Valve at the top of the hose that comes from the Stop Valve and right before you go into the top tank of the toilet, this model expects the T-Valve to be installed before the hose comes from the Stop Valve. So ended up needing a plumber because while I've replaced the Toilet kit several times the hose would not budge.

Once installed, the bidet added a bit of height which my SO was actually looking for, although the overall impression is that a hulk has taken over part of your toilet. IOW, be aware this is a sizeable addition and no one will think this is just a toilet with a few extra features.

Given all the functions on the control panel, I was surprised that while I could add a massage or program special cycles of cleaning and drying, there is no function to move the jet from side to side. So you end up doing a little scooting around if you want to make sure you hit the entire area that may need cleaning.

Jet does a bit of a purge before each cleaning session which is probably a good idea, but means it sometimes seems like it has started and stopped before it's really started. Took me a few times to convince myself not to try to get up a bit to look - because then the sensor sees you're no longer on the seat and auto-shuts.

Is it a reasonably good bidet for the price? Yes. But while it it noticeably better than some of the $30-$40 bidet attachments on here, it still comes nowhere close to a full bidet experience. As long as you set your expectations properly, you'll probably enjoy using this."
"Overall the product was easy to install with the attached instructions. From the time I opened the box to installation was about 30 minutes (with the exception of the water lines). The water connections proved a little frustrating with the long lines provided with the product. It required additional loops to make them fit and it took another 30 mins with new washers to stop all the minor drips. Toilet connections are notoriously troublesome, so this was expected. The biggest issue involved the length of the warranty. Amazon listed the product with a 2-year limited warranty however the manual that came with the product listed a 3-year warranty (100% first year, 75% second year and 50% in the third year). I registered the product with the company and discussed this issue and they reported it must have been a ""typo"" in the manual, however they did agree to honor the 3-year offer. Overall I like the product."
"I rarely leave reviews but having just encountered this issue which Amazon resolved and was awesome, I feel the need to spread the word. From Bio Bidet direct, there are only 2 authorized sellers on Amazon. If you order from any seller other than those (you have to ask Bio Bidet about the seller at the time of purchase), then you item is not covered under warranty and you are left stuck. Within 90 days on our unit, the seat cracked at the back. Bio Bidet says there is a 400 lb weight limit. My wife and I do not weigh over 300 combined, so there is no way our weight should have cracked the seat.

if you go on Bio Bidets website for replacement seats ($70), you will see lots of complaints and reviews about the seats cracking. Bio Bidet only has a 1 year warranty so anything after that, you will be replacing seats at your cost. Based on that, I would almost lean to recommending a Toto instead. Yes they are insanely expensive, but at least they don't break.

Update: Bio Bidet and Amazon have been in contact with me and both have gone above and beyond to make it right. While I am still worried about the seats lasting, I will say both companies have been great to work with. For that, I will bump it up a star."
"About 2 years in and in the 3rd lid. Hinges keep cracking under no pressure. Cheap plastic parts crack frequently. Not a bad deal for the price, but for the long term, I’d go with a higher quality brand."
Absolutely love this product. It was very easy to install and works wonderfully. The heated seat is legit and overall it is very easy to use.
"Just purchased 3rd 600 for new toilet. Have had two for 5 years they are great save on toilet paper bunches. Cleaner with water wash with warm water and warm drying fan love heated seat. Easy to install. Recommended by doctor to be more sanitary for your bottom
Hate to have to go to places that don't have one. Just spoiled my wife and I pluse friends that come to visit"
"Overall, the seat is working as expected.
I purchased a 'Used - Very Good, Item has no cosmetic scratches or blemishes. Comes in original packaging. Packaging will be damaged.' from Amazon Warehousedeals.
When the package arrived, there was a minor scratch on the seat and only one hose. The Operating Instruction Manual says there should be 2 hoses. There was a T fitting but nowhere in the instructions does it say what the T fitting sizes are nor what the seat fitting size is.
The Seat that I received has a 1/2"" faucet and the T is 1/2"" for all 3 connections. A standard toiled has a 7/8"" and the wall cut-off is 3/8"". The one hose I received was 1/2"" to 1/2"" so it worked for the connection from the T to the seat. Not wanting to wait to see what Amazon customer service would do, I purchased a 3/8"" to 1/2"" hose, discarding the original 3/8"" to 7/8"" hose, and purchased a 1/2"" to 7/8"" hose.
The toilet we have is a 2 year old American Standard Elongated. The seat attachment bolts are long Teflon bolts. I had to cut one because it hit part of the tank under the back.
So be prepared as you might have to make some modifications and purchase other then normal wall to toilet hoses after you match up the seat to your toilet."
"I love this product. I don't know why my doctors have not prescribed this product for me. I used to itch soooo badly after going to the bathroom. This has reduced this issue by so much. Instead of taking steroid creams or washing with special soap, now I just sit on the bowl (blissfully heated seat I might add) and wash away the itchies. I do wish I could get the drier going on a higher, more forceful speed -- like the hand dryers in public restrooms.

As for the installation -- as someone who doesn't have a background of being handy or installing things I was a little stumped at two points. It did take me some hours to install the Bidet, but now that I know what I know, I could install a second one in probably 45 minutes. The company's you tube video was very helpful in ways that the booklet was not. The video was not helpful when it came to connecting the water, but between the instructions, several helpful customers who posted you tube videos, and my housemate pointing out that I hadn't connected the water correctly (which in hindsight was really obvious), it's working perfectly - not a hitch.

Granted it's new (only three weeks of use), but I am super happy with the purchase. It's working like a charm."
"So, I took one star off only because if you are putting this on a Kohler toilet it could be a bit of a pain in the keister. Kohler has a proprietary way of attaching toilet seats to their bowls. Instead of a nylon bolt and nut that are accessible, they use a metal expansion bolt that fits into a blind indentation into the porcelain. That expansion bolt is metal, and particularly with chlorine in bowl cleaners, has a tendency to rust. Even without the rust it requires a special tool (25$). When rusted it may need to be CAREFULLY drilled out. Once that is done, you must deal with the supply line. Again Kohler supply is not accessible without pulling up the toilet, so a special adaptor is needed to attach the bifurcated supply line. That being said, once installed I love the seat, it is so nice to sit on a warm seat and the cleansing functions are more hygienic and in the long run no more expensive than toilet paper."
"Love this seat! As a male, I was skeptical to try. Now I dread staying at hotels without a bidet. My bhole has never been happier. The warm seat is also nice. The fan is a joke though, feels like somebody warmly breathing you your bum."
"After reviewing many reviews and comparisons here on Amazon and Youtube, we went ahead and bought one. Installation was pretty easy, we did have to buy a 7/8"" to 1/2"" connecting hoses from toilet tank to connect the 1/2"" Tee adapter, it's less than $5 from HomeDepot. The unit works great, the dryer is a bit on weak side but not a big concern to us. Do make sure you measure your existing toilet dimensions first before you buy one. After using it for 1 week, our family liked it very much and we bought 2 more, so every bathroom in the house has one now. We especially appreciated those who shared their experiences on comparing the BB-600 with other Bio Bidet models, the more and less expensive ones, I believe BB-600 may represent the best overall practical functions and value for average daily users. Another note is you will have to call the manufacturer to register your product since the warranty registration card doesn't come with the original box, BB-600 has a 2 year warranty, All they need is your proof of purchase, I sent them all my Amazon purchase invoices and they emailed me back within 15 minutes to confirm the warranty registration. The customer service people at Bio Bidet are excellent, they were very patient, helpful and truly a pleasure to talk to."
"I bought my bio bidet 2/15/15, now it’s been over 5 years and I still LOVE it. I initially purchased as I had a back fusion ( that was very successful -saving my life) and needed this! I recommend it so much. If I travel, I even find myself looking for hotels that offer bidets. This has been the best purchase I have ever bought and for over five years no issues at all. I am just now noticing the water is not as strong and felt as if it is time to replace after five years. I may just put this one in another bathroom after removing. I installed this all alone and even had a plug installed close by in my last home, because it is such a necessity. If you want to feel cleaner than TP or if you have had surgery as I did, this is really the most useful thing I can recommend. When in Japan I used Bidets ( everyone has one there) and am so glad I remembered using them there and bought this when I did! I cannot say enough great things about this. Price is very fair and the product is amazing. Thank you for making these so easy to buy and install. I LOVE my bio bidet."
"I installed this unit myself. I had to wire a GFCI outlet into the bathroom; an outlet on the opposite side of the wall made this fairly easy. This gave me the opportunity to put a night light in the bathroom at the same time. Don't do this if you don't know what you're doing! The plumbing proved a bit troublesome as my existing valve had a hose directly connected to it, so I had to replace the entire valve stem. This meant a trip to Lowe's and $10 worth of parts, but once I got it together it's been leak-free. The instructions don't mention what to do if you have this type of valve, so if you're not sure, get some advice.

My main concern with the seat is its length. Although I ordered the elongated seat, as you can see from the picture it is still an inch or two short. This is not a problem for me or my wife as we are not large people (I'm 6' 175#), but I think for anyone who is overweight the small size of the seat could hinder proper operation.

That said, the seat works really well for us. I bought it because I am having a coccygectomy and need to take special care when cleaning my ""undercarriage,"" and for this purpose I give the seat an A+."
"I just installed several days ago and I can say so far, so good. I don't think this is a replacement for toilet paper but it does make you feel much fresher after use. Installation was very easy however I did have an issue with the pullout type water outlet installed in my home. The contractors who built the home used the single piece pullout valve with non-removable hose line to the toilet tank. I had a simple and cheap fix for that with a ten dollar adapter (KES SOLID Brass T-adapter with Shut-off Valve, 3-way Tee Connector for Handheld Bidet 15/16"" and G 1/2 Polished Chrome, K1018-CH) which actually made installation even a bit easier with one less line to install. Toilet size is something to take into consideration also. I'm a athletic 200 pound guy and the seat is slightly small for me but not uncomfortable at all. The heated seat is a big winner on this product as well!
UPDATE - SEPTEMBER 2019 - A little over a month of ownership now and I can still say, 'wow, should have gotten this years ago!' The biggest surprise is my wife, who was very skeptical of the purchase, even telling me I should return it before I even installed it, she is now a big fan of the Bio Bidet! Two happy customers here :)"
"THIS IS ADDES 3.5 YEARS LATER. I JUST ADDED ANOTHER STAR. IT IS STILL WORKING AS WELL AS EVER. I AM VERY PLEASED. USED DAILY BY 2 PEOPLE. A SOURCE OF GREAT AMUSEMENT FOR LITTLE KIDS. GET ONE YOU WONT REGRET IT. I am not allowed by Amazon Rules to mention if there is compensation for writing a review of this bidet. The width is listed as 15 inches but that does not include the control panel. I had a plumber install it. It needed plumbers tape as the fittings leaked in spite of the washers and since I have a Delta toilet with a small tank it needed another adapter from 1/2 to a 3/8ths. The plumber said it would not be a problem with most toilets. He is an excellent plumber and installation still was not easy. I have had it one day and like it a lot. If it holds up for more than 2 years (the term of the warrantee) I will be very pleased. I called the company to check how they were and the response is good and immediate.
Added 7/17/15 Still very pleased. The little glue on tabs that fix to the seat stoppers underneath the seat don't stay on but it doesn't seem to matter. One of the tabs pulled the seat stopper off and it got flushed but I called the company and they immediately sent a replacement kit so I assume it is a common occurrence. Washes well and dries semi adequately, one needs to follow with a towel as in most bidets."
"I have 3 complaints:

The first and most important-
I the main reason I purchased this model because it claimed to have an, ""Oscillating wide clean"". It does not mean what any rational person would think it mean. This thing has a pinpoint spray which when oscillation is selected moves the nozzle in and out along the length of your posterior. I thought wide meant it cleaned the width of your * not just the length of your crack. If I hadn't gotten it on sale I would be immediately returning it.

Second:
The seat doesn't stay up. The lid hits the front of the toilet storage rack so the seat doesn't raise far enough to stay up. This means that I either have to urinate with the seat down or hold the seat up while urinating.

Third:
This is far from easy to install. It took me about 1 hour just to get the seat installed and positioned squarely. The seat still sticks out about an inch past the front of the toilet. Attaching the water hoses was also difficult but mostly because of the location of my water valve. It is almost directly behind my toilet making it difficult to fit tools and hands in the space. I imagine a lot of toilets in older houses have this problem.

It is for these 3 reasons that I took off 2 stars.

The power cord was also too short to reach my outlet. I'm not complaining about this Just a heads up to buyers. I had anticipated this problem and I plan to run a new line to a closer location."
"After looking at other reviews, it seems like I'm having some of the same issues others have had. After about 6 months the right hinge broke. I was able to contact Bio Bidet and they sent out a new lid/hinge right away. The seat also discolored like someone else posted in the photos, and after about a year and a half I noticed a crack starting on the very back of the toilet seat.

One issue that really bothered me was the way the toilet seat is made. It's molded in such a way that there is a very thin line/crevice all around the base that makes it very difficult to clean thoroughly. If you want it cleaned well then you have to actually use a fine brush to clean in this crevice. I used an old toothbrush, which was a hassle, but necessary.

I am in the market for a new bidet seat, and am now wary. I've noticed that none of the bidets have pictures that show the underside of the toilet seats. I'll be requesting pics from other users because I'm not going to buy another one with this design flaw."
"Wife and I are in our early 70's , and we decided to get a Bidet. We found this one to be to our liking, and wanted to keep it simple, no remote. We are on a septic system and not putting TP in it , is a great advantage. The only thing we found on the negative side is the water pressure. Since the pump determines the pressure, it's most likely the manufacture regulates the pressure so as not to get a lawsuit, for any physical harm. But this (for us) cleans great about 90% of the time, which is dependent on our diet also. If this last 3 years and fails, we would probably get another one. Also we are retired and in no hurry, if we wanted to run through the cycle a 2nd time, no big deal."
"Bought a less expensive model for my home office bathroom and spent a few months trying to convince my wife that we needed one for our master bath. I figured if I bought one with these ""Luxury Features"" she'd finally quit laughing at me and give it a try. Once I installed it, which took around 20-30 minutes (most of that time was spent going back and forth to my shop in my back yard to get the right size wrench or screw driver to remove the old seat) she finally gave it a try. She loves it, now I'm the one laughing. I don't know what's wrong with us Americans, these things are great. They'll pay for themselves before you know it. I'm going to save a ton of money in toilet paper. Now I'm trying to convince her to let me buy one for our guest bathroom. That'll probably take a few more months. Now our daughters are laughing at both of us. They all think we're nuts, but I guarantee that after they get a chance to use them, we'll have the last laugh, especially when they start buying them for their families. Hmmm . . . I wonder if we can get a quantity discount? 4 daughters + husbands + 9 grandchildren and 3 great grandchildren = 9 houses x 2-3 bathrooms each. That's a lot of bidets. LOL"
"Love everything about this bidet! Easy to install. Simple to use! Comfortable. 10/10
The only thing I wish is that it would come with a remote ALONG with the side buttons. Or if you could order a remote separately for that bidet.
Excellent product! Will order more for other toilets!"
"Bought this item as a gift for my wife. She loves it! It does what it says, and it does it pretty well. Overall the plastic is a bit flimsy, but I assume this is to keep the entire unit from not being overly heavy. Did not get (or find in the box) the remote control they mention. All in all, can highly recommend."
"I was approaching surgery on both of my arms. My husband said I guess I'm gonna have to help you in the toilet, I thought ""no way""-I'm a nurse and I know what that entails!!
I started shopping for bidet, to meet my postsurgical needs.
In my search for bidet I kept coming back to the bio bidet 600. It is everything as described and more.
The touch buttons are easy for me to use even postoperative. The delivery of water for cleansing exerts a nice pressure that gets the job done. The drying option is exceptional.
The seat itself is low-profile meaning it doesn't look like a giant in my bathroom.
This product has maintained my independence in the bathroom, I can't tell you what that means to my quality of life and my dignity.
I will recover from my surgery and will continue to use my bio bidet. I am now a hard-core bio bidet addict!!
I foresee this in my life forever. In my profession, unfortunately I see many elderly women with urinary tract infections. I believe this product and its ability to genitourinary hygiene will definitely impact my future health in that respect.
You won't be disappointed."
"I was, for most of my life, of the opinion that bidets were silly and not useful. Having used one for a weekend at a hotel, I quickly changed my tune. After returning home I searched for a way to turn my normal toilet into a bidet. The one I used at the hotel had all the bells and whistles; warm seat, warm water, different pressures. Knowing how I LOVE hot water, I knew I needed one with the warm water feature. Now that it is summer, I enjoy the cool water, but come winter, I know I'll be pushing the heat to high.
Now I don't want to use any other toilet in the house. Even though it's upstairs and the farthest from where I spend most of my time in the house, I will go there over all other toilets.
It automatically goes to preset settings, which I probably could adjust, I just haven't figured that out. But it's not that hard to press the button to get the settings you want each time. I know there are some with remotes - we didn't need one more thing for the kids to play with or get in the way to clean. I like that it's only the control on the side.
Seat gets toasty quickly, and water warms nicely.
The kids love getting totally clean. We had to tell the kids to stop showing all their friends. It was quite the novelty."
"We had been looking for a bidet seat for a long time. (Wasn't a high priority purchase.) When this became available at a reduced price on the Treasure Truck, I went for the deal.

I did not think about the need for an outlet near the toilet, so had to call an electrician. He asked my about the power requirements and was surprised in a good way! He explained that he adds about 2-3 outlets a week for bidet seats and that many have a huge power draw that can require a new circuit. This one he could draw from existing power...this saved a potential large expense!!! The outlet didn't cost more than the minimum 1 hr. he charges.

Second, it was easy for me to install. The instructions could have been slightly clearer on one part; but, it wasn't hard to figure out. The included replacement hoses work great.

Last, it works like a charm. More importantly it made my wife happy ;)"
So easy to install and use. Very happy with this product. Highly recommend!
Mine did not come with a remote control. Temperature control is great. Installation was a bit tricky because we didn’t have an electrical outlet near our toilet. My husband is handy that way and installed an outlet for us behind the toilet. I love how clean I feel after using it.
Super easy installation you just need a wrench. Does a great job and all of the settings make it so it can be personalized.
"For about 18 months I was quite pleased with the purchase. Installation was easy enough, the bidet functioned well, and even though the stream wasn't as powerful as some other makes, it was good enough (so long as you perform routine maintenance on the nozzle tip to keep minerals from the water building up and clogging the nozzle). But then it started falling apart.

The bidet is made out of not particularly strong plastic, and after repeated use, the plastic begins cracking and breaking apart. The first part to go was one of the hinge covers that hold the lid in place. Now, if one isn't careful when lifting the lid, it can come off the unit entirely. Making this problem worse is that the hinge covers are located on the main body of the bidet so there is no way to fix this problem without installing a whole new unit. A couple of months later, the seat itself started to crack on the bottom, where the seat pads come into contact with the bowl. A large chunk of the seat has come out on one side of the seat and a four inch crack has formed on the other side -- it is not long for this world. Here, I could buy a replacement seat to fix the problem, for more than 20% of the cost of a whole new bidet. That's far to high of a price to pay for another piece of cheap plastic that I will no doubt need to replace in a few years (especially if it doesn't fix the broken lid as well. On top of all this the damper on the seat is starting to go so that it no longer closes slowly (the lid itself lost all damping when the hinge cover broke and must be eased down manually).

I am currently shopping for a new bidet, but will not consider BioBidet due to the quality issues I had with this model."
This is our 4th bioBidet toilet seat! We now have one in every bathroom. The features are amazing and assembly is a breeze. Highly recommend!
"After extensive research across different sites and reading tons of reviews, I settled on the BB 600. What a game changer! Solidly built, lots of great features That are comparable with more expensive models, and great reviews all across-the-board. It was easy to install. I was torn between this and the Toto but read enough reviews about installation problems with Toto that I’m super glad I went with the BB 600. It was a breeze to install, with super clear directions and all the parts that you would need. This is coming from someone who has zero experience with plumbing!. It’s been several weeks now and it has been truly transforming. Minus one star for the less than stellar water temperature; expect it to last no more than 40 seconds or so but it’s ok and the gradual cooling down means that I can get used to the water change. Honestly, it’s not that big of a deal. I love this product!"
"Because of some medical difficulties and the general issues related to aging, this product was recommended. After having it available for daily use, I can truthfully say its purpose and performance are excellent and worth every penny."
"I got this to replace my Brondell SW1000 that started leaking after five years. I really like this BH90. I’ve been really impressed with it so far. I think it does a better job then the SW1000 did. I found the water pressure/power to be fine. The drying mode could be better, I find that like my old bidet it’s just blowing hot air up your rear and not drying. The automatic seat is pretty cool. Your toilet literally greets you when you walk in the bathroom it’s like it saying let’s get down to business. Although it can be annoying when it opens when you’re trying to flush the toilet, sometimes you just want the lid closed and it tries to keep opening on you. It can be configured to open just the lid or the lid and the seat as well. It will close after a few minutes after you’ve left the bathroom. It does close a little bit faster and harder than I thought it would. You will hear a little thud when it closes and wonder what was that. Since I was replacing a previous bidet the install was really fast and easy. All I had to do was fasten it to the toilet and connect the water hose. The remote is kind of big but you get used to it. The nightlight feature is cool as well. It’s a blue light. Although to really see it you have to leave the toilet lid open."
"This is the best gift I bought myself. I’ve had lower lumbar fusion and it was difficult to twist and clean. This erases this difficulty. For someone with lower back issues or elderly, this is a nice gift. Wish I would have bought years ago. Very easy to install. Most difficult part is having a plug by the toilet. We had to have someone come in and install a line, but it works well because I also use the plug with my towel warmer. The toilet seat is a hard seat, but being heated makes it comfortable. Without getting to personal, this is great for women that just had a child or have not gone through menopause. Very cleansing!"
 Item works great. Easy to install. Slight delay between functions using the remote. Overall very satisfied
This is a great bidet. It works like a charm and has cut my toilet paper consumption by 75% the heated seats are wonderful as all the other features. My only complaint is the remote is very touchy. If you bump it or handle it wrong all your settings blow up and you have to reset. Who’s idea was it to put functions on the top and front! Not a fan. Other than that it’s a great unit.
"After 6mos of use, we've concluded this thing is beyond cool. Our requirements were fairly simple:
- Heated seat
- Heated water
- Stainless steel wand that self-cleans
- Auto lift of lid + seat
- Remote mounted on wall that's more like a remote panel, than a remote control. (I just wanted something where I can hit a button on the wall, not have to pull the remote out and hold it like a tv remote.) Also other benefit is, for the dudes, this type of remote means you can easily have the sit lift automagically at the touch of a button.

This is literally the ONLY seat that checks all these requirements + a slew of bonus features like the night light, odor eliminator, adjustable wand length, feminine mode, etc. in this price range. A similarly equipped Toto is well over $1k. And why? This so far is every bit as comfortable, reliable, and cool.

Bonus pros:
- nightlight means I can now pee at night without having to turn the noisy bathroom light/fan on, and waking up the wife
- it's 2 blue LEDs, the electricity consumption from using the nightlight is almost nil.
- with the auto closing lid, there's no more 'forgetting to put down the seat'

For the reviews who complained about water pressure - I truly am not sure what their situation is. We live in the hills where water pressure is weak in general, and we still use this at the lowest pressure setting. How much pressure washing do you need....!? But for us, that was the only concerning review and turned out to not be an issue.

Minor con - the drying feature is basically useless. Just use paper and be done with it. Otherwise how would you know it's clean ..."
"Not sure how this device received so many great reviews. Installation was not terrible, but instructions were a little vague. Unit looks great (like you would expect from Kohler) and the blue led night light is very convenient. Very cool feature.

Unfortunately, that's all the positives I have about this bidet seat. The most terrible part is the remote with the touch buttons. Some buttons are very sensitive, while others only respond about 1 out of 10 times. Very frustrating when you urgently need to go and have to spend a good 30 seconds trying to get the seat to go up. I wish they would have just used regular push buttons instead.

The heating for the seat and the water is a nice feature, but unfortunately the temperature settings don't seem to do much. Even though you have 5 different temperature settings, it feels like there is just ON and OFF. Either the seat and water get way too hot, or they don't heat up at all. There is no lukewarm, even when on the lowest setting.

Overall, I would strongly recommend to buy a cheaper unit, where these flaws are acceptable for the price, or buy a more expensive quality product. Either way, don't waste a lot of money on this sub-par quality device!"
"We got this after we experienced an automatic Toto toilet on a vacation. I am a fan of the plug free Kohler models, however, so rather than get a Toto, we wanted the best of both worlds so arrived at this seat.
*this will NOT fit all Kohler toilets despite what their customer service may say.*
Your toilet must have a right angle between the tank and bowl. If it is curved, like my Kohler toilet was, you will be at Home Depot on install day buying another Kohler toilet, like I was. You will obviously need an electrician to put a plug by the toilet. Other than that, your seat will be warm, the water will be warm and everlasting, and the dryer will work as so-so as the Toto toilet (hint:body position is key). The controls were annoying, along the difficulty level of tuning a new flat screen TV to a room. Once set, the only button we really use is the ""Auto"" button which runs a program of 2min warm water rinse, and 5 min of dryer time. You'll still, usually, feel the need for a couple of squares of toilet paper before you leave the seat, which is the same for the Toto that inspired the purchase."
"I've had this toilet seat for almost 2 months now and have used and tested all the functions extensively at this point. This is the second bidet seat I have owned, the other being the Toto K300. Since these are the two seats I am familiar with, I couldn't help but compare them to each other.

INSTALLATION
The Kohler BH-90 wins hands-down. I had a brief moment where I couldn't figure out which of the hoses connected to the seat (it's the white one), but other than that, it was smooth sailing. Installation took maybe 15 minutes total.
The Toto K300 involved a frustrating 3 hours of parts not screwing in correctly, a trip to the hardware store, and some toilet water sprayed in my face. It was enough of a hassle that for as much as I love the seat now, I did not look to Toto right away for my second seat.
Winner: Kohler BH-90

SEAT WARMER
I live in Michigan. It's cold here 7 months out of the year. As such, I did not turn any sort of power saving mode on. No, I wanted a warm toilet seat from the moment I sat down. The Kohler BH-90 is okay on that front. The seat isn't cold, but it isn't that warm either. It's just ""okay."" It warms up to the desired temperature within a minute.
The Toto K300, on the other hand, is perfectly warm from the moment I sit down.
Winner: Toto K300

BIDET
Before we get to the bidet function of the Kohler BH-90, I have to mention that this toilet seat is very large. It overhangs my standard American toilet by a little bit. Not enough to be a deal breaker, but it is noticeable. Not only is the seat itself large, the opening is large. This doesn't seem like a big deal until you try the bidet part out. Bizarrely enough, the spray wand of the Kohler BH-90 only comes out a little bit from the back, even when you change the setting to the forward-most spray option. You have to sit ALL the way back to get to the spray, and even then, it is usually not enough to prevent the water for splattering over the back of the seat. I'm not sure why the designers thought such a giant seat only merited a tiny spray wand, but this is a major design flaw. Everything else (pressure, temperature) is good.
The Toto K300 definitely wins hands-down in the bidet category. It does exactly what you want a bidet to do, nothing more, nothing less. And though this is a minor thing, the K300 allows you to save 2 user settings on the remote so you don't have to adjust the position, temperature, or water pressure each time you use it.
Winner: Toto K300

DRYER
The dryer for the Kohler BH-90 is not good. Seriously, pretend it is not there. It's very weak, and if you try to turn the temperature up so that it dries ""faster,"" the seat becomes unbearably hot in the back. Just use toilet paper.
The Toto K300 has a functional dryer. Takes a few minutes, does not get too hot, does the job. I never even thought twice about the dryer for that seat until I tried out the one for the Kohler BH-90. I have a new appreciation for the Toto K300's dryer.
Winner: Toto K300

DEODORIZER
This is one feature that you don't realize you need until you have one. The Kohler BH-90's deodorizer works well enough 8/10 times. But sometimes, you can still smell something.
The Toto K300's deodorizer, on the other hand, makes you think that your sh*t don't stink.
Winner: Toto K300

OTHER
The auto-open/auto-close feature for the Kohler BH-90 is pretty cool to have. Not necessary at all, but it is a nice luxury. The Toto K300, being a mid-range model for that brand, does not have this feature. Sometimes I walk up to the toilet expecting it to open on its own and it... doesn't.
The nightlight is a feature I do not use. I turned it on initially to test it (it works), but have since kept it off for the sake of saving electricity. FYI, if you do want this feature, it's not very clear in the instructions but the buttons you have to hold down to turn it on are on the side of the toilet itself, not the remote.

In conclusion, this is an okay toilet seat. It works well enough as long as you are not planning on using the bidet function. It does not feel like it is worth its $500 price tag. If I were to purchase a third bidet seat, I would go buy another Toto model, frustrating installation and all."
"I bought 2 of these at the start of the pandemic lockdown. That was about 3 years now. Both still work.
One for the full bathroom and one for the half bath.
The one in the half bath is not quite a disappointment. It arrived in what appeared to be re-sealed box, installed fine, cracked along the bottom within a week and the remote batteries keep dying. So, a battery charger has to be kept nearby with batteries ready to go. At this price, they should be able to troubleshoot this on the FAQ of the website. They don't. Also, the dryer and deodorizer doesn't work. Those never had worked since I got it. The install was fairly easy but, I'm not a plumber and it was not easy enough to keep installing it and uninstalling it to send back. So, I never sent it back.
Aside from that, the one in the full bathroom works great. Well, except for a crack that developed underneath the seat. But, that might just be a feature of this brand. Both my seats developed a crack and that seems to be common in a lot of reviews."
Had to reopen a defective hose
"We bought our Novita in December 2020, installed it in January 2021.
The Good: automatic seat makes me laugh almost every time I enter bathroom and startles most guest. Great conversation starter, less useful than I thought it would be, especially when you're not coming into bathroom to ""do your business"".
The nightlight is also nice, but we turned it off.
The seat functions fine, the rear cleanse is powerful on high setting and really does the job.
The remote is all touch sensitive with controls in front and along the top. They are a little finicky and often require multiple taps.
Looks beautiful in our remodeled guest bath.
The bad... Original seat failed after less than a year. Everything worked except the water pump. One day, working like a champ, next day, cleansing was dead as a doornail. Kohler shipped out an entirely new seat within days. They originally asked me to send the old seat back, but then said just trash it.
New seat worked great, until two days ago (March 28, 2023). So again, after about a year of working great (with a Novita water filter on the seat), the water pump is dead again. Everything else works, just no cleansing. Contacted Kohler again, without even batting an eye, they shipped out another new seat...
Hassle, yes.
Quality, short lived.
Kohler care... Awesome.

Recommend... Maybe. We have very hard water, but it seems the pump or solenoid that activates the valve is not the most robust. Buyer beware..."
"Edit: Contacted Kohler and they send out a replacement remote under the 1 year warranty.

Purchased 8/2020 and now its 4/2021 and the button on the remote for rear cleaning activates the female front cleaning. Quite a shock as I did my business as usual and hit the rear cleaning and was immediately shocked as the back of my balls was being hammered with water. I started adjusting the position of the nozzle then realized the feeling was different. Sure enough I looked down and and saw the feminine nozzle.

Tried it again and the same thing happened. Tried new batteries, tried leaving the batteries out of the remote for a while same thing. the buttons on the seat it self works but not as convenient. Looked on their official site and its $60 for a replacement remote! Not ideal so I guess I just use the turbo wash button from now on."
"This is the most high end bidet seat on the market with features not found on other high end seats. Initially had a problem with the seat but Kohler immediately sent a replacement. The remote control is easy to use and very versatile. Everything including water temperature, seat temperature, dryer temperature, nozzle position and water pressure are adjustable with the remote. Switching between front and rear wash is quick and easy. Unlike many other seats, there are built in controls on the side of the seat if you don’t want to use the remote. It took only 15 minutes to install with a simple adjustable wrench. I would recommend this seat over others costing much more."
"The absolute favorite part of my bathroom is this seat. Of course, everyone in the household find myriad excuses as to why they NEED to use MY bathroom. Installation was simple and didn't take much time at all. I am greeted with an automatically opened seat that is warm and comfortable. The night light really helps at night. Utilizing the bidet is excellent providing a soothing stream of water adjustable to your personal preference. The air dry gently minimizes wetness but doesn't over dry the delicate skin. Cons: If only I can get the toilet flush automatically! Unable to rest on or sit anything on lid due to slant. Overall: No regrets."
Easy to install —- I even ran the electrical box. Took me less than an hour and am loving this thing.
"I decided to give Kohler a shot after owning two BioBidet seats. The Kohler seat is by far much better than my Special Edition BID seat. The remote has a better layout, the water is hot from the start, and better overall features. Also, this seat is better than the USPA for the same water reason. In addition, both the BID and the USPA seat will crack if you are anywhere close to 200 lbs. At 230 lbs, I'm the largest of my household and I've replaced the seat twice on the BID in just over two years. My pre-teen kids use the USPA mostly but it is also showing signs of cracking."
I can't get the night light feature to work on my unit. That was a feature I really wanted and searched for. Sad I didn't get exactly what I wanted but love the rest of the unit. The water is always the perfectly warm temperature and no more fighting with my spouse on leaving the toilet seat up!
" Husband purchased this as a postpartum gift. Like that the nozzle is adjustable front to back, water pressure is adjustable as well.
Video to show the sounds and open closing speed. Remote has buttons to open/close along with battery saving modes. Have noticed batteries need changed often, like twice already in 9 weeks. Please ignore baby sounds and cat tails in video 👍🏼👍🏼"
"Most everything else about the functions of the bidet on here are all pretty much accurate as this is my first bidet, I think all of it’s functions for its price point is amazing. Though the air dryer takes time, but obviously if you’re in a rush use toilet paper.

My review is for their customer service, purchased this in March in 2019 and 8 months later started having some minor cosmetic issues through my own fault but despite that they sent me a new seat since the part is non serviceable. Because of their customer service they earned my trust and now a loyal customer."
"This is our second Koehler BH-93. We absolutely love both of them. We have owned them for over 3 years and have never had an issue. The stream is soft and gentle, but gets the job done!"
"Very easy to install. Night light a little too bright, can not adjust and too sensitive, does not turnoff in early morning light. Having a night light timer would be good. Still need to use tissue for assurance. Drying not that effective. Nice to have warm seat. Remote mounted on wall works good. Seat tilts down instead of level and can not sit on soft cover. Recommend over traditional seat."
"This Kohler Novita bidet is a seat fit for a king! Full of features you usually only find on high priced models. It was so nice we bought it twice! We have one in our master and our guest bathrooms. The heated seat, automatic lid lift, turbo wash, warm air dryer, nightlight and deodorizer are all awesome features that make this bidet stand out above the rest."
"We needed an electrical outlet next to the toilet, which got installed very easily, since it does not need high amp to operate. It was easy to install after. Fairly well made. Not sure how it would handle heavy weight for the long run."
"We own about 8 bidets between 2 houses. We have never had an issue with any of them. This one arrived and would not work. There was a sensor issue causing it to not register a person sitting down, thus did not work.

We actually paid a handyman to try and fix the issue vs immediately returning it. This same handyman installed 3 other bidets without issue. Big mistake. This was for a vacation house, so by the time that we were able to get a handyman up there to install the bidet, call kohler to try and fix it, the return window had expired.

We explained the situation and did not ask for a refund, simply for an exchange, and the seller's response was too bad...call Kohler, maybe they will help you. So, if you are looking for customer service...go elsewhere."
Didn't work.
Very easy to install and set up.
Most premium option is the auto seat. the least expensive bidet i could find with this option. all other functions work fine. i need to get another as we fight for use of the bathroom with the bidet.
"Everything is great and the bidet does aún outstanding job, provided you touch the right buttons at the remote control, which is unclear, with tiny letters/symbols. Not easy to manage especially if installed in your powder room where there will be guest unfamiliar with the system."
"Like I said, great till it quit working, in less than 20 uses. It is definitely Cadillac, but WHEN (not if) it breaks, Customer service is a joke, when you can get a hold of them. This is the third day I am working on this, and I have till the 31st to return it. Guess what?..."
 This washlet replaced a 9 year old Brondell Swash 1000. The automatic opening and closing of lid is an awesome feature that is usually available only on more expensive washlet models. Super easy install.
"Remote takes some getting used to. Warm water is continuous which is better than tank models.
Don't expect it to completely dry you. Fits my round toilet."
Amazing unit. I was between this and a Toto model but I am very happy with my choice. Has all the features you need and then some. Install is incredibly easy.
"This should be an awesome product, but it only works correctly 10% of the time and has a mind of its own. I would consider a different product. You cannot even touch the remote without triggering something. Frustrating for the cost of the unit."
Auto open and close lid is great and two tier nozzle is good as nozzle for women is covered when you use for no 2.
If you been to Korea you will know what I mean!
I needed a compact toilet and wound up with the Kohler San Souci. This bidet seat does not fit this toilet. Haven’t used product
Very easy product to use daily and benefit from .
"Very pleased, got this on a lightning deal and paid less about a third than my Toto and is damn near as good."
Amount of flow is good at first but got lower considerably - need to discuss issue with brondell
All the features seem to work as promised. Instructions could be a bit clearer. Very easy to install.
"The product is nice, but does not fit enlongated toilet set for one piece toilet. The seat size of the toilet and the bidet are the same measurements, however with the added distance needed for the bidet portion it does not work. The bidet toilet seat is at least an once past the actual toilet bowl. This means water will spray out under the bidet seat."
"It's a decent bidet. However, it started a rather major leak from the T adapter after being in use for less than a year.
There was sufficient water to create a puddle in the basement (the leaking toilet was on the second floor).
Overall, it functions well for a bidet when it's not leaking."
Recommended as every bit the Toto equivalent
"Nothing to dislike at all.
Easy to clean."
"BUYERS BEWARE!! Almost caught my house on fire! After installed by a professional plumber, the toiletseat had a leak that sprayed everywhere with tremendous force causing the electrical component inside to spark and smoked the entire restroom! WOULD NOT RECOMMEND BUYING!"
Amazing. I love it. Can’t imagine life without it.
It comfortable to the daily use
Exactly as described.
There were no attached clips as the manual directed to use for install. The Hose was wrong.
Love it
"No good
Don’t buy
If you buy
You can’t return"
"I first came across bidet/seats during my trips to Japan back in the 90's. I remember back then how much I wished that these were easy to buy in the US. That was then and today they are becoming quite common. We have had a few different makes and models at use in our home for the past 10 years or so, but we've never opted for an electric one with all the bells & whistles; until now. This unit from Kohler is our first high end bidet/seat.

Installation:
Easiest seat to install ever!. After removing the old seat, you simply install a VERY low profile bracket on the seat - no tools required. Get it aligned just right and tighten down with your fingers. The seat easily slides, then locks into place. It is just that simple! If you want to remove the seat simply toggle a small switch that is hidden on the side and it pops right off. Slide & lock back into place when you are ready to do this.

The plumbing aspect is a bit more involved, but still simple enough. There is a splitter valve (supplied) and two separate feed lines (supplied) that direct water to the tank and to the seat. You'll need a set of wrenches for this - don't use pliers or you will corrupt the finish of the connectors.

Plug it into a grounded outlet and you are ready to go. My installation (after removing the old seat) took about 15-20 tops. Mount the remote control within easy reach using the double sided tape.

Use:
Heated seat, heated water, heated air, auto open close lid or seat, auto clean, auto open... it almost does too many things! But it is very straightforward to figure out. It does everything as advertised and does it very well - every aspect is adjustable - all of the functions. The heated seat, water and air would be a Godsend in colder climates. We used to live in NH and there are many times when I wished for a heated seat alone! Texas... not so much. The air dryer is a nice touch - we never had that before. But be prepared for a long read if you are expecting it to completely dry your backside.

So why 4 and not 5 stars? Because it is too gentle. It is so easy on the backside that a toddler would be happy using it. The problem I have is that there is very little water pressure back there and sometimes you want a bit more. Yes - you can adjust the pressure, but it is from ""baby soft"" >> ""soft"" and that's it. We have another bidet that goes from ""Baby soft"" >> ""pressure washer"" - probably way too much; almost lifts you off the seat and could cause damage if you were not careful. But at least it gives you all ranges via a dial. Not this seat.

So yes - it is Nice, Elegant and Gentle. Great posterior cleaning with a royal touch - but nothing deeper if that is what you are looking for."
"Kohler’s BH90-N0 washlet/bidet seat is my second bidet seat and a nice improvement over my last bidet seat. Not perfect, but still a nice improvement. On the plus side the installation instructions are excellent. The heated seat works well (per the instructions it defaults to 82 degrees) and can be turned off. In our climate it’s not really needed but I tested the heated seat for a few days and it’s toasty warm. Also on the plus side is the water heating system. Generally, when selecting a bidet seat you have to choose between A) a cold water seat, B) a seat with a small internal heated water reservoir with instant hot water but that can run out of heated water in a busy bathroom, or C) a seat with unlimited warm water but that can take half a minute to warm up. The BH90 offers the best of both B&C, a very small luke-warm water reservoir and an endless warm water heating system so that you never run out of warm water. The endless warm water system has three temperature settings and on the highest setting gets as warm as I’d ever want while remaining quite comfortable. The cleaning wand has an oscillate mode that moves forward and back for thorough cleaning as well as front or rear cleaning. Finally, the seat's functions are almost all operated by a remote control.

On the down side water pressure is a tad lower than ideal, not bad, just a tad lower than I like. Second the remote isn’t intuitive and isn’t really meant to leave its wall mounted holder. Yes, it can be removed from the holder, but it’s awkward to do so and awkward in the hand and the settings are far from east to figure out. Finally, the user manual is pretty bad and for a seat is this price range there is no excuse for a poor manual. Improve the user manual a lot and perhaps I'll upgrade my review to 5-stars.

Two other features that are neither deal makers or deal breakers for me are the power-lift seat and the nightlight. The power-lift seat system lifts the cover or the cover and seat at the press of a button. The cover can also be set to automatically lift as you approach the toilet. I don’t use the automatic setting but it’ll probably impress the heck out of guests. The nightlight would be a lot more useful if it lighted the interior of the bowl to facilitate aiming in the dark. As it is, it lights the top of the bowl only and really just acts as a nightlight.

All in all, I like this bidet seat a lot. The water pressure isn’t really that much of a problem (it cleans very well) so I won’t deduct a star for that, however the user manual and the not all that well thought out remote control are enough to deduct one star. I still highly recommend this seat and will recommend it to friends."
"So far Not so good. This may not be the fault of the manufacturer, but just the way life works out these days. Prior to ordering the Kohler BH90-N0 Bidet Seat, I went to the Kohler website and checked to make sure the seat would fit. According to their website it should fit just right. The website also pointed out that you should make sure you have an electrical outlet near to the commode in your bathroom.
I had never used a bidet before so I don’t have a point of reference for some of my observations…(such as…the stream of water seems to be rather weak.)
And as for ease of installation, well, I had the bidet installed by a professional plumber so I can’t really comment except to tell you that Carl said the installation was pretty straightforward.
The bidet comes with an Installation Guide and a Homeowner’s Guide. It also comes with a remote control.

I read the instructions for the remote control twice before my first use of the bidet. I still had trouble using the remote. It turns out that the remote should have been secured to the wall. Carl didn’t secure the remote to the wall…he just handed it to me as he departed. It turns out that the remote is very sensitive and it really needs to be secured to the wall..hands free.

The biggest problem right off was that when I sat on the Cleansing seat it was a tight squeeze trying to fit all my important bodily parts over the bowl. The front of the Cleansing seat goes beyond the front rim of the bowl. My first thought was that my bowl (which was supposed to be large size) was actually medium size. Anyway, it was a tight squeeze but I managed to fit myself in, although uncomfortably.

First use: The spray from the nozzle was not hitting the right spot, and even though I had read the guide twice for operating the remote, I wasn’t able to adjust the spray correctly. I’ll do better next time. The same goes for water pressure…water pressure is adjustable. The spray seemed weak but all this was quite new to me, and I found it difficult to figure out how to adjust the spray using the remote. I am sure this is all connected to the fact that the remote was not fastened to the wall.
I have read the instructions again and I will do better next time. Getting the water temperature right also posed a problem. I need more practice. Also, I still needed to use toilet paper when I was done.

The whole procedure takes 7 minutes…two minutes of cleansing spray, and five minutes of drying. I am not used to sitting around on a toilet bowl so long. Next time I’ll bring a book to read.
The seat cover automatically rises when you approach the toilet bowl. At first, this was amusing but now it is getting to be a bit annoying. Every time I walk into the bathroom to get a towel or something from the closet the stupid seat cover rises up.
The bidet is supposed to have a blue night light which comes on automatically in the dark. My blue night light didn’t come on last night. I kept waking up to check on it.
But I am determined to make the bidet a regular part of my routine. I am getting up in years, and I want to maintain a certain degree of self-sufficiency for as long as I can.
Nature called me once again last night but instead of using the bidet I used the toilet in my second bathroom. I needed a return to normality

The cleansing seat is expensive, and it appears that I may have to buy a new toilet bowl so I can sit comfortably on the cleansing seat. Toilet bowls are quite expensive too.

So right now I am in a bit of a quandary as to what to do. My son is coming for a visit in October, and my son is a genius at this stuff. Me? not so much. So for the present time I am using the toilet bowl in my guest bathroom, and trying to clear my head from thinking about this bidet so much.

If you purchase this item I wish you better luck than I’ve had so far.

UPDATE: 10/21/18... The plumber had not installed the bidet exactly right. My son came for a visit and he installed it correctly. He had to buy an electrical extension cord because although the electrical outlet is right next to the bidet, it is not on the same side as where the electrical cord is, and it is about 1/4"" too short to plug into the outlet. By not adjusting the seat of the bidet correctly, however, the plumber had been able to plug the electrical cord into the outlet without going out and buying an extension cord. Unfortunately for me, however, the bidet was difficult to use with the seat too far forward.

So the bidet is now working pretty well. The stream of water is still quite weak, and the ""blue light"" still does not turn on in the dark. But otherwise, no complaints."
"I had thought about buying a bidet seat for quite a few years. Really? It's weird, right? Am I really going to like it? The good ones are so expensive! And again, it seems weird! Sometime last year, I had read an article that brought up the point that most people wouldn't consider their hands clean if they fell on a muddy patch of ground and just wiped their hands off without any water. That point made a lot of sense.

So, a few months ago, there was a sale on this particular seat so I took the plunge and bought it. ONE OF THE BEST PURCHASE DECISIONS I'VE EVER MADE. This thing is fantastic. Seriously, everyone should have a seat like this. It was easy to install. The features work great!

I really just wanted a bidet for the basic bidet purpose, and I really had no interest in many of this seats extra features, but now that I am used to them I am completely spoiled and addicted to them.

In the past I've always been in and out of the bathroom in 2 or 3 minutes. Now, it's not just ""business"", it's relaxation time.

Automatic seat opening! Really, it seems so silly, but it's soooo nice once you get used to it. Once in a while someone will be fiddling with the remote and disable it and and then I'm like WTF!

Even my wife, who sometimes grumbles at some of the gadgets I buy, loves the night lighting (which by the way, you need to enable via the control panel on the side of the seat as it was off by default on mine)

I've never given a second thought about the temperature of a toilet seat. Now that I have a heated one, if someone disables it and then I sit down, I'm not happy. I never realized how cold a normal toilet seat is.

The number one feature on this seat is tapping once on the oscillate button, and then once it starts, tapping a second time to go into the ""oscillating cleaning"" mode. That's the ticket right there. The jet moves back and forth. And the wonderful warm water does its job. You're clean. Really really clean,.

Is it perfect? Of course not. To be fair, I'll point out a few issues.

The bathroom I wanted to put it in is super small. And as a result I have an old, really really small round toilet fixture. Because of how small the fixture is, the seat couldn't be mounted far enough back so the front tip of the bowl is visible under the front of the seat by about a 1/2 inch. Initially, I was going to go out and find a fixture that had a little more room between the seat holes and the tank, but I got busy with other more pressing home improvement projects so this one is on the back burner for a while. To confirm, some people said ""you must have bought an elongated seat!"". No, it's round. It's just my toilet fixture is very compact.

The remote is great, but it takes a little while to figure everything out. The button labelled ""bidet"", is actually a. ""feminine wash"" mode. For me, the actual ""bidet"" button is the one labelled ""oscillate"", and you really need to tap that twice to get the best cleaning mode going. There are a LOT of buttons, and when putting the remote away it's easy to accidentally press one. That's why sometimes someone will unintentionally turn off the heated seat or other function.

Overall, this thing is AMAZING! Seriously the more I think about it, I remain amazed that the ""old"" way of cleaning up after using the bathroom is used so much. A bidet makes much more sense."
"I was sold one of these from a local contractor who did not offer other alternatives for installation. I am currently trying to return it, as it does not clean - which is the reason I wanted the bidet seat in the first place. All the bells & whistles are useless if I still have to pull out a bunch of toilet paper to get the c*** off of my posterior."
"This is the first bidet style toilet seat that I have ever used (or installed). I was hesitant to install it myself, but it ended up being a piece of cake. The instructions for installations were clear and straight forward and the diagrams were helpful. I completed the installation in under 20 minutes without any previous knowledge. The biggest factor to consider for installation was plug location. We did not have a plug in a convenient location so I actually had an electrician installation one closer to the toilet. That is not an issue specific to this seat, but it wasn’t something I had thought much about before receiving this unit. The seat and features have been great so far. We have used it for a few weeks now and it is a game changer. The features are all adjustable and the pressure and temperature have a perfect range to keep all parties in our household happy. The only reason I deducted a star is because the user manual and remote were not as intuitive. It wasn’t a deal breaker, but it did take me a few days to understand how to change all the settings, etc. overall I would definitely recommend this seat. Especially if you are like me and new to the world of bidets. The ease of installation was such a lovely surprise."
"This bidet seat does not compare well with my similarly-priced high-end Brondell seat. I've had that one for five years with zero problems.

First one I received did not work properly. Kohler's support consists of someone, presumably in another country, reading the owner's manual to you. They obviously do not know this product and are not equipped to diagnose and act on a defective unit.

The remote is unnecessarily complicated with a display that tries to do everything at once. It is very confusing. Buttons at the top make handling the remote without activating something that you don't want to activate nearly impossible.

Eco mode shuts off after 8 hours (what?). We do not want the seat warming and want to choose when the deodorizing fan comes on. It does not allow these features to turn off and stay off.

The automatic lid opener seems like a fun ""gee whiz"" feature. It is annoying having the lid open every time we walk into the bathroom so we deactivated it.

As for the active bidet features, it seems to work well. The remote continues to be annoying and you need to have the room well-lit so you can study the panel every time you use it.

For the money, I would buy something else."
"I bought two Novita BH-90s and one BioBidet BB-2000 around the same time. The Novita remotes are touch sensitive which is great but the buttons lose their markings easily upon constant use making it very hard to figure out what exactly you are pressing.

I live in a place with some decent amount of sedimentation, so I have to keep changing the filters a lot. Even with that the Notiva internals got clogged and the nozzle became a dribble (I checked and cleaned the nozzle, and the nozzle itself was fine) and I called Kohler and they basically refused to service it.

Around the same time, the BioBidet BB-2000 also had a clog and I called BioBidet. They not only were super helpful, they also shipped me the fixed unit back on their dime. (I paid to ship it out. They paid to to ship it back). They did charge me a repair fee to fix it, which I was willing to pay Kohler as well.

This was just bad customer service. What it resulted in was me buying another BB-2000 and junking the novita. That was just too bad. It was otherwise a perfectly functional unit. It just needed to be serviced, which Kohler refused."
"the Kohler BH90-Bidet is very easy to install, it has every imaginable function. The remote is not very ergonomic, but it is o.k. The water spray pressure is very soft. This is ideal and easy to for my elderly in-laws who sometimes have incontinence issues, but the whole family loves it.

"Love this unit as far as ease of installation, all features working great, access to remove and clean/disinfect spray nozzle and its easy reinstalling, etc.
However, one huge problem that knocked off 3 stars – the battery life of the three disposable double A lithium batteries stinks! 2 to 3 weeks, depending on use of the unit, is all it gets.

Buyer beware if you’re not into constantly changing the remote control’s batteries and the cost of doing so. As for using rechargeable batteries, the life of the charge is about half of the disposables, and so you’re constantly charging one set while the other lasts maybe a week or 10 days at most before needing to be removed and charged….."
"When Vine sent this for me to review, I was SO excited. I spent quite a bit of time in Europe a few years ago, where bidets are commonplace, and I got used to that bit of luxury.

I did have to hire an electrician to put the electrical into my loo-room (my potty is in a little separate room off of the main bathroom.)

Once installed, it surprised me with all of the controls. Water temperature, pressure, position...seat heater (that was a surprise and boy when you go from that to a regular seat, you realize how cold the regular seats are haha..) The dryer is somewhat effective, but doesn't always do the job on its own.

The seat is long, and may feel cumbersome at first. You can see that it is quite large on my normal sized toilet.

The automatic lid opener is...well...odd? It's convenient, to be sure, but you have to manually lower it (use the button on the remote) to flush the toilet.

I loved this thing so much, I am saving up to put one in my guest bathroom. Definitely luxurious and over the top."
"I've used Bidets around the world for many years. If you've never used one, I would suggest finding one you can test. You'll love the freshness, the cleanliness that you feel. I got this BH90-NO Kohler to replace a 14 year old Coco. It was at Costo for $299.99 on sale at $180.00 off. I have not found anything to dislike about the Kohler. Best of all it has a 3....yes 3 year warranty!!"
Purchased one year ago. Remote started to eat batteries quite frequently. Then stopped working. Controls on side of bidet stopped working also. Don't know what to do next.
"This feature-laden bidet is a wonderful bathroom upgrade. Installation is straightforward for both the seat and the plumbing. the elongated seat is comfortable and hit heats. The cleaning function works; I would prefer a tad more power. the pressure is adjustable but even at the higher setting, it seems very gentle. the dring function is ineffective. yes, there is hot air but unless you have a long time to wait, you will not get dry. The nightlight and auto open/close seat are cool and convenient. the remote is large and easy to use. Visually it has an appealing aesthetic. If you are considering a bidet, this one comes with a wide range of features and provides a mostly satisfactory experience."
Special Amazon price-- great Kohler customer service on a a defective part
"Great product. Easy to install, remote control is nice instead of side panel buttons. Also, remote nice to adjust spray wand in and out for optimal cleansing. Our tp usage has gone way down."
work very good
Love it. It was an easy install and took about 30 min. Easy to use and straight forward.
Works great. The auto seat motion feature is very sensitive but not really an issue
"The remote control acts up, it will keep making the notification sound on its own, as if your there pushing random buttons. Very annoying, only fix is to remove the batteries when it acts up and leave it that way."
"I got this to replace my Brondell SW1000 that started leaking after five years. I really like this BH90. I’ve been really impressed with it so far. I think it does a better job then the SW1000 did. I found the water pressure/power to be fine. The drying mode could be better, I find that like my old bidet it’s just blowing hot air up your rear and not drying. The automatic seat is pretty cool. Your toilet literally greets you when you walk in the bathroom it’s like it saying let’s get down to business. Although it can be annoying when it opens when you’re trying to flush the toilet, sometimes you just want the lid closed and it tries to keep opening on you. It can be configured to open just the lid or the lid and the seat as well. It will close after a few minutes after you’ve left the bathroom. It does close a little bit faster and harder than I thought it would. You will hear a little thud when it closes and wonder what was that. Since I was replacing a previous bidet the install was really fast and easy. All I had to do was fasten it to the toilet and connect the water hose. The remote is kind of big but you get used to it. The nightlight feature is cool as well. It’s a blue light. Although to really see it you have to leave the toilet lid open."
"This is the best gift I bought myself. I’ve had lower lumbar fusion and it was difficult to twist and clean. This erases this difficulty. For someone with lower back issues or elderly, this is a nice gift. Wish I would have bought years ago. Very easy to install. Most difficult part is having a plug by the toilet. We had to have someone come in and install a line, but it works well because I also use the plug with my towel warmer. The toilet seat is a hard seat, but being heated makes it comfortable. Without getting to personal, this is great for women that just had a child or have not gone through menopause. Very cleansing!"
 Item works great. Easy to install. Slight delay between functions using the remote. Overall very satisfied
This is a great bidet. It works like a charm and has cut my toilet paper consumption by 75% the heated seats are wonderful as all the other features. My only complaint is the remote is very touchy. If you bump it or handle it wrong all your settings blow up and you have to reset. Who’s idea was it to put functions on the top and front! Not a fan. Other than that it’s a great unit.
"After 6mos of use, we've concluded this thing is beyond cool. Our requirements were fairly simple:
- Heated seat
- Heated water
- Stainless steel wand that self-cleans
- Auto lift of lid + seat
- Remote mounted on wall that's more like a remote panel, than a remote control. (I just wanted something where I can hit a button on the wall, not have to pull the remote out and hold it like a tv remote.) Also other benefit is, for the dudes, this type of remote means you can easily have the sit lift automagically at the touch of a button.

This is literally the ONLY seat that checks all these requirements + a slew of bonus features like the night light, odor eliminator, adjustable wand length, feminine mode, etc. in this price range. A similarly equipped Toto is well over $1k. And why? This so far is every bit as comfortable, reliable, and cool.

Bonus pros:
- nightlight means I can now pee at night without having to turn the noisy bathroom light/fan on, and waking up the wife
- it's 2 blue LEDs, the electricity consumption from using the nightlight is almost nil.
- with the auto closing lid, there's no more 'forgetting to put down the seat'

For the reviews who complained about water pressure - I truly am not sure what their situation is. We live in the hills where water pressure is weak in general, and we still use this at the lowest pressure setting. How much pressure washing do you need....!? But for us, that was the only concerning review and turned out to not be an issue.

Minor con - the drying feature is basically useless. Just use paper and be done with it. Otherwise how would you know it's clean ..."
"Not sure how this device received so many great reviews. Installation was not terrible, but instructions were a little vague. Unit looks great (like you would expect from Kohler) and the blue led night light is very convenient. Very cool feature.

Unfortunately, that's all the positives I have about this bidet seat. The most terrible part is the remote with the touch buttons. Some buttons are very sensitive, while others only respond about 1 out of 10 times. Very frustrating when you urgently need to go and have to spend a good 30 seconds trying to get the seat to go up. I wish they would have just used regular push buttons instead.

The heating for the seat and the water is a nice feature, but unfortunately the temperature settings don't seem to do much. Even though you have 5 different temperature settings, it feels like there is just ON and OFF. Either the seat and water get way too hot, or they don't heat up at all. There is no lukewarm, even when on the lowest setting.

Overall, I would strongly recommend to buy a cheaper unit, where these flaws are acceptable for the price, or buy a more expensive quality product. Either way, don't waste a lot of money on this sub-par quality device!"
"We got this after we experienced an automatic Toto toilet on a vacation. I am a fan of the plug free Kohler models, however, so rather than get a Toto, we wanted the best of both worlds so arrived at this seat.
*this will NOT fit all Kohler toilets despite what their customer service may say.*
Your toilet must have a right angle between the tank and bowl. If it is curved, like my Kohler toilet was, you will be at Home Depot on install day buying another Kohler toilet, like I was. You will obviously need an electrician to put a plug by the toilet. Other than that, your seat will be warm, the water will be warm and everlasting, and the dryer will work as so-so as the Toto toilet (hint:body position is key). The controls were annoying, along the difficulty level of tuning a new flat screen TV to a room. Once set, the only button we really use is the ""Auto"" button which runs a program of 2min warm water rinse, and 5 min of dryer time. You'll still, usually, feel the need for a couple of squares of toilet paper before you leave the seat, which is the same for the Toto that inspired the purchase."
"I've had this toilet seat for almost 2 months now and have used and tested all the functions extensively at this point. This is the second bidet seat I have owned, the other being the Toto K300. Since these are the two seats I am familiar with, I couldn't help but compare them to each other.

INSTALLATION
The Kohler BH-90 wins hands-down. I had a brief moment where I couldn't figure out which of the hoses connected to the seat (it's the white one), but other than that, it was smooth sailing. Installation took maybe 15 minutes total.
The Toto K300 involved a frustrating 3 hours of parts not screwing in correctly, a trip to the hardware store, and some toilet water sprayed in my face. It was enough of a hassle that for as much as I love the seat now, I did not look to Toto right away for my second seat.
Winner: Kohler BH-90

SEAT WARMER
I live in Michigan. It's cold here 7 months out of the year. As such, I did not turn any sort of power saving mode on. No, I wanted a warm toilet seat from the moment I sat down. The Kohler BH-90 is okay on that front. The seat isn't cold, but it isn't that warm either. It's just ""okay."" It warms up to the desired temperature within a minute.
The Toto K300, on the other hand, is perfectly warm from the moment I sit down.
Winner: Toto K300

BIDET
Before we get to the bidet function of the Kohler BH-90, I have to mention that this toilet seat is very large. It overhangs my standard American toilet by a little bit. Not enough to be a deal breaker, but it is noticeable. Not only is the seat itself large, the opening is large. This doesn't seem like a big deal until you try the bidet part out. Bizarrely enough, the spray wand of the Kohler BH-90 only comes out a little bit from the back, even when you change the setting to the forward-most spray option. You have to sit ALL the way back to get to the spray, and even then, it is usually not enough to prevent the water for splattering over the back of the seat. I'm not sure why the designers thought such a giant seat only merited a tiny spray wand, but this is a major design flaw. Everything else (pressure, temperature) is good.
The Toto K300 definitely wins hands-down in the bidet category. It does exactly what you want a bidet to do, nothing more, nothing less. And though this is a minor thing, the K300 allows you to save 2 user settings on the remote so you don't have to adjust the position, temperature, or water pressure each time you use it.
Winner: Toto K300

DRYER
The dryer for the Kohler BH-90 is not good. Seriously, pretend it is not there. It's very weak, and if you try to turn the temperature up so that it dries ""faster,"" the seat becomes unbearably hot in the back. Just use toilet paper.
The Toto K300 has a functional dryer. Takes a few minutes, does not get too hot, does the job. I never even thought twice about the dryer for that seat until I tried out the one for the Kohler BH-90. I have a new appreciation for the Toto K300's dryer.
Winner: Toto K300

DEODORIZER
This is one feature that you don't realize you need until you have one. The Kohler BH-90's deodorizer works well enough 8/10 times. But sometimes, you can still smell something.
The Toto K300's deodorizer, on the other hand, makes you think that your sh*t don't stink.
Winner: Toto K300

OTHER
The auto-open/auto-close feature for the Kohler BH-90 is pretty cool to have. Not necessary at all, but it is a nice luxury. The Toto K300, being a mid-range model for that brand, does not have this feature. Sometimes I walk up to the toilet expecting it to open on its own and it... doesn't.
The nightlight is a feature I do not use. I turned it on initially to test it (it works), but have since kept it off for the sake of saving electricity. FYI, if you do want this feature, it's not very clear in the instructions but the buttons you have to hold down to turn it on are on the side of the toilet itself, not the remote.

In conclusion, this is an okay toilet seat. It works well enough as long as you are not planning on using the bidet function. It does not feel like it is worth its $500 price tag. If I were to purchase a third bidet seat, I would go buy another Toto model, frustrating installation and all."
"I bought 2 of these at the start of the pandemic lockdown. That was about 3 years now. Both still work.
One for the full bathroom and one for the half bath.
The one in the half bath is not quite a disappointment. It arrived in what appeared to be re-sealed box, installed fine, cracked along the bottom within a week and the remote batteries keep dying. So, a battery charger has to be kept nearby with batteries ready to go. At this price, they should be able to troubleshoot this on the FAQ of the website. They don't. Also, the dryer and deodorizer doesn't work. Those never had worked since I got it. The install was fairly easy but, I'm not a plumber and it was not easy enough to keep installing it and uninstalling it to send back. So, I never sent it back.
Aside from that, the one in the full bathroom works great. Well, except for a crack that developed underneath the seat. But, that might just be a feature of this brand. Both my seats developed a crack and that seems to be common in a lot of reviews."
Had to reopen a defective hose
"We bought our Novita in December 2020, installed it in January 2021.
The Good: automatic seat makes me laugh almost every time I enter bathroom and startles most guest. Great conversation starter, less useful than I thought it would be, especially when you're not coming into bathroom to ""do your business"".
The nightlight is also nice, but we turned it off.
The seat functions fine, the rear cleanse is powerful on high setting and really does the job.
The remote is all touch sensitive with controls in front and along the top. They are a little finicky and often require multiple taps.
Looks beautiful in our remodeled guest bath.
The bad... Original seat failed after less than a year. Everything worked except the water pump. One day, working like a champ, next day, cleansing was dead as a doornail. Kohler shipped out an entirely new seat within days. They originally asked me to send the old seat back, but then said just trash it.
New seat worked great, until two days ago (March 28, 2023). So again, after about a year of working great (with a Novita water filter on the seat), the water pump is dead again. Everything else works, just no cleansing. Contacted Kohler again, without even batting an eye, they shipped out another new seat...
Hassle, yes.
Quality, short lived.
Kohler care... Awesome.

Recommend... Maybe. We have very hard water, but it seems the pump or solenoid that activates the valve is not the most robust. Buyer beware..."
"Edit: Contacted Kohler and they send out a replacement remote under the 1 year warranty.

Purchased 8/2020 and now its 4/2021 and the button on the remote for rear cleaning activates the female front cleaning. Quite a shock as I did my business as usual and hit the rear cleaning and was immediately shocked as the back of my balls was being hammered with water. I started adjusting the position of the nozzle then realized the feeling was different. Sure enough I looked down and and saw the feminine nozzle.

Tried it again and the same thing happened. Tried new batteries, tried leaving the batteries out of the remote for a while same thing. the buttons on the seat it self works but not as convenient. Looked on their official site and its $60 for a replacement remote! Not ideal so I guess I just use the turbo wash button from now on."
"This is the most high end bidet seat on the market with features not found on other high end seats. Initially had a problem with the seat but Kohler immediately sent a replacement. The remote control is easy to use and very versatile. Everything including water temperature, seat temperature, dryer temperature, nozzle position and water pressure are adjustable with the remote. Switching between front and rear wash is quick and easy. Unlike many other seats, there are built in controls on the side of the seat if you don’t want to use the remote. It took only 15 minutes to install with a simple adjustable wrench. I would recommend this seat over others costing much more."
"The absolute favorite part of my bathroom is this seat. Of course, everyone in the household find myriad excuses as to why they NEED to use MY bathroom. Installation was simple and didn't take much time at all. I am greeted with an automatically opened seat that is warm and comfortable. The night light really helps at night. Utilizing the bidet is excellent providing a soothing stream of water adjustable to your personal preference. The air dry gently minimizes wetness but doesn't over dry the delicate skin. Cons: If only I can get the toilet flush automatically! Unable to rest on or sit anything on lid due to slant. Overall: No regrets."
Easy to install —- I even ran the electrical box. Took me less than an hour and am loving this thing.
"I decided to give Kohler a shot after owning two BioBidet seats. The Kohler seat is by far much better than my Special Edition BID seat. The remote has a better layout, the water is hot from the start, and better overall features. Also, this seat is better than the USPA for the same water reason. In addition, both the BID and the USPA seat will crack if you are anywhere close to 200 lbs. At 230 lbs, I'm the largest of my household and I've replaced the seat twice on the BID in just over two years. My pre-teen kids use the USPA mostly but it is also showing signs of cracking."
I can't get the night light feature to work on my unit. That was a feature I really wanted and searched for. Sad I didn't get exactly what I wanted but love the rest of the unit. The water is always the perfectly warm temperature and no more fighting with my spouse on leaving the toilet seat up!
" Husband purchased this as a postpartum gift. Like that the nozzle is adjustable front to back, water pressure is adjustable as well.
Video to show the sounds and open closing speed. Remote has buttons to open/close along with battery saving modes. Have noticed batteries need changed often, like twice already in 9 weeks. Please ignore baby sounds and cat tails in video 👍🏼👍🏼"
"Most everything else about the functions of the bidet on here are all pretty much accurate as this is my first bidet, I think all of it’s functions for its price point is amazing. Though the air dryer takes time, but obviously if you’re in a rush use toilet paper.

My review is for their customer service, purchased this in March in 2019 and 8 months later started having some minor cosmetic issues through my own fault but despite that they sent me a new seat since the part is non serviceable. Because of their customer service they earned my trust and now a loyal customer."
"This is our second Koehler BH-93. We absolutely love both of them. We have owned them for over 3 years and have never had an issue. The stream is soft and gentle, but gets the job done!"
"Very easy to install. Night light a little too bright, can not adjust and too sensitive, does not turnoff in early morning light. Having a night light timer would be good. Still need to use tissue for assurance. Drying not that effective. Nice to have warm seat. Remote mounted on wall works good. Seat tilts down instead of level and can not sit on soft cover. Recommend over traditional seat."
"This Kohler Novita bidet is a seat fit for a king! Full of features you usually only find on high priced models. It was so nice we bought it twice! We have one in our master and our guest bathrooms. The heated seat, automatic lid lift, turbo wash, warm air dryer, nightlight and deodorizer are all awesome features that make this bidet stand out above the rest."
"We needed an electrical outlet next to the toilet, which got installed very easily, since it does not need high amp to operate. It was easy to install after. Fairly well made. Not sure how it would handle heavy weight for the long run."
"We own about 8 bidets between 2 houses. We have never had an issue with any of them. This one arrived and would not work. There was a sensor issue causing it to not register a person sitting down, thus did not work.

We actually paid a handyman to try and fix the issue vs immediately returning it. This same handyman installed 3 other bidets without issue. Big mistake. This was for a vacation house, so by the time that we were able to get a handyman up there to install the bidet, call kohler to try and fix it, the return window had expired.

We explained the situation and did not ask for a refund, simply for an exchange, and the seller's response was too bad...call Kohler, maybe they will help you. So, if you are looking for customer service...go elsewhere."
Didn't work.
Very easy to install and set up.
Most premium option is the auto seat. the least expensive bidet i could find with this option. all other functions work fine. i need to get another as we fight for use of the bathroom with the bidet.
"Everything is great and the bidet does aún outstanding job, provided you touch the right buttons at the remote control, which is unclear, with tiny letters/symbols. Not easy to manage especially if installed in your powder room where there will be guest unfamiliar with the system."
"Like I said, great till it quit working, in less than 20 uses. It is definitely Cadillac, but WHEN (not if) it breaks, Customer service is a joke, when you can get a hold of them. This is the third day I am working on this, and I have till the 31st to return it. Guess what?..."
 This washlet replaced a 9 year old Brondell Swash 1000. The automatic opening and closing of lid is an awesome feature that is usually available only on more expensive washlet models. Super easy install.
"Remote takes some getting used to. Warm water is continuous which is better than tank models.
Don't expect it to completely dry you. Fits my round toilet."
Amazing unit. I was between this and a Toto model but I am very happy with my choice. Has all the features you need and then some. Install is incredibly easy.
"This should be an awesome product, but it only works correctly 10% of the time and has a mind of its own. I would consider a different product. You cannot even touch the remote without triggering something. Frustrating for the cost of the unit."
Auto open and close lid is great and two tier nozzle is good as nozzle for women is covered when you use for no 2.
If you been to Korea you will know what I mean!
I needed a compact toilet and wound up with the Kohler San Souci. This bidet seat does not fit this toilet. Haven’t used product
Very easy product to use daily and benefit from .
"Very pleased, got this on a lightning deal and paid less about a third than my Toto and is damn near as good."
Amount of flow is good at first but got lower considerably - need to discuss issue with brondell
All the features seem to work as promised. Instructions could be a bit clearer. Very easy to install.
"The product is nice, but does not fit enlongated toilet set for one piece toilet. The seat size of the toilet and the bidet are the same measurements, however with the added distance needed for the bidet portion it does not work. The bidet toilet seat is at least an once past the actual toilet bowl. This means water will spray out under the bidet seat."
"It's a decent bidet. However, it started a rather major leak from the T adapter after being in use for less than a year.
There was sufficient water to create a puddle in the basement (the leaking toilet was on the second floor).
Overall, it functions well for a bidet when it's not leaking."
Recommended as every bit the Toto equivalent
"Nothing to dislike at all.
Easy to clean."
"BUYERS BEWARE!! Almost caught my house on fire! After installed by a professional plumber, the toiletseat had a leak that sprayed everywhere with tremendous force causing the electrical component inside to spark and smoked the entire restroom! WOULD NOT RECOMMEND BUYING!"
Amazing. I love it. Can’t imagine life without it.
It comfortable to the daily use
Exactly as described.
There were no attached clips as the manual directed to use for install. The Hose was wrong.
Love it
"No good
Don’t buy
If you buy
You can’t return"
"I first came across bidet/seats during my trips to Japan back in the 90's. I remember back then how much I wished that these were easy to buy in the US. That was then and today they are becoming quite common. We have had a few different makes and models at use in our home for the past 10 years or so, but we've never opted for an electric one with all the bells & whistles; until now. This unit from Kohler is our first high end bidet/seat.

Installation:
Easiest seat to install ever!. After removing the old seat, you simply install a VERY low profile bracket on the seat - no tools required. Get it aligned just right and tighten down with your fingers. The seat easily slides, then locks into place. It is just that simple! If you want to remove the seat simply toggle a small switch that is hidden on the side and it pops right off. Slide & lock back into place when you are ready to do this.

The plumbing aspect is a bit more involved, but still simple enough. There is a splitter valve (supplied) and two separate feed lines (supplied) that direct water to the tank and to the seat. You'll need a set of wrenches for this - don't use pliers or you will corrupt the finish of the connectors.

Plug it into a grounded outlet and you are ready to go. My installation (after removing the old seat) took about 15-20 tops. Mount the remote control within easy reach using the double sided tape.

Use:
Heated seat, heated water, heated air, auto open close lid or seat, auto clean, auto open... it almost does too many things! But it is very straightforward to figure out. It does everything as advertised and does it very well - every aspect is adjustable - all of the functions. The heated seat, water and air would be a Godsend in colder climates. We used to live in NH and there are many times when I wished for a heated seat alone! Texas... not so much. The air dryer is a nice touch - we never had that before. But be prepared for a long read if you are expecting it to completely dry your backside.

So why 4 and not 5 stars? Because it is too gentle. It is so easy on the backside that a toddler would be happy using it. The problem I have is that there is very little water pressure back there and sometimes you want a bit more. Yes - you can adjust the pressure, but it is from ""baby soft"" >> ""soft"" and that's it. We have another bidet that goes from ""Baby soft"" >> ""pressure washer"" - probably way too much; almost lifts you off the seat and could cause damage if you were not careful. But at least it gives you all ranges via a dial. Not this seat.

So yes - it is Nice, Elegant and Gentle. Great posterior cleaning with a royal touch - but nothing deeper if that is what you are looking for."
"Kohler’s BH90-N0 washlet/bidet seat is my second bidet seat and a nice improvement over my last bidet seat. Not perfect, but still a nice improvement. On the plus side the installation instructions are excellent. The heated seat works well (per the instructions it defaults to 82 degrees) and can be turned off. In our climate it’s not really needed but I tested the heated seat for a few days and it’s toasty warm. Also on the plus side is the water heating system. Generally, when selecting a bidet seat you have to choose between A) a cold water seat, B) a seat with a small internal heated water reservoir with instant hot water but that can run out of heated water in a busy bathroom, or C) a seat with unlimited warm water but that can take half a minute to warm up. The BH90 offers the best of both B&C, a very small luke-warm water reservoir and an endless warm water heating system so that you never run out of warm water. The endless warm water system has three temperature settings and on the highest setting gets as warm as I’d ever want while remaining quite comfortable. The cleaning wand has an oscillate mode that moves forward and back for thorough cleaning as well as front or rear cleaning. Finally, the seat's functions are almost all operated by a remote control.

On the down side water pressure is a tad lower than ideal, not bad, just a tad lower than I like. Second the remote isn’t intuitive and isn’t really meant to leave its wall mounted holder. Yes, it can be removed from the holder, but it’s awkward to do so and awkward in the hand and the settings are far from east to figure out. Finally, the user manual is pretty bad and for a seat is this price range there is no excuse for a poor manual. Improve the user manual a lot and perhaps I'll upgrade my review to 5-stars.

Two other features that are neither deal makers or deal breakers for me are the power-lift seat and the nightlight. The power-lift seat system lifts the cover or the cover and seat at the press of a button. The cover can also be set to automatically lift as you approach the toilet. I don’t use the automatic setting but it’ll probably impress the heck out of guests. The nightlight would be a lot more useful if it lighted the interior of the bowl to facilitate aiming in the dark. As it is, it lights the top of the bowl only and really just acts as a nightlight.

All in all, I like this bidet seat a lot. The water pressure isn’t really that much of a problem (it cleans very well) so I won’t deduct a star for that, however the user manual and the not all that well thought out remote control are enough to deduct one star. I still highly recommend this seat and will recommend it to friends."
"So far Not so good. This may not be the fault of the manufacturer, but just the way life works out these days. Prior to ordering the Kohler BH90-N0 Bidet Seat, I went to the Kohler website and checked to make sure the seat would fit. According to their website it should fit just right. The website also pointed out that you should make sure you have an electrical outlet near to the commode in your bathroom.
I had never used a bidet before so I don’t have a point of reference for some of my observations…(such as…the stream of water seems to be rather weak.)
And as for ease of installation, well, I had the bidet installed by a professional plumber so I can’t really comment except to tell you that Carl said the installation was pretty straightforward.
The bidet comes with an Installation Guide and a Homeowner’s Guide. It also comes with a remote control.

I read the instructions for the remote control twice before my first use of the bidet. I still had trouble using the remote. It turns out that the remote should have been secured to the wall. Carl didn’t secure the remote to the wall…he just handed it to me as he departed. It turns out that the remote is very sensitive and it really needs to be secured to the wall..hands free.

The biggest problem right off was that when I sat on the Cleansing seat it was a tight squeeze trying to fit all my important bodily parts over the bowl. The front of the Cleansing seat goes beyond the front rim of the bowl. My first thought was that my bowl (which was supposed to be large size) was actually medium size. Anyway, it was a tight squeeze but I managed to fit myself in, although uncomfortably.

First use: The spray from the nozzle was not hitting the right spot, and even though I had read the guide twice for operating the remote, I wasn’t able to adjust the spray correctly. I’ll do better next time. The same goes for water pressure…water pressure is adjustable. The spray seemed weak but all this was quite new to me, and I found it difficult to figure out how to adjust the spray using the remote. I am sure this is all connected to the fact that the remote was not fastened to the wall.
I have read the instructions again and I will do better next time. Getting the water temperature right also posed a problem. I need more practice. Also, I still needed to use toilet paper when I was done.

The whole procedure takes 7 minutes…two minutes of cleansing spray, and five minutes of drying. I am not used to sitting around on a toilet bowl so long. Next time I’ll bring a book to read.
The seat cover automatically rises when you approach the toilet bowl. At first, this was amusing but now it is getting to be a bit annoying. Every time I walk into the bathroom to get a towel or something from the closet the stupid seat cover rises up.
The bidet is supposed to have a blue night light which comes on automatically in the dark. My blue night light didn’t come on last night. I kept waking up to check on it.
But I am determined to make the bidet a regular part of my routine. I am getting up in years, and I want to maintain a certain degree of self-sufficiency for as long as I can.
Nature called me once again last night but instead of using the bidet I used the toilet in my second bathroom. I needed a return to normality

The cleansing seat is expensive, and it appears that I may have to buy a new toilet bowl so I can sit comfortably on the cleansing seat. Toilet bowls are quite expensive too.

So right now I am in a bit of a quandary as to what to do. My son is coming for a visit in October, and my son is a genius at this stuff. Me? not so much. So for the present time I am using the toilet bowl in my guest bathroom, and trying to clear my head from thinking about this bidet so much.

If you purchase this item I wish you better luck than I’ve had so far.

UPDATE: 10/21/18... The plumber had not installed the bidet exactly right. My son came for a visit and he installed it correctly. He had to buy an electrical extension cord because although the electrical outlet is right next to the bidet, it is not on the same side as where the electrical cord is, and it is about 1/4"" too short to plug into the outlet. By not adjusting the seat of the bidet correctly, however, the plumber had been able to plug the electrical cord into the outlet without going out and buying an extension cord. Unfortunately for me, however, the bidet was difficult to use with the seat too far forward.

So the bidet is now working pretty well. The stream of water is still quite weak, and the ""blue light"" still does not turn on in the dark. But otherwise, no complaints."
"I had thought about buying a bidet seat for quite a few years. Really? It's weird, right? Am I really going to like it? The good ones are so expensive! And again, it seems weird! Sometime last year, I had read an article that brought up the point that most people wouldn't consider their hands clean if they fell on a muddy patch of ground and just wiped their hands off without any water. That point made a lot of sense.

So, a few months ago, there was a sale on this particular seat so I took the plunge and bought it. ONE OF THE BEST PURCHASE DECISIONS I'VE EVER MADE. This thing is fantastic. Seriously, everyone should have a seat like this. It was easy to install. The features work great!

I really just wanted a bidet for the basic bidet purpose, and I really had no interest in many of this seats extra features, but now that I am used to them I am completely spoiled and addicted to them.

In the past I've always been in and out of the bathroom in 2 or 3 minutes. Now, it's not just ""business"", it's relaxation time.

Automatic seat opening! Really, it seems so silly, but it's soooo nice once you get used to it. Once in a while someone will be fiddling with the remote and disable it and and then I'm like WTF!

Even my wife, who sometimes grumbles at some of the gadgets I buy, loves the night lighting (which by the way, you need to enable via the control panel on the side of the seat as it was off by default on mine)

I've never given a second thought about the temperature of a toilet seat. Now that I have a heated one, if someone disables it and then I sit down, I'm not happy. I never realized how cold a normal toilet seat is.

The number one feature on this seat is tapping once on the oscillate button, and then once it starts, tapping a second time to go into the ""oscillating cleaning"" mode. That's the ticket right there. The jet moves back and forth. And the wonderful warm water does its job. You're clean. Really really clean,.

Is it perfect? Of course not. To be fair, I'll point out a few issues.

The bathroom I wanted to put it in is super small. And as a result I have an old, really really small round toilet fixture. Because of how small the fixture is, the seat couldn't be mounted far enough back so the front tip of the bowl is visible under the front of the seat by about a 1/2 inch. Initially, I was going to go out and find a fixture that had a little more room between the seat holes and the tank, but I got busy with other more pressing home improvement projects so this one is on the back burner for a while. To confirm, some people said ""you must have bought an elongated seat!"". No, it's round. It's just my toilet fixture is very compact.

The remote is great, but it takes a little while to figure everything out. The button labelled ""bidet"", is actually a. ""feminine wash"" mode. For me, the actual ""bidet"" button is the one labelled ""oscillate"", and you really need to tap that twice to get the best cleaning mode going. There are a LOT of buttons, and when putting the remote away it's easy to accidentally press one. That's why sometimes someone will unintentionally turn off the heated seat or other function.

Overall, this thing is AMAZING! Seriously the more I think about it, I remain amazed that the ""old"" way of cleaning up after using the bathroom is used so much. A bidet makes much more sense."
"I was sold one of these from a local contractor who did not offer other alternatives for installation. I am currently trying to return it, as it does not clean - which is the reason I wanted the bidet seat in the first place. All the bells & whistles are useless if I still have to pull out a bunch of toilet paper to get the c*** off of my posterior."
"This is the first bidet style toilet seat that I have ever used (or installed). I was hesitant to install it myself, but it ended up being a piece of cake. The instructions for installations were clear and straight forward and the diagrams were helpful. I completed the installation in under 20 minutes without any previous knowledge. The biggest factor to consider for installation was plug location. We did not have a plug in a convenient location so I actually had an electrician installation one closer to the toilet. That is not an issue specific to this seat, but it wasn’t something I had thought much about before receiving this unit. The seat and features have been great so far. We have used it for a few weeks now and it is a game changer. The features are all adjustable and the pressure and temperature have a perfect range to keep all parties in our household happy. The only reason I deducted a star is because the user manual and remote were not as intuitive. It wasn’t a deal breaker, but it did take me a few days to understand how to change all the settings, etc. overall I would definitely recommend this seat. Especially if you are like me and new to the world of bidets. The ease of installation was such a lovely surprise."
"This bidet seat does not compare well with my similarly-priced high-end Brondell seat. I've had that one for five years with zero problems.

First one I received did not work properly. Kohler's support consists of someone, presumably in another country, reading the owner's manual to you. They obviously do not know this product and are not equipped to diagnose and act on a defective unit.

The remote is unnecessarily complicated with a display that tries to do everything at once. It is very confusing. Buttons at the top make handling the remote without activating something that you don't want to activate nearly impossible.

Eco mode shuts off after 8 hours (what?). We do not want the seat warming and want to choose when the deodorizing fan comes on. It does not allow these features to turn off and stay off.

The automatic lid opener seems like a fun ""gee whiz"" feature. It is annoying having the lid open every time we walk into the bathroom so we deactivated it.

As for the active bidet features, it seems to work well. The remote continues to be annoying and you need to have the room well-lit so you can study the panel every time you use it.

For the money, I would buy something else."
"I bought two Novita BH-90s and one BioBidet BB-2000 around the same time. The Novita remotes are touch sensitive which is great but the buttons lose their markings easily upon constant use making it very hard to figure out what exactly you are pressing.

I live in a place with some decent amount of sedimentation, so I have to keep changing the filters a lot. Even with that the Notiva internals got clogged and the nozzle became a dribble (I checked and cleaned the nozzle, and the nozzle itself was fine) and I called Kohler and they basically refused to service it.

Around the same time, the BioBidet BB-2000 also had a clog and I called BioBidet. They not only were super helpful, they also shipped me the fixed unit back on their dime. (I paid to ship it out. They paid to to ship it back). They did charge me a repair fee to fix it, which I was willing to pay Kohler as well.

This was just bad customer service. What it resulted in was me buying another BB-2000 and junking the novita. That was just too bad. It was otherwise a perfectly functional unit. It just needed to be serviced, which Kohler refused."
"the Kohler BH90-Bidet is very easy to install, it has every imaginable function. The remote is not very ergonomic, but it is o.k. The water spray pressure is very soft. This is ideal and easy to for my elderly in-laws who sometimes have incontinence issues, but the whole family loves it.

"Love this unit as far as ease of installation, all features working great, access to remove and clean/disinfect spray nozzle and its easy reinstalling, etc.
However, one huge problem that knocked off 3 stars – the battery life of the three disposable double A lithium batteries stinks! 2 to 3 weeks, depending on use of the unit, is all it gets.

Buyer beware if you’re not into constantly changing the remote control’s batteries and the cost of doing so. As for using rechargeable batteries, the life of the charge is about half of the disposables, and so you’re constantly charging one set while the other lasts maybe a week or 10 days at most before needing to be removed and charged….."
"When Vine sent this for me to review, I was SO excited. I spent quite a bit of time in Europe a few years ago, where bidets are commonplace, and I got used to that bit of luxury.

I did have to hire an electrician to put the electrical into my loo-room (my potty is in a little separate room off of the main bathroom.)

Once installed, it surprised me with all of the controls. Water temperature, pressure, position...seat heater (that was a surprise and boy when you go from that to a regular seat, you realize how cold the regular seats are haha..) The dryer is somewhat effective, but doesn't always do the job on its own.

The seat is long, and may feel cumbersome at first. You can see that it is quite large on my normal sized toilet.

The automatic lid opener is...well...odd? It's convenient, to be sure, but you have to manually lower it (use the button on the remote) to flush the toilet.

I loved this thing so much, I am saving up to put one in my guest bathroom. Definitely luxurious and over the top."
"I've used Bidets around the world for many years. If you've never used one, I would suggest finding one you can test. You'll love the freshness, the cleanliness that you feel. I got this BH90-NO Kohler to replace a 14 year old Coco. It was at Costo for $299.99 on sale at $180.00 off. I have not found anything to dislike about the Kohler. Best of all it has a 3....yes 3 year warranty!!"
Purchased one year ago. Remote started to eat batteries quite frequently. Then stopped working. Controls on side of bidet stopped working also. Don't know what to do next.
"This feature-laden bidet is a wonderful bathroom upgrade. Installation is straightforward for both the seat and the plumbing. the elongated seat is comfortable and hit heats. The cleaning function works; I would prefer a tad more power. the pressure is adjustable but even at the higher setting, it seems very gentle. the dring function is ineffective. yes, there is hot air but unless you have a long time to wait, you will not get dry. The nightlight and auto open/close seat are cool and convenient. the remote is large and easy to use. Visually it has an appealing aesthetic. If you are considering a bidet, this one comes with a wide range of features and provides a mostly satisfactory experience."
Special Amazon price-- great Kohler customer service on a a defective part
"Great product. Easy to install, remote control is nice instead of side panel buttons. Also, remote nice to adjust spray wand in and out for optimal cleansing. Our tp usage has gone way down."
work very good
Love it. It was an easy install and took about 30 min. Easy to use and straight forward.
Works great. The auto seat motion feature is very sensitive but not really an issue
"The remote control acts up, it will keep making the notification sound on its own, as if your there pushing random buttons. Very annoying, only fix is to remove the batteries when it acts up and leave it that way."
"Had the use of a heated TOTO seat in the middle of winter in Central NY. Decided I wanted one, hence this Christmas present for myself. Installation was easy, all parts included. Didn't need clips or an extension cord as the power outlet was within reach. The cord exits to the right of the seat. Controls are on a side panel that gets covered when you sit. I liked the cost for the included features. I didn't want a wireless control. I like the adjustable temp settings- low, med, hi, for water and seat. The instructions warn of high temps for seniors. Medium is about as warm as I'd use. The wash feature states 90 seconds, but that seems long. I've stopped it before it's finished. There is a power-saver setting. The seat inclines several inches toward the tank which took a bit of getting used to. This unit is designed for a round bowl which is shorter than what I was using previously. All in all it functions well, is temp adjustable and warms my tush on 65 degree winter mornings. Love it as much as my heated waterbed."
"I installed this in our main bathroom. What a difference. This bidet has so many features: heated seat, heated water, a dryer, adjustable stream. I was blown away at how nice this is. I don't know how we lived without it at this point. Everything works great, and installing took about 20 minutes - super easy. Two cautions. First, it does require electricity. I had to run an extension cord which does not look great. I will have to get an electrician to put an outlet closer to the toilet. Not Kohler's fault, but something to think about. Second, the seat is somewhat smaller than a typical elongated one. This is due to the electronics on the back of the seat. Not a big issue, just different."
"I had always avoided bidets because I thought it would be hard to install or difficult to use. Neither is true. I was able to install this bidet in about 20 minutes, with no leaks. I was able to begin using it effectively about 5 minutes after that.

It is remarkably easy to use, very effective, and surprisingly full featured at this price point. I do wish that the lowest pressure setting was a bit lower because sometimes it sprays too hard, I took off one star for this (I honestly cannot imagine who could possibly use ""turbo"" mode safely). On the paper front I'd say there are some days it helps me save toilet paper and some days I use more, on balance I think it's about the same use.

If you have it plugged in on the low seat temp and high water temp it will use power 24 hours a day to keep the seat and the water warm at all times. I plugged it into my kill-a-watt to see how much electricity this uses. Over 12 hours, just sitting idle, it used .15 kWh. I calculated that over the course of a year, if I used that feature all year, it would cost me $33 (assuming a cost per kWh of 30 cents). For this price you get to always have a warm seat and warm water waiting, it may be well worth it.

Overall I like having it as an option even though I don't use it every time (mostly due to the pressure coming out being too high).

Note, you can press the little green button for energy saving modes, ""super"" pretty much turns all the standby power off. On that setting the water and seat will start off cold."
"While in Hawaii, the hotel my wife and I stayed at had a bidet. We were scared to use it at first but came home and had to buy one! Of course, most toilets in America are round, and smaller than others around the world so we had to look for a bidet that would fit a small round toilet. This one fits GREAT!! Yes, it is compact and sometimes seems cramped but they made great use of the space they could!

This is a basic bidet with lots of features

1.) Unlimited hot water! I have ran it 4 or 5 times in a row and water is always hot (hooked to cold toilet line)

2.) One of the few I could find with both front and back spray options!!

3.) The dryer actually works GREAT

It is missing a few features but for the price, that is expected. It has no memory, no profiles, no remote. But for the price it has all my wife and I wanted and needed!

Installing was super easy!"
I absolutely LOVE this toilet seat. It took my handyman about 30 minutes to install. The water pressure and seat heater work great!!! I’ll never NOT have one if these in my bathroom!👍🏻
Took a while to get around to this review I purchased this bidet on the Black Friday sale in 2021 as a surprise gift for my wife surprisingly she didn't care for it that much for whatever reason I don't know she never really said she still uses TP I love the thing I haven't used toilet paper since we bought it as far as I'm concerned we can throw any toilet paper we have in the house out the door and we don't need to buy another package of toilet paper ever again this cleans you better than any toilet paper ever will if you move around slightly when it's in it's cleaning mode you help it do a better job cleaning use the turbo setting first and then follow it up with whatever other setting you need there's three settings it's nice not having to sit down on a cold toilet seat finish up with the warm air to dry it might take two times like I said I don't know why my wife is so picky she can be a little strange but this is definitely something that should be in every house in your bathroom and this one has served me well I've had absolutely no problems with it in just about 2 years of use super easy to install plus it's made by a name you can trust Kohler I think you'll be very happy if you buy this one
"Hello There!

Forewarning, You'll need an electrical outlet near your toilet to plug this into. Did not expect to have to drill multiple holes into my drywall to find a place to put an electrical box. I ended up daisy chaining off a box on the other side of the wall. HOWEVER, watch out for vent/water pipes behind your toilet while trying to hook up electrical, I managed to not hit them, but had to open up 3 holes in my wall before I found a good spot.

Also, I had never used a bidet before, so I was surprised to find that it was super nice! The heated seat feature is a fun to have in the winter. Would recommend, but be careful with how much pressure you use on your first time!"
"We got this for a special limited deal price and thank goodness for that! I would’ve hated to pay more.

In the last two months we have added three different bidets/washlets to our three bathrooms (well actually four but the two with remote controls both went back within a month because the remotes failed). Plus we have Toto SW502 B100 at our other home for years and they are still working wonderfully.

I’ve included two pictures of each of the three brands to use as a reference. By outward looks nothing obvious pops out but in use the “Kohler” misses the mark (notice they won’t even put the Kohler brand on this bidet- it’s nowhere to be found on the physical unit).

The differences come in the design and function. When you first sit on the toilet it starts making a humming noise and water start dripping out for a bit.

Con: The control panel is SO small that’s it’s the only bidet (out of 5 we’ve had) that I have to lean over to accurately see the panel.

Con: water spray barely moves forwards and backwards in fact I thought it wasn’t moving at all until I compared between the two extremes. It does move but not enough to be effective and frankly doesn’t have nearly the movement range of all the others we’ve had.

Con: will keep spraying if you get off the seat. Not a real big deal unless you forget to shut it off or if you have grandkids as they get a kick out of hopping on and off the toilet :)

Pros: this toilet has a lot of features that don’t come with the less expensive bidets, features like water temperature, seat warmer and dryer. It also isolates the water spray.

So bottom line is that this one works yet not as well as similarly priced competitors. And the design and function don’t match the Kohler brand name; hence which is maybe why they don’t actually put their brand name on this one.

Maybe the Kohler name went down the drain with this model 😂"
This bidet works. Feels cheap compared to a different brand previously purchased. Had to return previous brand due to not working properly. So hopefully this works longer than a month. Needs better water pressure.
"Works as expected, installs easily if you have power where you need it."
"Bought one during covid. Easy to install but you need to wire an outlet within 3 feet of the bowl. The warm seat is heavenly but warm water to wash your butt is essential. Yes I am old and I have hemorrhoids but try it, you will love it."
"Warm water, warm seat, a fan, options ! Perfect in every way."
"Love that the seat is heated! I'm using way less toilet paper! The only thing I don't use much is the dryer. It takes too long. But overall, I love it!"
"The good:
Pretty easy to install with just a screwdriver and a crescent wrench.
All hoses are provided, including ""T"".
Provides adjustable warm water.
The heated seat is nice.
Hinges are soft closing so no more slamming the lid down.
Self-cleaning function.
Sturdy unit once installed, and all bolts tightened.

The not-so-good:
Dryer doesn't dry - unless you want to be there for 20 minutes. Fan is very weak.
Buttons sometimes have to be pushed several times to function.
You need an outlet very close or use an extension cord, which is somewhat unsightly.

Overall, worth the money. I bought one for my girlfriend who is going through some surgeries that limit her ability to rotate her torso and shoulders. You never know what you can't do, until you can't do it.

She loves the product and I agree that it does what it's supposed to do (except for the drying) and does a very good job of it.

If you've never used a bidet, you're in for a surprise. It takes some getting used to. You'll still need a small amount of TP if you want to get dry in a timely manner, so don't throw it out or give it all away just yet.

I liked it enough that I bought one for each of our houses.

We'll see how well it holds up."
Have been pretty happy with this unit for the most part. But now at 6 months the seat warmer has started not working. Let me tell ya in January thats 50% of the reason for having this!
"I am happy with the purchase, it was easy to install and had all the parts I needed to install it. Glad I got the electric one, when I use the warm water it stays warm for the entire time and this alone makes it worth getting the electric one, not to mention the heated seat is nice on cold days.
I didn't want one with a remote control and this seat doesn't have one, I felt it would be a constant battle to find it when you needed it.
The air dryer works but doesn't completely get you dry which isn't an issue for me since I don't use it that much, it will run for up to 5 minutes but who wants to sit there that long to air dry."
"I've been using this for two months and really don't know how I've gotten by all these years without one! I was considering an actual bidet for a new home, but adding the extra fixture seems a waste of space. A bidet toilet seat makes more sense not only for saving space, but also from an ergonomic point of view. The idea of moving off the toilet to squat over a bidet seems odd when you can remain seated and accomplish the same cleansing task. Seat and water temp can be set to your comfort as can the water pressure. Overall cleaning is pretty good.
However the blow drying function is not going to dry you adequately without some degree of wiping, or rather blotting up some of the wetness first. My only dislike is more an issue with fit on the particular round front bowl I have it installed on. Note how the seat is bulkier at the rear as needed to house all components. That pushes the opening in the seat forward as well as your sitting position. The result is my manhood is too near the porcelain for my liking. An elongated style bowl should solve that problem (make sure you order the correct seat for your bowl type). Installation was not too difficult other than adding the receptacle for powering the seat. I could not use the supplied t-fitting and one of two water supply lines because my water supply comes through the wall too close to the water connection on the toilet tank. I had to turn off the water to the house and change to a shut off valve with two supply line connections - one to the tank, and one to the seat."
"This is a nice bidet for the price. after a little over 2.5 years, it started to act funny. It worked when it felt like it and sometimes after trying it a few times. I reached out to Kohler and after a few questions, they replaced it under warranty. Nice!"
"Have bought 2 of these now.

Once you have tried, you will never go back."
"Holy cow! What a difference in the way I feel compared to just wipes toilet paper!
It's a little small but it gets the job done!
This was a great Prime Day deal!"
"Fairly easy to install, even though I have mobility issues. Plugged it in and it worked right away, just as advertised. Great options as far as heat (both water and dryer), seat heater, and water jet options. After using this I don't think I'll ever be happy with ""just another toilet seat"". One word of caution for male users...there is a heated dryer that blows warm air, but you will still likely have to use TP to dry certain dangling stuff. Just a little. But that's a small sacrifice for the overall cleansing and refreshing options the seat offers."
Installation through application—happy customers. Now we have a line to use the bathroom. 😂 Get the suggested cord.
"1) don't overtighten the plastic t-connector!! The connection to the bowl is plastic and breaks very easily. Our Home Depot doesn't carry any t-connectors. I managed to epoxy it for a day while I overnighted a new all-metal connectors.
2) even though this says it's for a round toilet (I have a Rialto low profile), it still hangs over the toilet and doesn't line up with the round hole of the toilet bowl. I checked the box to make sure the right model was sent. Apparently it was the right model. It's only slightly rounded.
3) wasn't as comfortable as I was expecting because the height in the back raises the seat in the back, pushing you forward.
I'm going to keep it, but wasn't as thrilled as I had hoped I would be."
"Great Korean bidet product matching the Novita model I used to have when living in South Korea. A Western barbarian no longer my rear side stays clean, warm, and comfortable. These things are so great. It's not perfect all the time, I leave it on eco mode to save energy so there is a lead time from when you sit (it can detect you sitting, somehow, kind-of sorcerous if you ask me) to when the seat gets toasty but it is only a few seconds, similar thing and again probably because of eco mode it does take a moment for the water to heat or you might get a bit of cold water followed by warmth. Just something I thought folks might want to know. You can leave it on all the time as I did in Korea for maybe 3 years but I wanted this unit to last indefinitely so I'm being more cautious.

If you've never had one of these before you're in for quite a treat and you probably will not even want to use a restroom anywhere else. This was the first time actually installing it myself, overseas I hired a plumber, but eventually I was able to hook it up, the install booklet was not 'as' intuitive as I would prefer as they do not label the parts very well but overall install took 30mins for me and has maintained all its seals with no leaks of water.

Seldom do products made of plastic have a high quality feel to them. This does. This is meant to last with many many uses, for years. If you're on the fence about it, no need, I've never regretted having one and always regret when I don't. I hunted specifically for this version too as someone with experience due to past (and present) positive experience with build quality and reliability."
"Obviously purchased for the women in the house. This one requires nearby outlet which necessitated hiring an electrician. Thereafter, all good with warm water, adjustable pressure, decent price, American sourced (maybe)."
"Looked a bidet attachments but they required the hookup of a cold and hot water line if you wanted warm water. This product requires cold water only and heats the water for you, even allows you to adjust the temperature. Had to install a new outlet behind my toilet. Figured that was easier than running a new hot water line. Other than that, installation was simple and straightforward. Just plug in and it is ready to go. Decided to get one because we recently took a trip to Italy and there was a bidet in our hotel bathroom. Much more hygienic than TP alone if you think about it. Nice upgrade for any bathroom."
"Thoroughly enjoyed our Bidet while it lasted. We bought it in April of 2020 -- when toilet paper was in short supply ;) -- but, as others found, it stopped working after 3 1/2 years ... just after the warranty.

In my case, it still released a trickly of water when sitting down, but only the water temperature LED was lit, on the middle setting ... all other LEDs were off and none of the buttons worked, not even the water temperature. Unplugged multiple times, sometimes for days, and when plugging it in, all the LEDs cycled through like normal, but it always ended up as I mentioned above. I have pressed all combination of buttons hoping to jump start this thing, but sadly, it works no longer.

Due to the type of Kohler toilet we have, we will probably purchase another as others will not fit. But if your toilet will support other brands, you may want to look around for another that might last longer.

Otherwise, when it worked, this bidet was super simple and useful -- I would have given it 5 stars. But having to buy another every 3 1/2 years ... 2 stars is all I can give."
Seat works well so far. Install was fairly simple and straightforward. All the options for settings is nice and not really missing the auto open/close. Only issue is that the back curves up and therefore not a completely ‘flat’ seating set up. Does make the bathroom lights flicker on initial sitting.
"Not as round as my toilet and had the unit as far back as it would go and hung over the front some and would have kept, but noticed when lifting the seat the entire seat assembly moved. Considered putting some foam pads under the assembly in the back in front of the bracket which would have stopped this, but this is a toilet and the padding could become soaked with urine. My bowl is perfectly flat and the install bracket raises the unit up a tad thus causing problem of the entire assembly moving by simply raising the seat. I was concerned this unnecessary movement over time will lead to breaks. I am sure my toilet is not special and this is common on all toilets. The movement could have easily been prevented if this was properly designed so the back of the unit was supported properly taking into consideration the bracket the seat attaches to raises the back of the unit off the toilet a tad. Not round; could have lived with that, but plastic being stressed over and over means it will be eventually breaking."
Had trouble finding a round seat. Most offer oblong seat. This one fit good. Easy install. Works fantastic. Easy to adjust to your own preference. Wife loves it.
This bidet is easy to assemble; has several settings you can change to your preference and is easy to clean. Perfect!
"Product itself is good for the price, but Amazon lists features that it does not have. There is no led nightlight and no automatic operating lid, so stars were removed more because of amazon than the actual bidet. The unit itself functions well. Seat stays warm, as does the water. Install is very easy, although it does sit further forward than the normal seat, which is a bit inconvenient on a round toilet."
Works great
"For the price, it's absolutely amazing. I looked at other models from other companies but read that they only provide 40-50 seconds of warm water and that was a deal breaker for me because I live in a place where the tap water is ice cold in the winter. This heats water in real time so it doesn't run out and you don't have to wait.

The dryer isn't very effective but from my research, even the high-end ones struggle in this area and we're okay with drying off in other ways. If the dryer actually worked I would totally give 5 stars.

I have an elongated toilet and this fits just fine - the position is adjustable during installation. At first I had placed it a little too far back but once I looked at it again I realized I could loosen it, move it forward, and re-tighten so I did - no sweat. Installation was a cinch. if you search the model number online there is nice video review of it that answers most questions and there is also manufacturer's installation video which helped me make my decision and complete the installation.

The buttons are responsive and the cycles fit my all needs. Some people complain that it doesn't 'remember' your favorite nozzle positions but it's not an issue for us because we generally use the oscillation function on both types of wash.

All in all we love it and will be buying one for each bathroom."
"Pros: It has a lot of features that similar bidets charge more for like heated water/ heated seats/ dryer.
Cons: The seat itself seems small when you are sitting on it, but it’s still comfortable. I have a round toilet and bought the round version, yet if looking directly down at toilet, you can see part of the front rim.
It doesn’t have nightlight or self opening/closing lid which the seller describes as a included feature. I believe that is an error on the seller’s description."
"It’s a bidet. No it doesn’t sing to you or welcomes you with speeches when you sit on it but it gets the job done. Easy to assemble to you toilet. Also, no dryer :l (from what I’ve noticed while using it for months)."
"Fits my one piece round (circa 1991) Kohler Rialto toilet (which I love). Easy to install, just take your time and you will be pleased.

Great bidet features (heated seat and water, oscillation feature), with easy to use remote attached to the seat, with self-closing lid.
Good quality/value, easy to install with three year Kohler Manufacturer Warranty. This is made by Novita in North Korea for Kohler.

A toilet bidet is a game changer, and until you try one, as I did in an oceanfront Waikiki hotel, you may never think about it. BuT(T) once you DO, you will find it is the only way To Go.

Feeling clean is a liberating experience, and this product is just that.

In the immortal words ofJack Lord aka the real Hawaii Five-O Steve McGarrett: Be There... Aloha."
"Yep, a built in bidet is a no brainer for people who come from the middle east. We grew up using them and we simply can't live with out them. So we need them to have good pressure and they need to have an adjustable angle. So all the features work well with two exceptions: the highest pressure isn't high enough and I used it in Buffalo NY where the water pressure in the bathroom is already very good. The second flaw is that the angle adjusting doesn't seem to properly work, or it's range is too small I almost can't feel any difference. Otherwise, this is a perfect device."
"The bidet fits the 1999 Kohler Rialto one piece toilet. Due to round shape of toilet, you will loose about 1.5"" in front or 2"" in back. The toilet opening became quite small. All the controls and features work well. If you can live with small opening, this bidet works well."
"very good, very comfortable and easy to assemble."
"This is the best bidet toilet seat for the money i have seen. Have 2 personally. Im a licensed contractor 25 years but the install is simple for anyone with minimal reading skills. The features are unheard of at this price point. His & hers wash, heated seat and air dryer, adjustable self clean nozzle, etc. It says made by Kohler but the seat is stamped with the name Novita. I was skeptical at 1st but purchased a 2nd 6 months later. Original one is @ 1 year old, no issuse except it would not fit on my RV toilet or id buy a 3rd, LOL. Highly recommend."
"The only reason why I purchased this seat, and not others that had a more attractive price, was that the product description said it had a deodorizer. Our other Toto washlets have a deodorizer fan and carbon filter and that was something we wanted to get. I had this Novita seat installed and this model doesn't have a deodorizer fan (not to be confused with the dryer fan). False advertisement..."
My only issue is if you’re a man of average or larger size you will need to deal with your “equipment” hanging off the ledge. A very minor inconvenience though.
"This product is awesome! I could write an essay singing it’s praises, but will keep it short. The heated seat, warm air & water are amazing as the rest of the features. The only minimal negative for me is the micro burst of cool water, short cord for those with toilet closets & no outlet, and the size of the round could be a bit more accommodating. Also, the description states a toilet bowl light but there is not one - not a deal breaker by any means!
Bonus: It is a healing experience for those with medical issues.
IMO: I wish they were a standard feature in US toilets so everyone could experience the numerous benefits."
Super easy to assemble...have been using for over 3 months not a single complaint
"I bought this for my wife, we mainly use it for the seat warmer. It doesn’t work, or it take too long to work. By the time it started to get warm, 5 minutes would of been pass and our butt probably warm the seat instead.

Would not recommend"
Finally completed the bathroom where this is installed. We did put in the outlet for it. I love it. Even my husband loves it
Used this for about a week before we noticed the water was coming out cold. Sometimes warm no matter what we set the water temp to. Kohler too very unhappy.
its awesome but look into your toliet seat measurements to make sure this isnt too big
Like the bidet even though have only had it one day. Easy transaction and quick delivery.
"Play Video
 Got the item. Packaging looked fine. All parts present. Installed according to directions. Plugged in. Power cycled on. Turned on water and tested. Heated seat, check. Water spray, check. Then, part of the way through it's first ""use"" the lights all started flashing and the water temp got so hot that I had to get off the damn seat for fear of getting scalded. Then the LED panel started flashing like a Christmas tree..... A hateful, b-hole burning, Christmas Tree.

While I appreciate a sanitized b-hole, I don't think it should be getting the water quite that hot. I don't need a stream clean. It's a good thing it was me and not my wife.

Then the thing shut off and will not power back on.

After a long reset it powered back on. But any time I try to use the warm water at ANY setting, it overloads a sends searing hot water into no-man's land.

Hopefully this is not indicative of the product line as-a-whole....

But seriously, please fix this. That was uncomfortable."
"This works great. My wife had a rough delivery and this helped her through her recovery. It holds up great one month in, and is easy to clean and use."
"Works great and overall fits what I wanted on it... I'm surprised that these are not more common in the us... I personally have never used one before, but my gf has been wanting one...

It has all the features except the toilet light that some others have... As far as performance goes without being gross let's just say the water pressure is great as it has been able to handle everything I've thrown at it... And then the dryer is a great feature as with this I don't even need to wipe...

The only downside, but I knew this ahead of time was the overall size of the seat... I'm 6'1 and for me it's a bit small to the point that if I don't control the front my stuff will touch the bowl but I knew it was smaller but since I live in apartment it seems those tolets are on the smaller size... The only other con that can possibly be one is the remote is attached to the seat, but for me I wanted it attache to it as my dog loves destroying my remotes so it would only be a matter of time."
After nr two
Easy to install and operate. Not too many functions. Water temp good. Fan good enough. No problems installing. Longevity is a will see but built well.
I liked it so much I bought 3 of the for all the bathrooms in the house
It was very easy to install. Works perfectly and features are nice but the seat is so extremely tiny
""
"I have used a bidet for years. My previous bidet was cold water only and recently died. I figured it was a good time to upgrade. I love the oscillating feature, and the warm seat. Also the nozzle retracts to keep clean. So worth the money! I also upgraded my toilet for a comfort height model as my old one was so low my knees hurt every time I used it. My old toilet was a Kohler and so is the new one and this bidet looks and fits great! Going this route with buying the toilet and bidet separately was so much cheaper than buying the fancy toilet with the bidet that starts at $700 and goes up from there. I got my toilet for $165 at Home Depot, and this bidet for $255, and Amazon had the bidet to me the next day!"
"Installation was pretty easy, but don't lose the rubber washers that are inside one end of the hose, and one end of the T-adapter. The controls, though, are very confusing. The big red button that says ""stop turbo"" is not, in fact, an emergency stop button. Sometimes when you press it, it actually increases the squirt. (Don't stand in front of the toilet while you test it, like I did!) The ""bidet"" button also makes no sense. Isn't the whole device a ""bidet""? And how is that button supposed to be different from the other control buttons? The green ""Eco"" button is also mis-labeled. The ""super"" position means ""super eco"", not, as I would've expected, ""super performance"". My wife likes the product, but I don't."
"Almost didn't buy the Kohler Novita because one of the reviews said the dryer was weak and wouldn't do the job. Glad we bought it anyway. This thing does a great job and 1/2 the cost of our friends Toto model. The dryer works great! In fact, if you're not careful, it will burn your booty."
Easy to install. Great product
"This bidet is nice. The adjustable water temp and pressure are great features. As is the heated seat.
Easy to install. It does effectively reduce bowl size circumference even on an elongated commode.

The dryer air is NOT heated. Which results in somewhat negating the warm water when cold air blows across your wet bum.

It did require an additional GFCI outlet nearby, as noted in product information.

Overall, it's a nice addition to mom's remodeled bathroom."
Absolutely love this bidet! Heated seat in the colder months! Warm water to freshen up and easy clean.
"Look, if you factor in the amount of time you spend in the RR you owe yourself a comfortable relaxing experience.

I know you’re thinking… it’s a toilet seat that’s a lot. But… does your car warm your seat in the winter? Does your sink heat water? Does your toilet paper save you money? This does all of those things and more."
"So the title is a bit misleading.

This is made by a company that Kohler owns called Novita...a Kohler Company.

Kohler's name is nowhere on the product, only in the title of the product on Amazon, so to be totally honest, I feel just a little bit duped. But I can only assume that Kohler would not have purchased the company unless they sold quality products. And, in all honesty, that's good enough for me, until proven otherwise.

As far as the quality goes, I can't speak to that as of yet because I just installed it.

Whatever happens with it, I will update my review."
I have had this bidet since the end of February 2023 and I have to admit my family and I absolutely love it!!!!! 😍
"We are loyal customer to Kohler made novita electric bidet seats, 4th was brought due to 1st one was broken after several years of use. Well worth it compared to price.
But the fourth one was not heating up the water and I decided to call Amazon and Amazon connect the call to Kohler tech support. Kohler tech support rep identified to figure out how it can be fixed via over the phone. Kohler tech support and Amazon rep made this process super easy. We are a loyal customer to Kohler due to professionalism of the company and product guarantee."
"So as I said I would like to say it was a pain in the buttocks, but it was not so. The bidet was a gift from heaven. My wife has been on me to get one of these newfound gizmo’s for years, being a manly man I said no way, boy was I wrong.

I relented and after some pursuing of Amazon I can across this beauty. Installation was a breeze took longer to unpack everything, yes it comes that well boxed, with everything you need.

Being a manly man and one who prides himself on his workmanship, I decided to be the first to try it out, being a hemorrhoid, I mean, manly man, hemorrhoids sufferer, it brought tears to my eyes, manly tears of relief. It has been like going from using sandpaper to, well you know what, to being bathed in angel tears. Ahem.....

I digress, it has been a life changer, ladies keep on those manly men of yours and get one of these beauties, manly men, do your self a favor and listen to the ladies in your life and you will be happy as the preverbal pig."
The round seat looks like a compact elongated seat to me. It does not really fit my Kohler one-piece round toilet. I like the brand but not sure if I should keep it or find another one which can better fit my toilet.
I have one exactly like this model. I bought this one for my son’s birthday. Absolutely the BEST bidet seat on the market! My son loves his. And his 3 year old daughter won’t use any other toilet in the house!
"It takes about 15 minutes to install. The directions are easy to follow and clear.
Turn off water, remove feed line from toilet, install the T, attach feed to t. Install the bracket and seat, then attach the water line to the seat, plug it in and youre good to go.
The only complaint Ive got is related to the seat placing you further forward which causes some collision with the bowl. Men will understand what I mean by that. Even so, I will always have one of these in my house now."
"Like it and perfect size for my toilet, for now function well"
"I’ve had several Toto Washlets that lasted for years and years that I leave working In houses and apartments I’ve sold. Now I’m renting and I have junked this unit after about 8 months using it after buying it from Amazon. The spray isn’t strong enough to clean you throughly and the water doesn’t really get hot enough to be optimal. I was dealing with it, but then it started to leak water all over the floor when spraying and was getting worse. I’m pretty handy and have changed “O” rings on washlets before (like washers, basically), but this problem wasn’t an “O” ring, it was leaking from the inside of the mechanism. I took it apart but couldn’t figure it out and threw it on the dumpster after 8 months. Also: when I opened it up to try to fix it, it had serious mold on the internal workings. I don’t think this is really a Kohler item, just something a Chinese manufacturer sold th on and makes for them tailored to the US market and plumbing and toilet sizes. Spend another $100-$200 and get a TOTO. Even if the TOTO is made in China they’ll exercise great control over the factory and quality. I’ve never had quality problems through 4-5 TOTO units."
My butt is so clean it's ridiculous never going back
"I’m sure there are better bidets out there, but for what I paid during Black Friday ($144), I am very pleased with the product. My wife and I recently had nasty preschool stomach virus that had us going to the bathroom every 20 minutes. Without this bidet, our behinds would be a wreck. Pretty easy to set up, very easy to use, and it works as it should. This is my first and only bidet, so I have nothing to compare it to. But my wife and I love it and would highly recommend it."
"First time user. Seems pretty effective. I wish it had a complete cycle button (wash and dry) so you could push a single button. As it is, it has a complete wash cycle, but you have to choose to dry each time.

It does shorten the useful length of the seat by a few inches (we have elongated model on elongated toilet). If you feel cramped on an elongated toilet, you won't like this. I got used to it pretty quick.

In the winter, we leave it in economy (but not super-economy) mode which keeps the seat very slightly warm and the water at a decent temp. Seat heats up a bit more as you use it. In the summer, I'd likely turn that off.

Air drying is only mildly useful - typically pat off with a few squares of TP."
"This is the first item that I have bought from Amazon that has caused me to be more cautious when buying from Amazon. The description clearly states that this bidet has both a LED Nightlight, and an auto open and close lid. However, this is NOT TRUE! I am contemplating whether or not to have my husband remove it and send it back due to this FALSE ADVERTISING. One of the main reasons for ordering this unit was the two missing components. Very aggravating and disappointing!"
"I don't want to replace my Kohler Rialto toilet but need a washlet. This size fits perfectly with curves at back for french curved one piece toilet. Easy to install but feel small and tight for the opening hole even by my kid, and seat is leaning forward slightly. Rate 4 for the price and compatible to french curves."
Backside never been so clean. Getting so many compliments. The flies are leaving me alone now too.
"If it breaks tomorrow, I’ll order another one."
"This is not the best bidet out there but for the price it is solid. Temps and pressure are fine but don’t clean as well as higher end models I have used. The dryer doesn’t do much. But if on a budget, this is a solid option."
The bidet is perfect!! Easy to install too.
"Promised features were: • Electric Bidet: Features includes warm-air drying, mulit-setting heated sea, LED Nightlight, and auto open and close lid; Hybrid heater technology provides instant and unlimited warm water for consistent comfort.
• Self Cleaning Nozzle and Air Deodorizer: Stainless-steel wand automatically rinses after each use while a powerful, chemical-free, carbon filter air deodorizer automatically minimizes odors.
•
Stated that 2 AA batteries required, however no place to place batteries or instructions for batteries.
No LED night light or auto open and close lid. Remote is in a awkward position, you have to turn sidewise to reach it. I am returning this item and ordering a different brand. I feel misled on this product, this was for my guest bathroom and I really wanted the nightlight."
Works great
"Upgraded from my $25 bidet attachment and I’m kinda regretting it.

Pros:

Heated Seat
No hot water line needed
Easy to install
Controllable temp and spray

Cons:

Small Seat- The seat isn’t too small. It FEELS too small. The raised hump in the back forces you forward on the seat and could cause the most dreaded scenario for men sitting on a toliet (and Seinfeld thought it was gross when your belt buckle hit the inside of the toliet!)

Broken Power Saving Mode- Mine stays on but the seat always feels warm. So can’t tell if it’s already on or doesn’t work.

Front of the seat- It makes contact with the bowl, not on the legs On the side but at the front right where urine would hit if the guy lifts the seat. So then the bottom of the seat gets covered in urine.

Weak fan- Let’s be real, that fan isn’t drying anything off. Maybe a tiny bit.

I was expecting it to be a lot better than it is. Might even go back to my old unit."
"Seat material is delicate and marks easily. Controls are not intuitive (stop button also triggers a turbo setting that is easy to accidentally turn on). Response to button presses is much slower than alternatives. Self cleaning function started leaking water, a continual drip, after about 1 year of use."
"It is hard to find a seat that fits an American Standard toilet that isn't just too big. This is the best unit I found by far. Even then I still sit kind of far forward on the seat. Be sure to take that factor into account when buying a bidet seat, or your male users will 'overshoot' the edge of the toilet.
Update: I didn't think much about the seat warmer feature when I bought this, but it is *nice* when the weather turns cold. This one doesn't turn on or off automatically, but even if you have to turn it off yourself, it is a nice feature on a cold day."
"It’s really good to eliminate the mud butt but don’t forget about swamp balls guys, it’s definitely cleaner but still unusual having anything going on back there. No offense to people that like stuff going on back there."
"This bidet performs quite well and has solid features (air dryer, aerated water, steel nozzle) for a good price. It has a presence sensor, which will turn off the water / air dryer if no one is seated, but it takes several seconds to kick in. In addition, one flaw is that the ""stop"" button on the controller also acts as the ""turbo"" button. So if you accidentally press the stop button twice, the seat starts spraying water. This resulted in two times where I was pressing stop to stop the air dryer and accidentally triggered the water to start spraying again as I stood up."
Great seat. Great customer service! Highly recommend
"Everything about this is wonderful - wish I had gotten one earlier. Except, the seat is sooooo small! It is a bit uncomfortable. I guess you compromise seat size after it packs in all the mechanics. This is my first bidet seat, so maybe they’re all like that. Otherwise, wonderful. So glad I went for all the bells and whistles (heated seat, heated dryer, etc.) Took less than 30 minutes to install. GFCI outlet and water line were right next to the toilet, though, and that made the difference."
This is a great bidet. I really have no complaints.
"The seat leaks from a small hole on the side the controls are on. The leak starts as soon as you sit on the seat. I can't find out what is wrong. The leak is inside the seat and there is no access to it. Press the spray button and the water just gushes out. I have to keep a bucket under it. Going to have to buy a new toilet seat to replace this so I can take it off. Have to find a box to send it back. This terrible. Started out fine and I do like it but the leaking is just too much. Gets worse every time I use it. Owners manual and installation guide are no help.
I do not recommend this bidet seat."
"I like all the features, the only thing I would change is to move the control panel over 3-4 inches. It is a little too close to the seat but the more I use it the easier it is. The sprays are perfectly aligned and the temperature is just right."
Cleansing bottoms
So far so good. No issues with the seat . Water Pressure wasn’t what I expected at first but as I used I realized it’s good enough and maybe more pressure would just have splashes coming out of the bowl which I don’t want . Happy with my purchase so far
Love this bidet. It was really easy to install and it works great! Warm water and warm seat! It’s a great price too!
This is the second Novita seat installed in our house. It was very easy to install (I had the GFI outlets installed next to the toilets when the house was built). First one was installed two years ago and still works great. Wanted to complete the project in the alternate bathroom on the first floor. I have to admit the seat warmer is a nice thing to have - especially in the colder months.
"Looks neat and works well. Giggled for the first few uses as never used a bidet like this before only the euro faucet versions.
Will make use of heated seat in the winter no doubt but for now not using that function. Good to be able to choose the temp and flow of water. Has made a world of difference to my lavatory routine and leaves you feeling (and being) cleaner than TP alone"
"First of all, if you are at all on the fence about buying a bidet, go for it. I strongly recommend it! I really miss mine when I am not at home. It has become the kind of convenience that I never want to have to live without. A friend used it and said, ""Wow, that is a game changer.""

I own both this bidet, and the Brondell s1000, that I bought a few years ago. I really like the Brondell brand (although to be fair, I haven't tried any others), in large part because the toilet seat, when closed, can be sat on. (The website says the weight limit of the L99 toilet lid is 160 pounds. The weight limit of the Swash lid is 270 pounds. They look the same to me, but what do I know. Go with what the manual says. The weight limit of the seat when open - e.g. not the lid - is 330 pounds.) I never actually sit on my closed toilet seat, but I used to do it all the time when my kids were small (supervising them in the bathroom), and it's nice to know that a) if I wanted to I could, and b) I don't have to worry that other people who use my bathroom might sit on a closed toilet seat and break it.

This model was not available when I bought my Swash 1000. To be honest, I like the Swash 1000 better. But it is also more that twice the price of this model, and the things that are better about it are not worth that much to me. I would rather buy two of this one, and I would be perfectly satisfied and even have a little money left over.

I think the heater is better on the Swash 1000. My impression is that the warm water is more consistent. I suspect that I could run it all day and the water would be the same temperature all the time. With the L99, there is a slight variability in water temperature. Nothing that is problematic, but I think the heater on the other model is probably better. I also like the remote better on the S1000. The buttons are somewhat raised, and it is just a little bit less sensitive, so you only ""turn it on"" when you really mean to. I have changed seat temperature and water temp on this one just by brushing up against the remote. (The water doesn't turn on unless you are sitting on the seat, so that is not an issue on either model.) Again, not a deal breaker, and certainly not worth over $300, but still something worth noticing. Finally, the s1000 sounds quieter and smoother when it is operating. The L99 makes a somewhat startling sound when it starts up.

The seat is very comfortable. I really like that the seat is heated. The water temp is comfortable. (Warm water makes a difference. I have tried both, and definitely prefer using warm water.) I didn't care one way or another about the night light when making the purchase (the s1000 doesn't have one), but I like it. I like that the nozzle is stainless steel. That may be my imagination but it just feels more sterile than a plastic nozzle. I really like that the nozzle is self-cleaning. The bidet was easy to install, even with modifications that I had to make because I have a skirted toilet. It's a little more work to clean than a regular toilet seat, because you have to pop the whole seat off the mounting plate that it sits on to clean underneath it, but again, not hard to do and certainly not a deal breaker. (You have to do that for both models.)

Overall, this is a well priced bidet with a lot of high quality features. Highly recommended."
"I love it! I will sometimes wait until i get home to use the bathroom now lol. I feel SO much cleaner when i use it. I waited about a month before writing this just to give it a very fair review since its a pricier purchase. And I really relied on the other reviews when I purchased it - so I hope my review helps someone else.
My thoughts:
The seat gets toasty warm! I didnt anticipate this really mattering but this is one of things i love most and am very spoiled by. And although my other very american family (lol) doesnt particularly like their nether regions being showered on the potty, they DO LOVE the seat warmer. The water gets nice and warm too (although if you use the full three minute wash, it cools down quite a bit but not to an uncomfortable level). The spray is plenty strong (especially when you use the “strong” option). I read this in a few other reviews and mine does this too - it does make my bathroom light subtly flicker a little when its filling but its not major and doesnt bother me. I wish it sprayed just a liiiitttttttllleee farther front but i just scoot back a little on the seat to accommodate for that. It was very easy to install but i did have to order an extension cord - I ziptied the excess and used sticky 3M style cord clamps to keep the cord neat and out of sight. Its not difficult at all to clean/clean around. Its aesthetically nice looking. The seat top is sturdy and you CAN sit on it but because of the angle, it isnt super sittable (i used to sit on the toilet seat to do things like put on my socks and lotion up after my bath…its not real comfy for things like that though so I do miss having a “seat” in my bathroom). I also kind of wish the buttons on the remote “clicked” but thats just me being picky - the remote works well and even without “clicks” I dont have any trouble operating it. As some of the other reviews said, the dryer really doesnt dry but if you do a little pat is does help keep you from feeling “damp” down there. That being said, i haven’t read a review yet that said the dryer really did a good job - even on the much pricier seats. All things considered though, I think this bidet seat is an excellent value! I shopped this purchase for MONTHS (maybe even a year) before I finally committed and Im very happy with this choice!"
"It’s a great alternative to using toilet paper.
Pros:
-Adjustable water temperature
-Adjustable heated seat
-Remote is an excellent convenience
-Saves your backside from harsh toilet paper
-Fairly simple installation
Cons:
-Slight Learning curve to use
-Air dryer is all but useless
-Time consuming to use
-May require a learning curve for install

My wife and I needed an alternative to toilet paper for a couple of reasons: the great toilet paper shortage of 2020 and medical conditions. This is our first experience with a bidet so I can’t compare it to other options but I can tell you about this particular model. We got the set with the remote and dryer (there are options without these features you can deject from). The remote is a must. You can mount it in a convenient location and this seat has enough buttons you don’t want to be fumbling around with buttons to the right and back while sitting on the throne. The nozzle position is adjustable but will also require you to slightly move for it to be effective. The water temperature options are great so you don’t have cold (especially winter) water spraying at you bottom. The air dryer is like trying to dry off after a shower with a cheap hair dryer, so you will be an option to pat dry. You can use a wash cloth, towel or make some cloth towelettes for the purpose. After patting dry the air dryer can finish the job so the dryer option is not completely useless—just all but. The biggest downside is you will be sitting around for an additional 2 to 4 minutes compared to using toilet paper.
Installation was no big deal for me. If you have ever changed a toilet seat and the innards of you toilet tank, this is about as difficult. Institutions are easy to follow, so if this is your first time messing with toilet parts, it is simple enough any minimal effort to follow instructions will get the job done. You just need an electric outlet within a reasonable distance of the seat or you will need to install one. I didn’t have one, but I was able to pull electric from a nearby switch box and install an outlet. If you don’t know how to do this, and electrician should be able to do it for you at a reasonable cost. Regular sized toilets should accommodate this seat. Just make sure your toilet fits within the dimensions outlined in the description. (There are super large elongated toilets and super small round toilets so measure twice and order once. You may not always be able to change your toilet easily and still meet local building codes.)

UPDATE: Also a con is durability. I’m now on number 3. The first one broke after 18 months of use. The seat began cracking which I figured may have been a fluke. The second one lasted almost 12 months before the water heater stopped working. These things are complicated machines with a lot that can go wrong, so expect something to break within a couple of years of use. Two people use my bidet so if it’s just one person using, maybe you can get double the longevity. Even with the durability problem, it pays for itself in toilet paper savings in about a year, so it’s not a total ripoff."
"This bidet is really something. It is packed with features and super easy to install. Fits my older toilet perfectly. The design allows for a lot of adjustment options without having the seat attached. That makes finding the perfect position when installing a breeze. Once installed it stays put and does not move even slightly. That is thanks to the quality anti slip strips on the seat mounting bracket. The remote is very nice. I love the ability to store two user settings. Once programmed you never need to adjust the settings again. Simply push the user 1 or 2 button and viola you are good to go, no pun intended. Great array of water pressures, temperatures, and nozzle locations. It even has different spray patterns. The heated water lasts for a full 2 minute wash cycle but I have not needed two minutes yet. The hottest setting is plenty hot too. Both the lid and seat are soft close. The seat heater is a luxurious feature but it does not automatically shut off. Would be nice to have the heater sense when you sit and shut down when you are done but it’s not a deal breaker. I also love the heated drier feature. You must keep in mind that it is normal to have residual moisture. The soft blue light is great and it can also be disabled. Haven’t used a single piece of TP since I installed my bidet. It’s a nice feeling to know I am helping the environment AND getting cleaner at the same time. I also purchased the in-line water filter and am just as pleased with it. This is a quality product made by a reputable company. It’s worth every penny. I don’t think you can find a more feature packed bidet for the price. Buy with confidence."
"I love the ease of use and fairly simple install. All the great features (heated seat, heated water, pressure control and the night lights actually pretty dang effective.

I don't care for the somewhat touchy remote that seems to blow through batteries every month or so.

For you naysayers. I was one of you. Thought ""man I don't need to get water shot up my rump, this is silly.""
Bought it for my wife as she had to have one. She wanted some basic wand thing. I saw the reviews on this and all the features and decided if I was gonna get something I'm getting something that will make her life easier.

I now use it. It's an absolute life saver if you get turbo dump/gut rot.
Prior to owning: after a few liquid dookies your butt gets raw and we all know pooping is miserable chore with a raw butt.

After acquiring: I got sick with a nasty stomach bug. Turbo dumping seemingly ever hour or so. This thing made that period of time virtually painless.

It's a fantastic product and I am considering acquiring another for our other bathroom."
"I have rectal cancer on my anal verge. I'm just finishing radiation which if you can imagine have a 3rd degree or more sunburn where your toilet stuff comes out, it hurts!! I got to the point where I couldn't even wipe with paper or medicated wipes anymore. I was so looking forward to the comfort of this bidet.

Well, excited, installed very easily and wow, that first gentle spray of lukewarm water was incredible! I finally could use the bathroom again and have a #2.

So, we've had this thing now for about five days and I've so enjoyed it and it's helped my healing. That is until today. It just decided to stop working!! Miserable! The little spot would come out, spray for 5 seconds and go back in again. I reset several times, mind you with a bottom full of pop! I even got to the point where it appeared if I wasn't sitting on it, it worked, but if I sat on it, it worked. It felt like the device knew I was hurting and wasn't going to work.

Also, I should have known better. From day one, the remote has really been funky. You'd press a button five times to get any function to work. I learned that it has a little IR received of all places on the back of the unit so when the seat is up, you must aim the remote directly at behind the seat. That fixed the remote problem.

Needless to say, this was a hope not gained and returned this unit! I won't be buying anything from Brondell again.

Oh, they do have tech support, but email only."
"What I like: Super easy installation. I like the water pressure, the water temperature, the remote control, and the attached side control. Oh, and the heated seat It’s nice to set your preferences on the remote and then set it to the side and use the attached quick control. Just keep it handy because if the power goes off it erases your preferences. To work the remote you have to hold the buttons you are setting to get them to react, which is smart in case you have children who impatiently try to mash the buttons— they give up quickly. Sometimes I’ve had to move the remote to get a better signal but that’s no big deal and I could only get the settings saved for one user not two. Also the dryer works but I’m not going to sit there long enough to get dry….who has that much time? I use a little tissue to pat dry. I’ve had this for about 5 months and I’m very pleased. The water temperature can be set from cold to very warm almost hot and so can the seat temperature . If you set the water for warm it stays warm and doesn’t run into cold before you are through. You can even change the water pressure. The blue light is just bright enough to go in the middle of the night without turning on the lights. In March when it was still cold it was pleasant to sit on a warm seat ! Overall, I’m very pleased and have recommended it to a few friends already. It’s nice to be clean! Everyone should have one!"
"This did not work for me because apparently I have an old toilet. I double checked that that I ordered a round until. When the plumber put it on, the front overhung so much that a man would not be able to sit and pee comfortably and likely spill outside the toilet. The logo for my American Standard toilet is script. I had the plumber put the original seat back on."
"This is perhaps the one Amazon purchase my husband was initially upset over, and quickly changed his mind.

No more fear of swamp bum.

On a personal level, as a woman,
1.specifically for that time of the month I have found that there is no cleaner feeling than this.
2. On this, I work remotely, full advantage of less dependency of panty liners.
3. TMI, nothing has changed in my life but adding bidet to my life. In the year I have had this, I have not had a UTI.

On this for the temperature, it can vary. Depending how many people use it, how frequently you use it, you can experience some cold water. Due to its natural compact size, the water cycle tank is small, but water heats up between 15 to 20 min.

The fan cycle is an added bonus but not heated air. I personally don’t mind it because it is not intolerable.

Con:
The power cable is short. As a fix, I am using a water resistant extension cord and have hidden this in my bathroom. Hiding the cord for me was more time consuming than installing the seat. I am not recommending anything, this was just my fix

Pros.
Easy to clean. The above. Forget T.P., nothing is cleaner than bidet. And I also sometime get uncomfortable being away from home over and extended period or time."
I love this seat but me being 200 lbs when leaning too far back my weight puts too much pressure on the seat that the washing probe doesn’t come out. I have to intentionally lean forward for it to work.
"It arrived today and I got it quickly installed. It is pretty easy to install actually. I have a $35 bidet on my toilet now so I thought I would save time with using the same hoses, etc but they had different fittings and I had to install what came with the seat. It was still quick and easy though.

A few things I noticed in testing it, some are probably typical of the remote based seats but stood out to me as being pretty different than my turn a knob model:
1) I thought it was broken at first because when I pressed wash, water came out but the nozzle didn’t. Both times I stood up to see what the issue was (I had not used the bathroom, I was just testing it) and it seemed like the nozzle was starting to come out. Turns out it does a “quick” self clean before extending to clean you. I say “quick” because enough time passed twice for me to think it was broken and stood up. This I am sure is typical of these more expensive models so I am saying it’s a con or a pro; just sit there longer than you normally would before thinking something is wrong. It will even eventually extend to clean.

2) The pressure was WAY too low. It was like a water squirt bottle type of pressure. I thought it was on low pressure but it was set to high. My $35 bidet will hit the ceiling if you aren’t sitting on it. That is what I am used to and what I feel comfortable with in terms of cleanliness. So to me this was a big con.

3) it advertises a Sitz bath feature. Be aware that all this means is that is runs with warm water for 5 minutes. Everything I googled and have been told by my doctor is that sitz baths need salt or medications in them. This seat ONLY does warm water so to me that is not a sitz bath at all.

4) The hole is much smaller than a standard seat opening. Quite a few people have mentioned that in their reviews. It isn’t a big deal, but those that want to finish off with toilet paper may find the seat opening challenging.

5) People have asked if you can sit on the lid. Yes you can but it has such an angle to it that it isn’t a place you can really sit to do anything. I had to push on the ground with me feet to keep from sliding off.

6) the drying feature is like a gentle summer breeze and will take just as long to dry your butt as a gentle summer breeze. Bring a book.

7) I didn’t get to test the water temp feature because once I saw how bad the pressure was, I removed it and packed it up for return.

8) I found the remote hard to press the buttons. They aren’t raised buttons but a solid surface (excellent for staying clean) so you have to press kind of hard to trigger it. I found a few times during testing that I had to press stop multiple times to get it to stop.

9) The skin detect feature is, I guess, ok. Several other models had pressure sensors, but this advertises as a skin contact sensor, which I assumed was a pressure sensor, but I don’t think it is. I tested it by standing up slightly. The back of my knee was still touching the seat, but the spray kept going. As I said, I already knew I was going to return it because of the pressure so I didn’t feel the need to test the sensor more. So it either: 1) can detect skin even on the front rim which means make sure it is off before you really stand up, or 2) really slow at stopped if it thinks you got up but like I said I didn’t bother to test this scenario.

So I got this for the warming nature of the seat, water, (yeah that’s right…it’s an Oxford comma) and the dryer. However, to me, it was NOT worth anywhere close to its price for just a warm seat that barely spits at me and has a dryer that blows about as hard as someone who is trying really hard not to blow out a candle. It might be fine for some but not for me."
"First, if you're debating between the LE89 (no remote) and the LE99 (with remote), definitely get the LE99 with remote. We started with the LE89 and quickly returned it because it was a pain to reach and see the controls when they're fixed to the side of the toilet. The remote make everything easier. That said, the remote has a bit of a mind of its own, as some other users have pointed out. For no reason whatsoever the remote will turn your settings to ""eco"" mode, which means the toilet seat won't be warm and the water needs time to heat up. One might dismiss this as a random quirk, but we bought two LE99's and they both do the exact same thing. The good news is, even in ""eco"" mode, the seat heats up fast, as does the water. Though it can be a bit disconcerting when you first sit on the seat and expect it to be toasty and it's cold. Otherwise we love this bidet. The pressure is great, the water temperature is hot and it gets you clean. Some people have complained that the water temperature gets cold too quickly. And it's true, if you run it for the full two minutes, it starts to get cool (not cold) after about 90 seconds. But this thing will clean your butt in about 60 seconds, so you don't need to let it go through the whole two minute cycle, which is a waste of water anyway. So just manually hit off. The dryer is a nice feature, but my wife thinks it's pointless, but I've found that if I use it, I need far less toilet paper to dry off. Plus it feels good! Anyway, if you're in the market for a low cost bidet seat with premium features, look no further, but just be aware of the few issues I pointed out at the top."
"I love my new bidet so much!!! Even though it is far from perfect, it is a real godsend. I have never used a bidet before, and was a little worried whether I would know what to do... but once the water started to spray, I took to it like a duck to water, so to speak. No worries, I figured it out within about three seconds, and I'm sure almost anyone would.

During the COVID-19 lockdown, there is zero TP on the shelves in the Bay Area, and my supply on hand was dwindling. Before it became an emergency, I ordered this unit. Genius idea!!!! It delivered swiftly, and I installed it myself using channel-lock pliers, teflon tape and a screwdriver, with only a moderate amount of difficulty and swear words. The installation video was really worth the effort of looking up to find! The instruction booklet that came in the box was barely useful, although it does map out the remote control reasonably well. While I could understand how to do the installation from the video, achieving it was harder. In the end, the bidet connection only leaks a little bit -- about 2 ounces of clean water per day, hwich I catch in a little bucket.... I think I probably needed to double wrap the metal-to-metal connection with the teflon tape.... Probably I should uninstall it and reinstall it, but... having not great plumbing skills, I am just gonna live with it, cause what if I reinstall it even worse???

The remote control is a genius idea too, because it saves the user from having to twist to press buttons that are behind you while using the bidet. However, the remote control unit I have is finicky for me. Sometimes it does not register that I pressed the button; sometimes it registers but does not initiate the cycle; sometimes it starts but stops itself and resets. Sometimes the settings I set last time, like for very warm water, unset themselves overnight, for no obvious reason... I don't know how to make the remote control act right consistently. But, since with the lockdown I basically have all the time in the world, I just keep messing with it, and eventually it does deliver.

I love love love the warm water wash feature. To me, it is an essential feature for appreciating the world of bidet. One time the remote control forgot that I set the water temperature for the warmest setting, and it delivered cold water instead -- oh no! I did not like that at all! A tensifying experience, versus a relaxing experience with the warm water.

I like the fan-dryer feature. It does not get me actually dry at all. But its two-minute cycle does remove a lot of wetness, so that less mopping off is needed at the end (I made myself a little stack of washable terrycloth towel rags for this purpose). Speaking of drying off, the overall bidet cycle ends with more than a few drops of water sprayed around the seat itself... kinda gross! So I mop that up too at the end. I'm not sure what that is about -- user error, or what.

But, ""bottom"" line, I am keeping it clean despite really running low on TP, with no prospects of getting more, and that is what I signed up for. So I am very very grateful and delighted with my purchase, and I highly recommend this product!!!"
"Overall the product works well but the controls are finicky which adds a level of annoyance to the use.
1) The night light randomly turns itself on. We have to turn it off multiple times per week
2) the buttons on the remote are very position and pressure sensitive. If you don't press in exactly the right spot with the right pressure for the right amount of time nothing will happen
3) There is a very short window of time when you can start the fan during the rinse process. Miss that windows and the fan will not activate. You cannot start the fan unless it is actively spraying water
4) the system will not retain the water temperature setting. It is always reverting back to no heat regardless of what we do. First thing we have to do when sitting done is adjust the water for that one use knowing it will reset back as soon as we stand up."
"Years ago I had frozen shoulder and could not move my wiping arm. Trying to use the other arm isn't easy. I bought the Brondell S300 from Home Depot and had a contractor install it by adding a power outlet. It was a life saver. Even though my arm was fine after 6 months, I got addicted to being so clean and a warm seat. When power went out during the night, the seat stays off until you press the power button. Sitting on a cold seat was a shock, but let me know I had a power outage. When the S300 broke, I had to have another one. The S300 had 2 plastic nozzles, one for front, one for back. I have very hard water and calcium/lime deposits are a problem. I sprayed vinegar on the nozzles and gently scrubbed them with an old toothbrush. Unfortunately the vinegar or my brushing caused the nozzles not to extend anymore so I bought this one. I was very happy with Brondell so I stuck with them. I am very happy with this purchase so far. It has one metal nozzle instead of 2 little plastic ones. The night light is pretty, but I didn't really need it. The seat and cover are better built and more comfortable than the S300. There are more selections on the remote for customization than the S300. I prefer the remote to the attached panel at the seat because I have issues with my neck. Turning and looking down at an attached panel is not easy for me plus I don't always have my glasses on. The installation was easy since the waterline and outlet were already in place. I love my new LE99, but I've only had it a week which is why I gave 4 stars instead of 5 because I don't know how long it will last. I'm hoping it will last as long or longer than my last one. The nozzle is louder when extending than the S300. I'm assuming a more powerful motor to extend a metal nozzle as opposed to plastic. Too me, its not really a con. Also the dryer is off to the side and not very powerful as others have stated. It doesn't bother me, I use TP to dry. I will add, with a bidet seat, you do not use as much TP. When the pandemic hit, I could not get TP because of the hoarders, but what paper I had lasted thanks to my S300. And yes I loved my S300. Sorry it broke. but I'm looking forward to my LE99. My first seat I purchased out of necessity. This one I purchased because I am addicted to bidet seats after having one. You gotta try it."
I have m.s and with that comes bowel issues. This device allows me to feel clean and comfortable.
"After an eye-opening conversation with friends, I realized that I was slow to the whole bidet thing. Was I the only one who did NOT have a bidet? It sure seemed that way. I never used one but my spouse had during travels. Yet my husband was adamantly opposed to the idea of it. Considering the benefits (for our own hygiene and the environment), I decided to move forward despite his reservations. We have one bathroom so we both needed to be on board. Based on a pal's research and recommendations, I decided to jump right in and get a decent model to start. If I was going to convince my hubby, I couldn't do it without basic perks like heated water...could I?

I also handled everything so as to make my case easier. I installed (super easy & straight-forward) & ordered small washcloths for patting dry. There was a slight learning period (3-5 times max) to personalize the settings for that Goldilocks experience. The remote is normal size but can be tricky because the writing is tiny and for a little bit, we inadvertently were changing settings mid-stream. But we figured it out and it's all good.

Using this was all the convincing my hubby needed.

We both are now (proudly) bidet snobs! The heated seat (which was something I didn't even care about) enhances the experience. Now that its winter, it's so appreciated during those visits. I realized I had become spoiled when I went to sit on a toilet that was NOT heated while away from home. I actually jumped up and looked back like something was wrong! We both laugh and admit that we time ourselves to make it home because we can't go back to a regular toilet.

My husband & I both agree that this product was a terrific purchase. It's worth it. The remote, the heated water, the heated seat, quiet close lid, all the options.... they make a difference and honestly, make
you feel pampered. Do you NEED all the add-ons? Probably not. Does it make you feel like royalty? Absolutely. If you can afford it, go for it."
"I have severe arthritis and still found it relatively easy to install. Please view the videos online and read the instructions before beginning to make it easier to install
it works well and you just need to read the instructions to understand the heat (water, seat, and drying air) settings. Water pressure and aiming are all done with the remote - it may take a while to learn the optimum settings, but then - Enjoy the Go!"
"Up until this week when we realized our seat was cracked and started pinching our posteriors we would have given Brondell 5 stars hands down. Unfortunately within the last week our seat cracked, we contacted Brondell promptly, but Brondell has yet to contact us in response. We do have a one year warranty on the product.

It is a nice warm toilet seat with a water feature that cleans front or back, has several adjustable positions and intensities. The spray is normally warm (unless your husband shuts it off while fumbling with it) although the remote is a bit difficult to program so we have never programmed it to our personalized preferences. Overall, I feel that this has been a great investment based on it lasting longer than 10 months. BTW neither of us even comes close to exceeding the 320lb seat weight limit.
So I hope that by posting this, Brondell reaches out to us and helps us resolve this issue, if not, our review will change to 1 star with massive sadness and disappointment.
Update: Brondell did reach out and followed through. Dye to our warranty being in place we got a new seat delivered free. Thank you Brondell for good customer service."
"All the features work perfectly, appearance very nice, fits easily as instructed lid nicely contoured, solid stability for a 200 pound person."
"Lets start with the gripes:
The remote has (hidden) buttons on the top. This may sound insignificant but being touch activated can be problematic. Guest users who are not familiar with the unit will accidentally press the user presets (which we don't use) on the top while handling the remote (mostly while putting the remote back in the holster). This can create a surprise for the next user when the seat isn't warm as we've come to expect :0 The manufacturer should consider relocating these buttons to the face of the remote.

The unit has a little trouble fitting on an old fashioned standard size toilet. It slides the seat (and you with it) forward on the bowl to accommodate the storage tank. This can create an issue fitting certain parts of you on the seat comfortably. It's takes a little getting used to. A small price to pay for what you get though. Maybe the manufacturer can consider changing the shape and/or location of the tank to aid in resolving this.

The dry function is useless. Think of the HIGH SPEED, HEATED hand dryers they use in public restrooms. This unit is neither. It would take an hour to successfully dry yourself with the low speed cold air blower that comes with it. A ""feature"" I paid for that should be removed to save cost.

The electrical cord could be a bit longer. Most bathrooms don't have receptacle within the range of the factory cord.

That's pretty much it for the negatives. Now for the positives.
I like the night light feature. Not too bright.
The heated seat is awesome. You really appreciate it when you're a guest elsewhere or when someone accidentally turns it off :0
The adjustability of the spray position and strength are adequate and get the job done.
The unit was easy to install and came with all the necessary hardware.
Overall a great product. I love it and can't figure out how I managed life in the past without it."
"Now that I have bidets in my home, I wouldn’t go without them. I miss them when I travel as I don’t have that “just washed” feeling anymore. I never use the blow dryer or seat heat on the bidet, but I do like the self cleaning and night light features. I like having a remote, but this one is so sensitive that I’m frequently unintentionally changing the mode setting and pressing other options near the sides of the remote. I’ve had the bidet 8 months, and I’m the only one using it (and it’s upstairs so it’s rarely used during day);However, I’ve already had to put in new batteries twice."
"My wife and I are in our mid 60's and our daughter recently urged us to add a bidet to our household. We reluctantly did so. Hard to change a 60 year old way of doing things! I realize I am rating this product only, having never used a bidet before. It has been a learning curve, but we are growing to like this addition to our household. I am DIYer and had to add an electrical outlet to our toilet room, to power the unit. Installation of the bidet was very simple and the instructions are user friendly. We seem to be using much less toilet paper (mainly for drying purposes) and it does make you feel cleaner. I'm sure as we continue to age and experience added physical disabilities, the bidet will be even more appreciated."
"Flaw 1:
The remote is not good. It's got ""user 1"" and ""user 2"" buttons on top, but heaven help you if you ever actually touch those; as far as I can tell they simply reset the thing to factory values, aka they turn off the heated water and heated seat and any eco mode you've picked. Maybe I'm missing something about getting it to save preferred settings?

But saved settings aside, sometimes the remote just stops responding at all. Lights still light up, but it just stops responding to any button presses. The only way to jolt it out of this is to pry the back off and remove and reinstall the batteries. This is super annoying, as the back of the remote isn't even all that easy to pry open.

Issue #2: the electronics in this thing are not great. Every time the seat heats, or the water heats, or the nozzle oscillates, this bidet causes LED lights throughout *my entire house* to flicker slightly. I could forgive it if it was just this one circuit. But nothing else I own has ever caused anything like this, including my Bunn coffee maker which also has a hot water reservoir it keeps heated at all times.

I've submitted these issues to the manufacturer as well, a few days ago. I will update my review whether I hear back or end up returning this."
"This product is by far the greatest investment for me!! I don't want to sound disgusting, butt, it takes care of disgusting things. I have bad hemorrhoids and had surgery last year. I find it very difficult to get thoroughly clean with toilet paper without making my butt sore and bleed, and I would use quite a bit of paper. I decided to get this bidet on recommendation of Consumer Reports. Amazon has many types of bidets, some more expensive with lots of gadgets, some cheaper with fewer gadgets. I chose the midsize sedan. It is the best thing since sliced potatoes! I LOVE it! It's easy to use with a lot of adjustment you can make to fit your butt needs. I've had it for three years with no problems at all, and I have very minerally rusty well water. the only complaints I have are the seat size; too narrow with a tilt inward, easily overcame the adjustment, and the dryer is too small to dry your butt. It takes too long to do a thorough job. So, I bought a package of cheap wash clothes to dry my butt instead of using the dryer or toilet paper. This also makes it eco friendly, fresh and clean. I hate using the toilet anywhere else but home.! On MY BRONDELL!!!"
"After purchasing and paying a handyman to install my bidet, we found the remote control did not work although the bidet works if you feel around on the side and find the correct button to push. I called Brondell and they sent a new remote for exchange and it still did not work. I called Brondell again and they said I had to return the bidet for repair. That meant spending another $80.00 to have the handyman to come remove it and another fee to reinstall it after the repair. I asked Brondell if they would just let me return it and send a new one and they said no, it was a return and repair situation only. It isn't worth the extra money and inconvenience to deal with this company to get this accomplished so I'm using it with no remote and not happy with it. I own three of these units and have had issues with two of them. I recommend a different brand,"
"works good. the electric is tricky as I had to hide it and run the cord into the sink stand and then up the wall to an outlet. but other than that, works well. warm water, fan, and heated seat. made of hard plastic though. the only thing missing is the baby powder....."
"My wife and I are happy with this purchase. Especially since we replaced our old Tushy bolt-on with this beautiful bidet.

It has a heated water tank, and hot water will last pretty well depending on water pressure options.

It has a blow dryer. It kinda dries you, but you will still need a slight mop up with tisdue when done.

It has a heated seat. Turn it on just prior to use, and it will work wonderfully. Remember to turn it off after each use or it will stay on.

It has a beautiful night lite. Great for late night use when half awake.

It has adjustable water heat and water pressure. I just crank it all up when I use it.

It has a Sitz bath option for those with hemorrhoid issues.

It has a strong mode, a gentle mode , and a pulse mode. They all work great.

My only issue is that the remote quit working and is dead as a rock.

I discussed this with Brondell customer service. They promised to send me a new one. So far, I have only had a request to return the old one, and no new one on the way. Disappointing.

We have only been able to use the basic buttons on the side of the bidet in the interim.

My request?....Get us our new remote ASAP and allow us to pitch the old one in the trash and get on with our lives. That would be phenomenal."
"Besides being a reliable bidet, this is a solidly built toilet seat, much better than ordinary ones. A person who does not want to use the bidet can use it as a conventional toilet seat, and nothing is in the way or the wrong size. We had a plumber install it because our house has old plumbing and we thought there was a risk of needing a new valve on the wall."
" The install was super easy. I had an outlet just close enough to plug in. It works great! I did need to purchase an inexpensive flex tube to replace the old rigid pipe from the water supply. It something that once you have one you will always have one. You won't go back to paper again. My septic tank just cost me $400 to pump out after every couple years and this device will prevent that maintenance in large part by reducing the paper and wet wipes that fill up the tank. Not using paper is a blessing to the environment as well. No more paper toilet plugging up on you.
Your butt will thank you!"
Works very well. I will never be without a Bidet Toilet seat again.
Sometimes the remote doesn’t work.
"Play Video
 Everything about this bidet is great! Heats up fast, remote is easy and has user settings, looks good too! But mine spits out a few ml of water every few minutes while not in use. Haven’t had it for long, but I’ve tried just about everything to remedy the issue but still it leaks. It’s not making a mess or anything, but it is a waste of water, and the noise is a bit annoying too. All that to say, I like the bidet, just wish mine didn’t leak…😕"
"The Brondell LE99 Swash Electronic Bidet Seat is a game-changer in our bathroom! It's so nice to have a warm and clean butt, not to mention the money-saving aspect by using less toilet paper. The Lite-Touch remote is convenient, and the warm air dryer is a luxurious feature. The strong wash mode and stainless-steel nozzle provide excellent cleaning. The saved user settings are a time-saver. Installation was a breeze, and it has transformed our bathroom experience. A solid 5-star review for this fantastic bidet seat!"
This seat doesn’t have some of the bells and whistles that some other brands do but that’s reflected in the price which is less than half of some other brands. Easy installation too.
"My wife and I love our new Brondell bidet toilet seat. Originally she just wanted a heated seat, but I figured that we should go all the way if we were going to go to the trouble and expense of installing a new electrical outlet in the bathroom next to the toilet.

My pre-purchase research pointed me to units that heated the water instantly instead of ones that operated with a small reservoir of heated water. The Brondell does that but requires only about 800 watts of power to accomplish the task. This compares favorably with other units I considered, some of which demanded 1500 watts, which would have maxed out the circuit I planned to tap into. And the Brondell heats the water just fine.

I had difficulty with water leakage out of the tee fitting that was included in the package, but a call to Brondell quickly resolved that issue. The company quickly sent me a replacement part that worked perfectly.

The drying feature of the Brondell works well enough, but it does not eliminate the need for toilet paper because we dab off a bit of the water before engaging the drier. Were we not to do that we would end up sitting for a long time waiting for our rumps to fully dry. The washer too does not do a thorough job without some manual assistance (I’ve traveled in Turkey, so I know the drill). The washer probably does as well as toilet paper, but I figure why not improve hygiene?"
"This product does the most important job of cleaning me well. I'm happy with the coverage, and water temperature. I'm figuring out the remote with the instructions, but it might be a little more intuitive. Installation wasn't difficult, but the tee connector should have a little more thread length where the supply line connects to the tee. My existing supply line bottomed out, and I had to use another supply line with a shorter compression nut, but that wasn't a big deal. I was dissapointed to find I received a product that had been returned previously. The parts were all there, but rolling around in the box. So far I'm happy."
"Go to the Brondell website <https://www.brondell.com/bidets/> to compare their various models before choosing. There you'll find much better descriptions. I'm replacing my 5 year old Swash 300. Though it was disappointing that it failed in 5 short years, I chose to replace it with another Brondell as I thought at least I wouldn't have to replace the mounting hardware... Not!

Here are the differences between my old 300 and this new one as I see them: The LE99 is thicker and more comfortable than my old 300. It makes my ""comfort height"" Toto Aquia darn near a bar stool! (I exaggerate). But for me, that's a good thing. Another positive is the ""Programmable User"" feature. Other differences I like are: Adjustable nozzle position, oscillating nozzle and ""ECO"" features. The only negative is the remote's buttons are flush, not like the raised blister buttons on the old 300's controller. Therefore I can't work them in the dark anymore. I carry a tiny flashlight at night rather that turn on the room light. The blue night light in the bowl is no help when you're sitting on it! And the blue light is apparently just that, a night light, albeit pretty cool looking. It's not, from what I've learned, an ultra-violet sanitizer; drat. Since blue light quenches ones night vision (more than would red light) as well as any melatonin, and I'd like to not wake up any more than necessary on my frequent night trips, I never turn it on. I don't use the seat warmer either, and I've found the air dryer to be way too slow to be useful. So I could have saved a few bucks had I taken my own advice and gone to the Brondell website first. But in the end, I'm pleased with my purchase and would recommend a Brondell to my friends. I strongly recommend a bidet for elderly or physically challenged folks like myself. Well, for anybody actually!"
"Have had this for a month now. Have not touched a square of toilet paper in that time. I am clean, always. I'm 71 and my skin has gotten sensitive including the skin down there. I would have times when I would have a burning sensation or itch no matter how clean I tried to be. For the last month I have had no issues like this. This toilet seat was easy to install, even for me. This toilet seat was easy to learn to use. I just played with the remote and figured out which settings were best for me. I don't know if other brands of bidet toilet seats are better than this one. I just know that this one works, is easy to use, and I am really pleased with my purchase. Only negative I have run into is that the aim of the sprayer is off. All the choices just hit me in the behind. This just means that I have to wiggle a bit to spray off all the areas needed. I can easily live with a little wiggle. In fact, I actually enjoy the wiggle knowing that I am clean. Those friends who have visited and actually given the seat a try have loved it and plan on getting one for themselves. Of course many of my friends just say ""EW"" and won't even give it a try. Too bad they are so close minded. They are missing out on a real pleasure. I actually feel regal using this product."
"I have a Toto toilet in my Mstr BR and am spoiled by it. I wanted a heated seat in my cold downstairs bathroom and decided on this. It took about 30 minutes to install, by a pro, but online instruction video looked simple enough. It showed how to measure yhe holes to end of the bowl to determine whether you need round or oval. I also needed a long extension cord because my outlet is on the other side of the room. Program the remote once and you're done. We mounted it on the wall above the toilet paper. The remote itself isn't exact, you have to touch just next to the icons, have to tell guests this if they use the water features. The nightlight is nice in the dark too."
"I've used Toto washlets at freind's houses, I own A SmartBidet (SB-1000). I'll be honest- performance wise, they're all about the same- similar feature sets, just enough hot water to get the job done, absolutely useless dryer feature. The remotest are relatively easy to negotiate... all variations on a theme.
Aesthetically, the Toto's are the sleekest, next comes the Brondell, the SmartBidet Looks like an appliance puked on your toilet.
The only other comment I'll make about the Brondell, is it whirrs and hums as it's doing its job. Short staccato noises that make it seem like it's being really busy, which it is, but it's weird.
OK I Lied, one more comment. The remote is fine overall, but the back is flimsy as all get out. It snapped/ cracked when I was prying it apart to install the 4(!) batteries in it- 4 batteries- everyone else uses 1 or 2..."
"* NOTE: YOU NEED TO MEASURE FROM THE TOILET TANK TO THE RIM OF THE TOILET TOO (see diagram from Brondell website for the ""D"" measurement). This measurement is missing in the Amazon product info, but IF YOUR ""D"" MEASUREMENT IS LESS THAN 20"" THE SEAT WILL EXTEND PAST THE EDGE OF THE TOILET. This means that the front rim of your toilet will actually be inside of the seat opening. The toilet opening is then smaller and male parts will be touching the toilet rim when sitting. This is a deal-breaker for us, so we're returning without having used it. I would have known it wouldn't fit if Amazon's information included that measurement like the Brondell website does. We were, however, impressed when playing the the remote and how easy it was to install (and uninstall) the bidet."
"All of a sudden, my bidet started to sound a single beep at random times of the day. It’s the same beep that occurs just before it performs a function, only it doesn’t do so when no one is seated on it. Problem is that this random beep is now waking me up at night. I could unplug it but I use the nightlight on the bidet at night. If I can get this issue fixed, I will improve the rating, but I cannot find anything online to explain or help resolve this issue. Can anyone help?"
$200+ for 3 months of service is a lousy deal! Buy another brand. I’ve purchased bidets for half the price and they worked for many years. This product is crap and is being returned.
"This bidet seat works just as well as the fancy Japanese brand I have in another bathroom. It looks good, not like it belongs in a nursing home, and gets you clean efficiently. The adjustable water pressure, water temperature, and nozzle position are features I would not want to be without. Some people love the heated seat, too. I would advise getting the model that doesn’t have the dryer function, because you’d be spending a LOT of time waiting for it to do the job that two squares of an absorbent toilet paper can do in seconds. It has a “nightlight“ feature, which illuminates the bowl with a blue light that is on always, that I find disconcerting; but it is easily disabled."
Simple install was great. Works really well. Only complaints are the time it takes the water to warm up and the way it rests on my toilet is a little off kilter. I’ve tried adjusting it but round toilets are a bit trickier than elongated.
"I was lucky enough to use this bidet when I rented a condo for eight months. It came with the place. I got spoiled. When it came time to move, I declared I was installing this bidet in my new place. Totally happy and I miss it when I'm not at home. Highly recommend."
"The product does everything it says in the description. I do enjoy most of it the downsizes the water pressure is really low even at the highest setting. No lighting on the control so when you sit down to use it (the night light it has) you lose lighting, needing to turn on the main lights to see control buttons. Even though my current porcelain seat is an oblong, the porcelain still sticks an inch inside the lid of the seat. For the female side it doesn’t come far enough forward, making them lean forward to get that area sprayed."
"If you're not sure which one to buy, buy this one. Prefer it over the more expensive toto. 2nd brondell we've owned and quality is just as good as it was 4 years ago."
"Works well. I like the adjustable nozzle position, adjustable strength of the water flow, seat is comfortable and the air dry feature is helpful. I didn’t think I would use the nightlight but I do like it! The weakest link in both Brondell Bidet units we have owned is the remote control. There is no consistency of operation when pressing a button to select an operation. The touch point seems to randomly move and often is difficult and frustrating to turn on and/or off. The remote for this Swash model we purchased and are currently using does not have lighted function buttons which makes it difficult to use in the dark, even with the night light turned on. I really like this bidet because it has many new and helpful features that our old model did not. I would give it 5 beautiful stars if it weren’t so difficult to use the remote."
I had a handy man install the bidet for me.He was already to hook up the water supply and the washer leaked that came with it. He had to go to Hone Depot for a new washer and come back to finish it. Cheap washer REALLY? AND LOOK AT THE PICTURE THIS BETTER WORK OK. I'LL LET YOU ALL KNOW IF IT DOES OR NOT!! Blue light supposedly kills germs which is nice if it's true.
Seller had great communication throughout delivery the install was easy and instructions were straight forward. The water does take a minute to warm up but once it does it is a great washing experience!
"I have had a much cheaper and more simplistic Brondell bidet seat for years (that just connected to both hot and cold water lines and had a manual valve to turn on). From the time I purchased it, I absolutely loved it.

I was moving to a new home, and decided that as pleased as I'd been with what I had, there were a few shortcomings. I decided to upgrade to the LE99, and am thrilled so far.

Installation was easy, though the instructions not outstanding. I won't lie, there were two rubber washers in the package that I couldn't find anywhere in the instructions. I don't have leaks the in the water lines, so I'm hoping that I don't run into trouble down the road.

The heated seat is a nice feature, and can be very subtle on the low setting. Just enough to take off any chill.

It definitely does it's job, and can be adjusted well for position, pressure, and water temperature. There are times that it seems not to hold the water temperature for as long as other times, and I really haven't figured out why. However, even the times that it seems to cool a little are not a big deal as the temperature is more than comfortable.

As others have mentioned, the dryer is weaker than what you'd need to be all that dry. But, since I was upgrading from a model that had no drier at all, I suppose my standards are fairly low on that end, so I'm satisfied enough.

I'm nervous about all the electronics and the motorized nozzle on this, since my former seat was so simplistic. I hope it's built to last with all those bells and whistles.

Thus far, very satisfied with the purchase."
"My first thoughts... I am just greatful to have it installed after a week of constipation. My first bidet brondell stop working after 7 years. It drying was joke and only good to stink up the room.... So happy to get cheaper version with out the fan. Yet I will miss the wide spray option. Found the option sitting of sit bath option spray for 5 min setting to be nice surprise and nice for the constipation help.

Such bad time to brake... bidet is nice way to cool off in the summer time.... with cold water down below. Other times of the year ya heat seat and water is nice...
I do find this blue light a little strange... a feeling as if there crime scene being investigated."
"We installed our swash LT99 about two weeks ago and it took a few days to get used to it. The LT99 does everything it says it will do. Love the heated seat, the blue light, and the warm water. This was our very first experience with a bidet and I had read that the average person uses about $250 a year in toilet paper. Well, in 6 months, my bidet will begin to put that $250 a year back into my pocket. The toilet paper shortage will not be my problem any more. There are many bidets out there so I chose one that would not kill the bank incase we did not like it and I wanted it to be made in the USA. The remote is a lite touch remote, easy to understand and works great. Installation was easy, just watch the video on the website. I knew I had to have warm water in order to sell the idea to my wife so this is the model that I chose. She was resistant at first, but the warm seat and warm water melted away any resistance. All in all, we took a gamble and I am very please with the results....in fact, we love our bidet and will never go back. David"
"This is my 4th bidet I've owned in my life. I've been using it for a year now, and I've never had a more broken and error prone piece of technology in my life. It's the Windows ME of bidets.

The multi user function is useless. (It works, there's just no reason to use it)

The remote has very little range, and started glitching 4 months in. Now, one year later and it barely functions at all.

The lid broke completely.

After about a month, the motor on it became quite loud. Now the neighbors know when I'm about to wipe.

The range of the adjustments is so narrow they're barely worth adjusting.

The heated seat and water functions worked great.

The angle of the seat is too extreme and works poorly with a squat stool.

It's impossible to clean in visible areas around the hinge without literally removing it.

I will be going back to the $50 options as they are actually more luxurious to use than this. And they look better too."
"Impressive features. Has everything I need for a bidet, front/rear wash, heated seats, customizable everything, even water temperature . Drier has gentle warm air which is I think by design is good because I really don’t want microbes blown around the air so I rarely use it bit it’s there if wanted. I love it so far. Quality seems good and should withstand years of normal use."
It's nice. It's big too. Unfortunately I need to send ours back. The back hits the back of our toilet but we have an old style. Very old. A normal toilet won't have this problem. Also I haven't figured out how to turn the seat heater off. It's been on for 2 days. Otherwise it's real nice.
Ordered this for an older family member due to an injury. She doesn't like trying new things so I'm surprised she's adapted to it. The heater is weak. The remote works intermittently. It was easy to install.
"this was chosen based on amazon reviews and affordability on my part. installation was extremely easy (even though it was done by a former plumber, not me). The seat doesn't raise upon entry but I am ok with that. I only have 2 minor issues. For front wash, I don't feel the nozzle extends as far as it should while at the same time it makes sense so that water isn't shooting up through your legs spraying your bathroom walls/shower curtain. I simply adjust my sitting position so that it reaches. My toilet already sits high so this seat does add to the height a little. (And I'm only 5""3'.) I have to hit the dryer a 2nd time bc I am not dry after the 2minute cycle. Overall, after having it installed for a week I am satisfied with my purchase."
"Not sure if this crack was there before i installed and used it...with. soft closed lid, there is no way anyone could have slammed it that hard. I weigh 160lb, other peeps way less than me. And its only been a few months. Otherwise i enjoy the operation of this seat."
after installation we find there is a link on the connect. the plum guy said the installation parts is bad and need replacement new one . so i need you mail me installation parts ASAP. otherwise I will make returning.
"This came with plastic bolts which broke as soon as my husband lifted the seat to pee. We replaced the plastic bolts with brass. Installation was easy once we got past the plastic bolt issue.

The remote control is impossible to use in the dark unless you turn on a light to see the buttons. It should either be lighted or have raised buttons.

I went on the Blondell site after I bought the bidet to buy an extended warranty---3 years parts and labor instead of 1 year for $59.00.

It works as expected, although the water is not as warm as I'd hoped. All in all, I'm happy with the purchase."
"4.5 stars I wasn't sure what to expect and I'm curious if the bidet seats that are 2-3 times the cost are worth it. It was easy to install. Love, love, love the heated seat. The front and rear water nozzles work well. The warm water doesn't last very long and that has been the only disappointment. The air dryer is worthless. Love the remote control and functions."
"water temp does not stay as set. sometimes it is really COLD. sometimes it is warm, no matter what the color is.
unless i sit very far back, the water does not reach far enough forward.
the warm air dry (not always warm) does not really dry unless you have 5 or 10 min.
the lid was scuffed.
these are things i can tolerate but will buy a different brand next time."
"This is our first bidet and it's been an interesting experience. It took a while to gain confidence in the final result, but after a month or so we got more confident in its use. It works best if you move around while it sprays... you don't have to move a lot, just a little here and there. The overall system works well but the remote control has buttons on the top and side which I accidentally activate from time to time... thank goodness it doesn't start immediately, so I have a second or two to hit cancel. So, the remote control could be designed much better, but when I'm careful with it, it does everything you need once you learn how to use it. (Read the manual and practice a lot! Ha!) Overall, I'd have to say it's been a positive experience, I'm glad we have one, and I can recommend this one."
"I have had this bidet for about a year now. After about six months, I was doing my business one day and I heard a crack. When I got up there was no visible damage so I just forgot about it. A few days later I was sitting there and the cheap think plastic that makes up the seat shifted like the San Andreas Fault and sliced my left ass cheap right open! Now at the time of this review (9/23) there is no weight limit posted on the posting for this seat. I am a 310 pound man. I’m not little by any means but damn…it’s not like I’m standing on the seat. The bidet part works great but the seat will cut ya! Waste of $300 unfortunately."
" Awesome product! It won’t eliminate wipes for me, but I have no more need for TP. If you’re not used to using these, then I’d suggest you start gentle then work your way up with the pressure. Otherwise you will jump off the toilet…from what I’ve heard at least👀. I didn’t do that of course! All in all I love it!"
"So, easy to install and works great. Love the warm seat. The only cons are that it takes about 15 seconds from when you press the button to when the water comes out. A mild annoyance and it makes all these ""gear shifting"" type sounds before it starts the water. I have gotten in the habit of pressing it as soon as I sit down so the water starts as soon as I'm done. The water temperature is good at the beginning of a wash, but if you go for a longer wash, it cools down. Still not cold, but not warm either. I bought another brand that was on sale at Costco recently for my other bathroom (Bio Bidet USPA 6800) and I like that one better. The cons mentioned above don't exist with that one. But, both are an upgrade to what I had before, so I'm mostly satisfied with this one."
"So we’ve had this over a month and the first bidet we’ve ever had. Bought it to decrease on TP use, but also the cleansing aspect. Really, really like it. Only suggestions are to not waste money on the drying option ( as mentioned by a previous reviewer). It doesn’t really dry well, so save a few bucks. Also wish the remote lit up at night so you don’t have to turn on the lights to use it at night.
Update. It’s been over 6 months since we’ve started using this bidet. I like it more and more every day and recommend it to anyone who’ll listen. Do not hesitate to invest in this. BTW, I’ve been looking at moving and the first thing I look at when it comes to bathrooms is does it have an electrical outlet close to the toilet."
"Hardest part of this install was determining how to power it. Luckily for me I could pull power from an outlet on the opposite side of the wall. So I added a new outlet and tapped into the one on the other side of the wall.

The pressure is great, at max it is strong but not too strong.
I find it easy to zero in on the proper settings for maximum effectiveness.
The heated seat and water in a joy. currently I use the low settings in eco mode.
The fan is nice but could probably use a power booster above the current max setting.
I like the blue night vision it give the whole toilet/bidet a modern feel while being practical.
The size/mass of the bidet is immense and will take some getting used to. It give the toilet a larger presence in the room.
The remote is modern, sleek and easy to use. I choose to power with 8 rechargeable batteries to cut down on waste and make sure I always had a working remote, using 4 at a time with 4 in reserve to swap out.

Over all I am happy with this product! I would buy again for my second bathroom once I remodel it and add power."
Love this product and I will buy more. I actually had a problem with the product and customer service was excellemnt. They sent me a lable to send it in for repair and I had the product back and working properly in less than 10 days.
"I'm a 69 year old male and up to this time had never experienced a bidet so the initial maiden voyage was a 'woohoo, ahhh' moment. First let me address the quality of the model Swash LT99 I purchased. I have a very strong mechanical back ground along with years of experience in most of the construction trades. This being said, not to boast on my behalf, the ease of installation, the straight forward directions and available videos were spot on so that any one should be able to install this unit with minimal challenges. From the comfort of the toilet seat, to all necessary included plumbing fixtures and once you set up the multiple personal usage options on the remote control you're good to go (pun intended).
The Swash LT99 is of a quality not often found these days and from my experience thus far, every facet of the Swash LT99 is very positive; the sanitary advantage is so much more compared to t-paper and wipes. I did use t-paper after using the first couple of times to check cleanliness and absolutely nothing showed up on paper.
If there is such a thing as a silver lining to the current global Coronavirus Pandemic it is this hidden blessing because otherwise I would not have been in the market for a bidet.
Thank you Brondell for a great product!"
"This product is life changing. I would recommend to anyone!

There are only a few minor inconveniences:
- the item is about 1/4"" too long for my toilet, despite the company saying that it is fully adjustable to a toilet of my dimensions.
- the hot water heater works great, but does take a fraction of a second to start working. this means the first blast of water is always cold.
-the ""easy touch"" remote sometimes takes multiple button presses to respond appropriately.
- Some of the remote functions require convoluted button presses and holds (example: saving user settings or turning of the nightlight)

Although irritating, these inconveniences are so minor compared to the benefits of this product! Everything else works wonderfully and as advertised! Brondell has great customer service; I would gladly recommend this product and try any other Brondell product!"
"Within the first week, I kept having problems with the remote, where I had to press multiple times for it to work. The heated seat doesn’t stay warm and turns cold. I contacted Brondell customer support and they had me change the batteries, but that wasn't the problem. They claimed my case is the first they've ever heard of and sent me a new remote.
I kept having the same problem even with the new remote, thus it wasn't the remote. Their customer support's not that responsive and I've been ignored multiple times.
I asked for a replacement, but they want me to ship the unit to them for possible repair. I just don't have the trust and refuse to play their games. I will return this inferior product."
"My GI and General Surgeon both strongly suggested that I try this bidet, specifically for it's features. I have been using it and can say that it has kept me from having to have a pretty horrible ileostomy surgery and a lifetime of crap.

The warm seat feature is nice to have late at night ofcourse along with the blue seat light that definitely helps you see in the dark. I love the ability to change nozzle positions on the fly and water temps as well. There is a deductible women's setting ofcourse with the forward nozzle that sprays from a slightly more forward to rear angle and with lighter pressure. Finally my favorite thing is being able to change the water pressure. I know I missed a lot but this bidet is worth every dollar, plain and simple!"
"We had a Bronson for almost 10 years, and we tried a different brand when it needed replacing but it was awful. Went back to the Bronson. Works great, but the remote is awful. Unlike the remote to the previous Bronson, the buttons are flush so you have to look at it to be sure you are on the right button. Because the buttons have light printing,, they are also difficult to read for those of us that can't see them without reading glasses. It's easy to accidentally graze the wrong button and change the settings. It's large and cumbersome. The Bidet would have a 5 star review if it weren't for the darn remote."
"I have wanted to purchase a bidet seat for a couple years. I'm glad that I choose the Brondell Swash LT99. It really is everything that they say it is. I choose not to get the model with the dryer based on other reviews and I don't miss it. First, it really is easy to install. It took me 15 minutes including time in removing the old seat and thoroughly cleaning the toilet prior to installation. Once plugging in it was ready to go. The remote controls are very intuitive and easy to use. The water spray was the perfect temperature without adjusting and the position adjustment was simple. Most importantly, it leaves you feeling clean in a way that toilet paper just does not. I'm just sorry I didn't take the jump sooner."
"I bought this washlet when TP was nearly impossible to find. (My teenage son uses a lot of TP at times.)

The only reason you might not want this washlet is if the short seat won't work for you. We have a standard toilet and the seat on this is about 4"" shorter. I have a significant posterior. If it were even larger, I'm not sure this would work for me.

But we don't have a hot water inlet near the toilet and we do have an outlet just around the corner, so this one was the right one for us. It heats the water, warms the seat, and has the ability to save 2 custom programs on the remote.

Installation took maybe 15 minutes (after it took me a full 30 minutes to crank the rusty bolts off the old toilet seat!). Set everything up, put a tissue under the valve, checked 5 mins later, no leaks. Easy peasy.

Lots of customizations possible--nozzle position, water temp, flow strength. Pretty primo. And nice to support an SF Bay Area company!"
"I'm writing this review in hopes it helps someone out there. I love bidets! I loved the Brondell brand until I got my new Brondell LE99! I told myself go ahead and spend the extra on the air dryer! Why did I do that when my last Brondell did not have it and it was perfect! My old Brondell was quiet, fast response with the click of the remote and the water and seat warmer was perfect. But I decided to upgrade and now I'm stuck with this noisy bidet that sometimes has a warm seat and warm water and sometimes does not! It makes all kinds of clicking noisy sounds and takes it's time to start the water and has an unusable fan!!!"
"UPDATE: New one has been working great for a while now. The blue light could be dialed down a few notches and remote needs backlight. Fingers crossed it lasts years!

Purchased LE99 after much research and loved it…. At first. Stopped warming water and seat after only 3 weeks. Waiting on replacement from Amazon (thank goodness) and hoping new one lasts much longer. Time will tell."
"We bought this because we finally have an outlet close enough to a toilet to use an electric bidet. It's great! It was easy to install, it's easy to use, and is a treat.

It's 4 stars because the seat opening isn't quite as big as an elongated bowl; it's about an inch or two smaller. And as everyone knows, when it comes to toilet openings every inch counts. I also wish there was a way for the nightlight to be scheduled.

That said, we really like it. The warm water is very pleasant, and the heated seat is a treat. I'm looking forward to buying more of these for the other bathrooms."
"Ok. I will start out saying I was skeptical at first, a little nervous for the water works. Never used anything like it. After my first ride, all I can say is what took so long! Seriously.
The remote control is great for adjustments to flow, temp, position etc. I like being able to see what I'm doing. A touch pad on the side is less than ideal. The remote is also smooth and easy to clean and sanitize as needed. the user programming is nice because not everyone is the same size. Adjustable temps are crucial. Love spicy food? A cool blast where it counts is a game changer. Install was very easy. (Hardest part was the outlet near by but that's a me problem, not a you problem) quality, fit and finish is good. Seems well built.

Worth every penny. Seriously don't wait, you need this."
"This is not as good as the swash 1400 and does not have all the bells and whistles however it is great as a budget bidet at half or less than half the price, with all the basic bells and whistles. Most importantly nozzle control, water pressure control, water temperature control, backlight, remote, seat warmer. Drying fan is much weaker even with the temperature all the way up. Single nozzle instead of dual nozzle. And no deodorizer. I still would recommend the 1400 to those who wish to reach for more independence with a cleaner wash, dry, and sanitation."
"I purchased this expensive Brondell LE99 in Oct. 2021. The remote and its functionality does not work in 20 months (less than 2 years) of its use.

Emailed to customer support, who followed normal routines, but still was not able to make it function again. Since it was expensive, I could not thrash it easily. They want me to pay more to get a replacement.. I also complainded to them that the seat has started cracking on the right side when sitting on it and it pinches my flesh at the back of the upper thigh (below buttocks) when I'm using it. This is very risk and a very fundamental quality flaw of the material used for the seat - It should not have ever happened.

Please be aware of this risky experience for your use. I'm very upset with this and confirming again that such low quality materials for the item is not sustainable at any part of its lifetime..."
" Easy to install. Works as expected.
Overall quite satisfied with the product."
Very nice
Have a Kohler in our master bathroom. Purchased this unit and it works extremely well. We are very pleased with it
"Toilet paper shortage. . . I do not care.
Toilet Paper prices climbing. . . I do not care

Everything about this I like. EXCEPT, the dryer is all but useless. You really could save yourself a few dollars and get one without the dryer.

It is a different feeling, but not a bad feeling. Has all the features of the high end models at a mid range price.

We have a septic tank. So I like that toilet paper use has declined.

Wife really likes the heated seat."
"I find that I usually have to use toilet paper after washing, either because the dryer doesn't do a very good job or the spray doesn't clean very well. The dry has a flap that closes when not in use and lifts from the bottom when blowing. This tend to direct the air flow into the bowl and not the anus.

At times the buttons on the remote are not very responsive. One time it took me 3 tries to end the a wash."
This is an excellent unit it’s a game changer you will never want to go to the bathroom anywhere else but home again. You won’t find much online about it because it’s brand new to market and Amazon is the only places that sells it (confirmed by Brondell via telephone). I had a little bit of trouble with delivery it was supposed to be here Friday “PRIME” but then they sent me a message saying it wouldn’t be here til Monday so I wrote a message back to the right people and it came the next day Saturday. It took all of 10 minutes to install and it does an amazing job. If there is one knock against it it’s the fact that there has to be a certain weight limit before it’ll work my daughter got on it and it wouldn’t do anything she’s about 40-45 pounds so I’ll still have to buy toilet paper but other then that it’s great. I’m not going to hold the delivery against the unit but I do ask that if the unit should work on a 45 pound person that someone let me know. Thanks.
"This is our second unit. We've seen this type of product at a friends and we started doing research. We came across Brondell and everything we saw was good. We bought our first unit to test it out and see for ourselves. 30 days later I'm installing our second unit. Easy to install, takes maybe 30 min and that is figuring where to put the remote. Now, you need power by the toilet, so if you don't have an outlet close you'll need to add one. Our first one was easy since there was an outlet on the other side of the wall. The second one we had to have an outlet added. All worth it though, value for the money."
"Purchase process is very cloudy. It turns out that this profile (elongated) is also offered with warm air dryer. Reading the description of the LT99 omits any reference to existence of warm air dryer in other models. A great disappointment. It was not until after installation by a professional plumber/handiman (do not believe that this is a simple task!) did I notice that this model did not have a warm air dryer. Yikes. Out the funds for installation on TWO (one for each toilet)! Sadly, having owned an earlier/older model which we had in HI & which had the warm air dryer...I did not even think the two we just purchased and installed would be offered without this feature. Oh well, we'll still have to rely on TP for the final dabs."
I have purchased this product before so I was very disappointed when this bidet arrived and I encountered problems. The seat was cracked on the underside. The water was not very warm. The remote control was not responsive. Delayed action.
"I bought a Toto G400 years ago and wanted to add another bidet to the upstairs john and this was priced right in comparison. It has all the same features, pretty much. The spray is WAY stronger on the Brondell compared to Toto so expect that on first use. It definitely blasts your derriere.

The hot water tank is quite a bit smaller than the Toto so you'll run out of hot water sooner, but you don't need that long of a spray with this thing.

For the price, this is a great unit but it is not nearly as refined as Toto. I would still buy it again."
"Even if the pandemic is over, I'm thankful it introduced me to this bidet. I will never go back to a standard wipe if I can avoid it. This bidet provides every comfort you could possibly want, including the standard customizations (temperature, angle, duration) and then some. I have not seen any other bidet that uses an oscillating, adjustable heated nozzle that can even work as an enema. This is THE bidet, the perfect bidet, for most people. This was my 4th bidet and my last. I compared this to Lux, Tushy, and Toto directly, and returned all of them except this one. This is it..there isn't anything better for the money, and there really aren't any additional features you could ask for. It's PERFECT."
"It’s a very good bidet for the price. So far working well. Has most of the features. I had Bio Bidet before. It was leaking and had other problems also. This one has most of the features that Bio Bedet had except dryer. I didn’t use the dryer anyway, because it took too long and still didn’t do a good job. This bidet some more features like memory settings. Adjustable nozzle position and adjustable water force. 👍. Hope it works well for long period!"
"This item replaces a 12 years old bidet seat which was leaking from the water reservoir. I chose a more basic model Swash LT99 just to serve my needs. This unit does not come with a dryer which I specifically do not need. It is easy to install except it was not clearly marked which side of the mounting plate up. The remote needed some figuring out to get the right setting. There is momentarily pause before the nozzle extends out with a little bit of accompanying noise. All in all, it is a well built unit and I hope it will last for years. BTW, I did turn off the nightlight which is a bit gimmicky."
"My daughter installed the Brondell in no time flat. It’s everything I had hoped for in a bidet. The only niggle I have is that the remote could be backlit for nighttime trips to the bathroom. If you don’t need to turn an overhead light on, you can certainly find the seat and yet the remote remains dark. Mind you, I haven’t read the user manual yet, so perhaps that’s an option?
The bidet controls are smooth and easily adaptable, and I am very happy I spent the money on a quality product."
"I purchased this bidet as a gift for my 95 year old mom, who lives with me. She LOVES it! She enjoys the heated seat, the heated water, and how clean she feels after using it. I was able to mount the remote on the wall just next to it, so it’s very easy for her to get to. She’s able to easily see and push the buttons. Due to her age. I was concerned about urinary tract infections and overall cleanliness. Her having this bidet clears me of those concerns. I promise I’m not exaggerating when I say that she thanks me for it nearly every day.

The bidet was very easy to install (watched a video on line) and took under 30 minutes from start to finish.

I really can’t think of one negative thing to say about it.

PS... I love having it here, too 😉"
"I've purchased both the Brondell Swash 1000 and the AMDM Intelliseat offered here on Amazon but also from Costco:

AMDM IntelliSeat - The Ultimate Bidet Electronic Toilet Seat w/ Remote ISB200 - Washlet White

The Swash 1000 and the Intelliseat have similar features, except the Swash has a few more. However, the Swash 1000 costs three times as much as the Intelliseat. Here's a brief comparison between the two bidet seats based on my experiences. Please bear with me as the review is very lengthy, but I hope it'll help you make an informed decision if you're stuck between the Swash and the Intelliseat.

Installation: The installation process was very similar between the Swash and the Intelliseat, and shouldn't take more than 30 minutes. Both use a T-valve hooked onto your toilet's water supply to feed water into the bidet, but there are differences. The Swash's T-valve is a 7/8"" connection that fits between the fill valve connection under your toilet tank and the water supply hose. This greatly eliminates the probability of needing additional adapters because fill valves connections are almost always 7/8"", and you simply hook up the water supply hose to the T-valve, and the T-valve over the fill valve connection. The Intelliseat's T-valve fits between the water supply hose and the water supply valve from your wall. The Intelliseat's T-valve is made to fit over 3/8"" or 1/2"" if you use the included conversion nut, but I ended up having to shop for another conversion nut because the one that came with the seat didn't fit. Also, the Intelliseat's T-valve bottlenecks the water going to my toilet, so now the toilet fills a little more slowly. Not that big of a deal, but Swash's connection is well thought-out and much less of a hassle. Winner: Swash 1000

Nozzles: Both have two nozzles, one for back wash (for your butt) and one for front wash (for your lady parts). However, the Intelliseat has one plastic wand with both nozzles, while the Swash has separate stainless steel wands for each nozzle. Stainless steel is generally accepted as being more hygienic and resistant to bacteria than plastic, and the separate wand for front and back wash also seems more hygienic. Winner: Swash 1000

Nozzle cleaning: The nozzles on both seats have a self-cleaning rinse before and after each wash cycle, and you can also run the self-cleaning rinse manually. However, the Swash boasts a ""silver oxide nanoparticle treatment"" when you hit the ""Sterilization"" button on the remote. I'm not really sure how it works or what it does because it just looks like a self-cleaning rinse when I activate it, but I do know that silver oxide has antibacterial properties, so that's comforting. Winner: Swash 1000

Adjustable spray strength and position: Both seats have adjustable spray strength and position. The Swash's spray covers a wider area, is aerated, and the spray width can be also be adjusted. It feels like a showerhead spray. The Intelliseat has a more concentrated and powerful single stream, but the spray width cannot be adjusted. The Intelliseat is also capable of probably giving you an enema on its strongest setting, and in general I find that the Intelliseat sprays much stronger than it needs to. Winner: Swash 1000

Sweeping spray function: Both seats have a mode that sweeps the spray back and forth to cover more area, except on the Swash, it's called ""Move"", and on the Intelliseat, it's called ""Oscillate"". Both work about the same. Tie: Swash 1000, Intelliseat

Adjustable water temperature: Both have adjustable water temperature. The Swash 1000 has a tankless ceramic on-demand heater, which means the Swash won't run out of heated water, and you won't have to wait for the water to be heated. The Intelliseat has a heated reservoir system, so it is possible to run out if the seat is being used a lot, and it'll use up power to keep the reservoir warm. I'm fine with the room temperature setting here in Southern California, but some people like warmer sprays. Winner: Swash 1000

Heated seat: Again, being in SoCal, I don't really need a warmed seat, but the option is nice and both the Swash and the Intelliseat can either keep the toilet seat warm at all times, or warm it up as soon as it detects someone's butt on the seat. Tie: Swash 1000 & Intelliseat

Slow-closing seat and lid: Both models perform pretty well, with extremely silent closing. However, when the seat and lid are closed, you can sit on the Swash's lid, but you can't on the Intelliseat's. Not a big deal for me, since I don't sit on my toilet unless I need to poop, but the option is there. Winner: Swash 1000

Heated air dryer: Both seats have a heat-adjustable air dryer, and they're more or less the same on both seats. You'll still need a few squares of toilet paper to pat dry, so it won't completely dry your butt for you. Tie: Swash 1000 & Intelliseat

Remote: Both have battery-operated remotes. The Swash uses two AAAs, the Intelliseat uses three AAAs. I've read that the Intelliseat chews through batteries really quickly, but the Intelliseat has a more informative remote. Both seats have LED indicators for seat temperature and water temperature, but only the Intelliseat has spray strength and position indicators. It's a tough call, but the Intelliseat's remote seems more useful, even though you'll have to change out the batteries more often. Winner: Intelliseat

Deodorizer: The Swash sucks up air from the bowl and passes it through some carbon filters. It actually works pretty well at keeping poopy smells at bay, as long as you remember to hit the deodorize button on the remote when you're sitting on the toilet making poopy smells. The Intelliseat has no such feature. Winner: Swash 1000

Appearance: The Swash is 15"" wide, 20.8"" long, and 5.66"" high. The Intelliseat is 19.4""wide, 20.6"" long, 7.28"" and high. Both are pretty bulky add-ons to a toilet, but at least the Swash is a little more compact and sleeker. Winner: Swash 1000

Price: This will probably be the deciding factor for most people. The Swash 1000 currently retails for $600 here on Amazon and at most places on the web, and the Intelliseat retails for $200 at Costco (though I got mine for $150 because of a promotion at the time) and $240 here on Amazon. Costco also has an amazing lifetime return policy. The Brondell only has a three-year limited manufacturer's warranty, and costs at least three times as much as the Intelliseat. Winner: Intelliseat

Overall, the Swash 1000 wins out over the Intelliseat in terms of features, but if you're on the fence about getting a bidet, I would recommend you go to Costco and get an Intelliseat. The Intelliseat is only 1/3 of the Swash 1000's price, and Costco backs you with a lifetime return policy in case you don't like it or if it breaks. If you have a little more to spend and want more features, go with the Swash 1000. But in any case, getting either seat will bring you to a whole new level of post-poop freshness and hygiene.

UPDATE 6/02/2014: After using both units for a good amount of time, I wholeheartedly recommend the Swash over the Intelliseat if your budget permits. The Swash 1000's spray is much more comfortable, and I've been having inconsistent spray strength issues on the Intelliseat, though I haven't had a chance to see if there is sediment somewhere in the Intelliseat's water connections. In addition, the slow-close seat on the Intelliseat doesn't close as slowly anymore, but it doesn't quite slam the toilet yet. One more important addition is that Costco.com currently offers the Swash 1000, which means you can get the Swash AND be backed by Costco's return policy."
"I would highly recommend the Brondell S1000 Bidet and would purchase one again. The wireless remote makes it easy to control the operation and is quite straight forward. I think other styles that have the side mount controls would be awkward to read and use. I recommend this model with the wireless remote, air dry, front and rear and deodorize. It has a heated seat function which I don't use.

The seat is comfortable and cleans you well. Cleans front or rear, adjustable water temperature, adjustable spray pressure, oscillating nozzle if you want, user controllable nozzle position, and air dry. The nozzle is not in view while doing your duty. The nozzle extends out when you press the front or rear button and then sprays. The nozzle does a self cleaning before and after. There is a sanitize button that cleans the nozzle even more if you desire. I don't know the technology behind that.

Another interesting feature for my stinky friends (I don't stink) is the deodorize button. When the deodorize button is pressed, a suction fan begins drawing room air into the toilet and drawing the odor through a charcoal filter. How about that.

All functions can be stopped anytime with the red stop button. Otherwise, the functions stay on for 2 minutes then shut off. You can always press the function buttons again (Front, Rear, Air Dry) for two more minutes and shut off manually if you desire.

Even after the air dry, I like to take a small amount of Toilet paper to pat dry and look to reassure myself I'm actually clean. I am and it's great.

Installation can be done by the user. I did get confused on installing the supplied ""T"" into the toilet supply line to get water for the Bidet. I perceived the photo in the instructions having the T installed at the supply shut off valve. I would have had to purchase some adaptors to make that work. I mounted the T directly to the toilet tank nipple sticking out of the bottom of the tank and then ran the supply line down to the shut off valve. I didn't need any other adaptors."
"I bought this seat in 2015 due to all of the 5 star reviews. Amazon did a fast and perfect installation as promised. The bidet worked perfectly for about 1 year. After that, the remote stopped working and most of the features are only accessible by remote. The toilet also leaks a lot. A little over two years later it also has cracks in the seat. The durability of this product is horrible. I tried to get some assistance from the company to repair or replace it. I would have to uninstall it and send it in for them to do so. To their credit, they offered to help with the return process after this review. Even though the company followed up on inquiries and my dissatisfied purchase, I would not buy this product again. I don't think a bidet that costs $600 should break down in 1 year. I should not need to send it in for repairs/replacement. I would look for a bidet with more durability and better company customer service. The Brondell limited warranty covers 100% the 1st year, 75% of labor and parts the 2nd year, and only 50% of labor and parts the 3rd year. We opted to buy a new bidet with a better warranty. We purchased the Bio Bidet BB-2000. This bidet has a 3 year 100% warranty and the option to purchase an additional 3 years for a total of 6 years warranty at 100% labor and parts!"
"I know… who wants to talk about bathroom procedures in public? Well, there’s nothing embarrassing about excellent hygiene and personal comfort, and, in fact, there are people around the world who wonder that Americans don’t have bidets installed as a rule. They are helpful for the obvious reasons, and also for people with physical challenges.

The old adage, “you get what you pay for” hasn’t gone out of style because it is frequently true. Cheaper versions of certain consumer items may work well enough, especially when we need to save some money, but in some cases, getting the item from a tried and true manufacturer is the best choice. I highly recommend Brondell because that is pretty much all they do—make bidet seats in different price ranges with different features. Having owned other (cheaper) brands, I can say without hesitation that Brondell’s Swash 1000 is excellent. I did extensive research on several brands and models before buying.

Yes, the Swash 1000 is expensive, though it is currently on sale ($479 rather than $599), and worth every penny. There are, by the way, some considerably more expensive ones on the market, so the price isn't outrageous for what you get. Brondell also makes less expensive models. The 1000, unlike almost all other types, comes with a 3-year warranty. It also features stainless steel nozzles with self-cleaning and sanitizing functions, a heated seat, adjustable water temp and several customizable settings for personal preference. The remote control has a bracket that can be attached in some convenient nearby location.

Installation is not difficult as long as you have a screwdriver, an open adjustable wrench or other suitable tool for loosening couplings, and the ability and wisdom to follow very clearly written and illustrated instructions. The 1000 comes with all the parts you will need unless you happen to have a rigid pipe connection between the water supply and the toilet in which case you MAY need to purchase a flexible water line. Otherwise, all the hardware, washers, etc. are in the box. Another advantage of this unit is its degree of adjustability in terms of placement. A cleverly designed bracket system that attaches directly to the toilet can be moved forward or backward to accommodate different bowl lengths. The entire unit can be easily and quickly removed (pressing one release button) from the brackets to allow for cleaning.

If this is something you are seeking, and the price fits your budget, then you won’t be disappointed. Again, there is also the 900 model and I think a 300 model, each with fewer features, but still quality made."
"I ordered 2 Brondell S-1000 - EW Swash toilet seats after reading many reviews. The main reason I chose Brondell was because of good reviews and because it was the only bidet seat that allows you to sit on the lid. There are times I need to get into the cabinet and it is easier to sit on the lid. It works well and the adjustment are well thought out and it's easy to use. My only complaint and the reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the seat opening is smaller than my regular Toto seats that were removed to install the Bidet seats. It is also shorter than I would like. I am a heavy woman (big butt) and the front spray doesn't reach unless I sort of squat and lean into it. Maybe it is more my size than a design flaw? The back spray comes almost as far forward as the front spray does. It needs a longer arm for the front spray but it gets the job done with some maneuvering. As far as cleaning the rear, it does a great job the majority of the time but I did find residue once. I usually have to run the drying cycle twice to get everything dry, especially if I use the wide spray. Overall I love having the bidet seats and feeling fresh and clean after the go!! The deodorizer works well and the seat warmer is a great feature. Hopefully they will last a long time and I will get my money's worth. My son-in-law installed both seats in about an hour and didn't have any problems. He used plumber's tape around the connections as a precaution against leaking. I had an electrician install the GFI outlets next to the toilets for around $250 per outlet. I would recommend the Brondell S-1000 -EW Swash because it has all the features you need and so far everything works very well. The seat is very comfortable but I just wish the seat was a little longer and that the front squirter came out a little further. When comparing bidets, it seemed that they were all fairly comparable in size though."
"Wow! I should have gotten this a long time ago. As others have also indicated, using the toilet is usually a messy ordeal for me. I've known about bidet toilet seats for several years but assumed they were not very good. Thanks to online reviews, I did some research recently and, based on all the positive feedback for this and other brands, I decided to finally buy one. I chose this one because of the continuous warm water and the fact that it is higher pressure than some of the others. It is a godsend. No more need to take a shower or wash yourself ""down there"" afterwards. The water starts out lukewarm but very quickly - within a second or less - is at temp. The 2 minute wash time seems more than adequate to do the job but you can run it longer if necessary since this thing will not run out of warm water. The dryer does not get you completely dry but it does a pretty good job. I didn't think I needed the heated seat but it sure is nice to have! Very easy to install. My house is pretty new so the plumbing matched up well. When it arrived, I opened the box and thought to myself ""no way this only takes 30 minutes to install"". But I got stared and actually did finish in about 30 minutes. The instructions are not super clear but easy enough. The water supply hose has a 90 degree connector on one end. Instructions don't tell you where to attach it. I tried it on the ""t"" and on the bidet seat. It seemed about the same either way so I attached it to the seat - a 90 degree connector on BOTH ends might have been nicer. I had to use an extension cord and was able to plug it into a GFI outlet. Will get the electrician to install an outlet next to the toilet. I've only had this 4 days and I do not want to be without it. I am a single male - my family and friends may think I'm nuts when they find out I have this (it is in the master bath so most folks will never know) but I really don't care. If none of them have the same problems as I have, they will never understand anyway. A true bidet is nice but this is much better. Nothing you need to do except push some buttons on a remote. I can honestly say this is a life changer for me and I am so glad I made the investment."
"I purchased the S1000-EW Swash 1000 in late January of this year. I had been given a diagnosis of pruritus ani which is just a fancy way of saying something else. I thought I was going to have to have hemorrhoid surgery so the diagnosis was a relief. However the doctor said to not use a lot of toilet paper and no soap in that region. A bidet seat of this type was recommended by my doctor. He said he wished more people would use these but it is a hard sell. I went online and did my research and this one came out at the top of the list.

I got my Swash 1000 in January and it worked very well. Installation was a snap. It fits perfectly onto the toilet. It sure kept me clean too. And that is very important to me. All of the options for water pressure, water temperature and spray patterns were very helpful. The dryer is especially helpful for my diagnosis. I’m supposed to stay as dry as I can. So I even use the dryer after I get out of the shower or after a period of exercising.

My unit did stop working after I’d had it for about 4 weeks. Apparently the IR receiver in the seat wasn’t responding. I called Brondell and they sent a replacement unit out to me right away. They made it very easy to return the one I was having a problem with. The current one has worked flawlessly for almost five months now.

When I go out of town now, I hate having to leave this at home. I have to resort to the ‘old fashioned’ way of cleaning. I don’t like that much anymore because this bidet seat has spoiled me.

I highly and confidently recommend this product to anyone. Not just someone with issues. If you like to be clean and dry then get this toilet seat bidet. And – you can save on toilet paper too!"
"I bought the round version and it fits very well on my round toilet. It overhangs the front about and inch, but the whole thing looks like it built into the toilet. There is endless warm water at both the warm and very warm options and my favorite feature is the 'Move' option, where the nozzle slides front to back a bit to clean a wider area. The pressure setting a great and I am sure there is a setting that would be comfortable for anyone when combined with one of the three spray width options. The wide width on a low pressure should be comfortable for even the most sensitive person. I never need to aim the remote to use it, it works perfectly every time. I do with the setting indicator lights would stay lit continuously during operation and not shut off a few seconds after making a selection, but it is not really a problem.

I am very handy around the house and found it very very easy to install and hook up. It took me less than 10 minutes following the instructions. If you can install a new locking door knob than you should be able to do this as well without much trouble. If even that makes you nervous, get someone else to do it.

I did a bathroom remodel and had an outlet installed behind my toilet so all the power cord is tucked neatly behind.

I still use a little toilet paper just to check that I am clean, but I hardly use any and a 6 pack roll I bought 3 months ago still has 3 rolls left. I am the only one who uses this bathroom though. Occasionally I see I need to was a second cycle so I do.

I am extremely happy with this, I always wanted one and I feel I make the right purchase for the price. I highly recommend this product."
"When I got this product, I loved it! It was and still is the best thing I ever invested in. However, I bought it in October on the 6th 2023. It’s now January 4th and I noticed a hairline crack on the back of the seat, closer to the tank. It’s only getting longer with use. So I’m going to contact the manufacturer to see if they stand by their product and make this right. TBC…🙏🏼"
"This is my third bidet in various living spaces, and it is definitely the best of the three. It is easy to use and quite comfortable. Well worth the premium price."
"This is more of a wish-list for additional features, since the other reviews here are quite informative, and no need to repeat them.

I have an aged mother, 97 yrs old now, who is often incontinent, suffers from arthritis, but insists on ""dying in her own home"" instead of going into assisted living. So we have paid various caretakers to come look after her, but they often skimp on the personal hygiene especially after an incontinence episode. Due to her arthritis, my mother usually wipes back to front, when she remembers to do so at all, and thus gets frequent UTIs including the MRSA staph which is hard to treat since it is resistant to many antibiotics.

A couple years ago, I bought the AMDM Intelliseat bidet for my family's use, and after testing it for a few months, got one for my mother to use. Unfortunately she has old-age dementia and can't remember how to use the remote, so usually a caretaker has to operate it for her. The wash stream on the Intelliseat is very narrow and can be painful when on the high pressure setting. Best results are obtained if the user rocks back and forth and side-to-side, as the oscillation feature does not move the stream sufficiently back and forth, and not at all to the sides. So the user (caretaker) has to use the positioning button to move the stream from one extreme to the other, which still does not clean the cheek area.

So I thought I would try the Brondell Swash 1000, due to its adjustable width position, which should do a better job on the cheek area. Plus the aerated stream should be gentler even on max pressure. After my family has used it for the past few weeks, we find that yes it does a bit better job of washing a larger area, but not perfect. So I have given the Swash 1000 only 4 stars because it is 3 times as expensive as the Intelliseat ($200 from Costco back in 2013). The additional features on it (spray width, deodorizer, antibacterial coating on the wand, etc) are not worth an additional $400 IMO. It seems Brondell is charging what they think the market will bear, rather than based on reasonable costs. If AMDM would up their features, they could easily cut Brondell's price in half and still make a profit.

And now for the suggestions: First, if the wand could also be rotated a few degrees either side so that the stream could be aimed at one cheek or the other, without splashing outside the bowl, that would be useful for infirm or aged folks like my mother. She finds it difficult to tilt, rock or otherwise position herself on the seat, so to thoroughly cover the entire buttock area.

Second, for caretakers, it would be extremely useful to have a small video camera plus LED light, built into the seat mechanism, and a small monitor build into the remote, so as to enable the caretaker to see and clean any messy spots. This would reduce the number of trips to the shower and thus be quite useful IMHO. I recently bought an LED inspection camera for use in snaking wiring/plumbing through walls, engine port inspections, etc for $70. Granted this uses a fiberoptic ""snake"" with the camera and light on one end, and the viewscreen on the other, but Blutooth technology is cheap nowadays so a wireless connection between the remote and seat would not be difficult or expensive. I have even considered using this inspection camera with the Swash, maybe fastening it to the bottom of the rear portion of the seat, but it would get dirty quickly and be hard to clean, plus I'm not sure it would view the entire area. It would be much better if installed as part of the rear wand - the camera and light are very small, less than 1/8th of an inch diameter.

Finally, with the above two additional features, a small joystick on the remote would be useful, so as to steer the camera and stream to exactly where needed.

To me, the $600 price would be well worth it if Brondell included these additional features. Plus, I would think the bidet seat might qualify as a medical device if prescribed by a doctor, and thus might be a tax deduction, as it would enable aged or infirm people to stay in their homes a bit longer and avoid the $100K a year or more assisted living expenses.

UPDATE Aug 2018: OK, just like a lot of other purchasers here, the Swash 1000 started acting up last week some 3 years after purchase. First the remote only worked intermittently - replaced batteries which didn't help. Then some leaking along the sides started. Now the remote works better but the wand rinse won't shut off - drips continuously. The old AMDM Intelliseat however keeps on working and it is around 6 years old and 1/3rd the price. Cannot recommend the Brondell any more - for the price, it should work more than 3 years.

Latest UPDATE: I contacted Brondell and was told to send the bidet back to their SF location for an estimated $50 - $200 typical for out-of-warranty repairs. After considering the $600 I already spent, I decided to take the bidet apart and see exactly what was leaking. Turns out it was the wand rinse unit at the tips of the 2 wands, in the center front part of the base. There is a valve inside that turns on to rinse the wand tips when you first sit down and again at the end of the wash. If the valve gets stuck open, then water just keeps flowing, my guess is at least 10 gallons an hour, maybe more. Also the continuous damp conditions can affect the IR sensors at the top and side of the base, so that it appears the remote is not working even if you put in new batteries.

Anyway, I just spend about $20 in parts from the nearest big box DIY store, got a small quarter-turn shutoff valve and an 18"" 3/8th to 1/2 toilet fill hose and a 1/2"" male to male adapter, and connected them between the Brondell water inlet and the toilet T-valve that fills the tank and supplies water to the Brondell. I routed the existing 3/8ths to 7/8ths hose between the toilet tank and the back of the Brondell housing, which somewhat hides it, so that the new cutoff valve is about seat height on the right-hand rear side of the toilet. In fact, if somebody (my teenage son for example) leaves the seat up, you really can't see it at all.

So the toilet tank fills normally but to use the bidet, you turn the new cutoff valve on. If you do likewise, be sure to get a valve that turns easily - I took a bunch out of their boxes and tried them before I found one that I can easily turn with one hand.

Not the most elegant solution, but it works.."
"September, 2015 Update:

Below is my review that I wrote three years ago, after I had used the Brondell for a few weeks. At that time, I gave the Brondell five stars. I'm providing this update to explain why I have reduced my rating to 4 stars.

A few months ago, about two and a half years into my ownership (during which I've faithfully cleaning as instructed), the Brondell started malfunctioning about a third of the time. When it does, it gives an error beep and won't operate. I have found, about half the time, that if I turn off and on a few times it will work. The other half of the time, it just won't work for the rest of the day.

ORIGINAL REVIEW, written Sept, 2012:

After the first week of using this toilet seat, I had concluded that I didn't like it, and I was going to return it. Without going into the details, it didn't really seem to get the job done. In other words, I still had to use toilet paper after each use.

But, because it wasn't an easy job for me to get this operational (I had to have an outlet installed in the bathroom for one thing), I was determined to make sure I was using it properly before I decided to return it. Also, I was impressed at how well put together and solid it is. Nothing cheap at all.

I'm not one to read instruction manuals, but, in retrospect, I should have. The main reason is that this Bidet Toilet Seat is extremely adjustable and has many options. At this point, I can't imagine that it would not be the right fit (and I do mean fit) for every person.

Here are the things I learned, while using it, that make it a fantastic product:

(1) The water stream's strength is adjustable, from gentle to really strong. I prefer the really strong, because it gets the job done.
(2) The water nozzle can be moved forward or back.
(3) The water temperature can be adjusted.

Besides the seat itself, the remote control is what really impresses me. It allows you to do these things, and more, but you need to understand how it works (so, read the manual).

A couple caveats:
(1) I have modern electrical wiring, but the device, due I believe to the fact that I like warm water, causes my bathroom lights to dim when I use it. So, make sure you have an electrical system that can handle it.
(2) If you install it yourself, make sure you put the washer in the correct way, according to instructions. Put a different way, if you install it and you think you did everything correctly, but once you turn on the water you have a leak, that may be the issue.
(3) The front nozzle hasn't been used, so I can't comment on that.

One final note, after I purchased this from Amazon, the manufacturer still allowed me to purchase a reasonably priced extended and enhanced warranty from them. You have to purchase it within a week I believe and you have to send them a copy of your Amazon receipt showing that it was purchased ""new.""

In sum, after learning about its capabilities, I really like this Bidet Toilet Seat and highly recommend it."
"The bidet/washlet is very nice. The hardest part of the install was dropping a GFCI outlet near the toilet (put it on the right if facing the toilet). However, once I put the power socket in, installation of the seat was a breeze. There is a 3 minute YouTube video that you can watch that will explain installation (search for Brondell Swash 1000/900/300 Bidet Toilet Seat Installation).

- You can disable the sound from the seat and/or the economy mode via pushing and holding two buttons on the remote. Read the manual for instructions.
- The seat is a slow/soft close.
- After the water starts flowing the move button will cause the wand to move back and forth for a good coverage
- You can further recenter the moving wand by using the adjust front/back buttons
- The three spray settings adjust for laser beam focus/very strong to wide/gentle; on blue, my spray is very strong (almost painful) but your mileage may vary based upon the water pressure in your house and there is another adjustment for strength of stream
- The settings are very intuitive (seat temp: off-off; blue-low; pink-medium; red-hot)
- The dryer is functional, but honestly it would take about three 2-minute cycles to be completely dry. I normally don't have the patience and compromise with a less-than-perfectly dry result
- Hint: before sitting down I press the deodorize button to get the seat out of eco mode and see the current settings
- With the remote mounted within arms reach, I don't ever remove it from its holster and can simply operate where it is
- The seat is slightly wider than I would have preferred for my toilet, but I think it doesn't stand out as much as other geriatric institutional looking seats (see pictures)

Cons:
- Some opening space is taken versus a non-electric plain seat; however, not enough to complain, and I quickly got used to the new configuration
- There is about 1 second of room temp water when first starting and about half a second of room temp water when switching the spray width settings for the first time

As a man, I don't use the front spray; and so will not comment on that functionality.

I still take a single square of TP and conduct the wipe test. Usually the paper is spotless. TP consumption is plummeting (this is a big plus for all the tree-huggers; it takes a crazy amount of water to make TP (google it)).

Final Note: Extended family laughed at the large outlay of money for this bidet/washlet. But these same people spent more on an elliptical machine that is really a clothes hanger that is never used. I use this purchase many times a day (TMI?), and while a little expensive, it was a wise purchase for the large improvement in my quality of life.

2020.03.08 Update: The washlette started leaking several months ago. I found another review with a hint on how to fix it. There are two donut washers that need to be replaced with some gasket filler. This can be done with just a phillips and flathead screwdriver, as you only need to remove two phillips screws, flip out the appliances' innards using the flathead, and remove two other screws to replace the gaskets. I have attached three pictures to help identify the area."
"The Swash 1000 is a good bidet seat and I'd recommend it. It does the job well and when I'm traveling I miss not having it. Here are more details:

Installation: Installation is pretty easy as long as you have a nearby 15 amp GFI electrical outlet and a flexible water supply line to the toilet. It is just a matter of installing the seat, putting a T in the water supply line, and plugging in the cord.

Sizing: This is the round toilet seat, which I got to match the toilet where I wanted to put the seat. The problem is that the seat has a lot of features, and they have to go somewhere. Brondell puts part of the features over the back of the bowl, making for a smaller seat opening. If you are a guy this can make things tight up front. If you have an elongated toilet so you can get the matching seat and you are a guy you will be more comfortable. The seat is usable on a round toilet but just barely.

Cleaning features: The seat has separate sprayers for the front and the rear. I can only attest to the rear function. You can move the sprayer forward or back. I wish it went back a bit farther but it works well enough. You can also have the sprayer oscillate forward and back, adjust the width of the spray, and the temperature of the water. All very handy to get the coverage you want. You don't get as much of a spray as you do with a regular bidet, but you get enough.

Drying: This is one of the extra features of this model and it saves you having to figure out a way to dry off. While the drying is a net benefit, it rarely dries completely, at least in as much time as I'm willing to wait. You can adjust the heat level of the dryer, with the hottest being hot enough that you don't complain that they should make it even hotter, as I usually can't leave it there the whole time.

Seat warmer: The seat gets warm if you like. I got the seat in the spring so I haven't used that feature much but it should be nice in the winter.

Sterilizer: I don't have much to say on this. The heads move around and it appears to be doing something, but I'm taking their word that they are more sterile afterwards.

Deodorizer: I haven't done much with this, so not much to say here.

Now that I've written the review, I see that I'm picking out flaws, but overall I'm still happy I got the bidet seat and that I got the S1000. While some of the features aren't quite as good as they could be they are still pretty nice to have."
"I want to be able to tell you how much I love this seat, but there are too many problems to give it better than 2 stars. When it works well it is wonderful! I love the warm water option and warm air dryer (though even the full 2 min cycle won't leave you completely dry, we bought some toilet only wash cloths that I wash with the cloth diapers). I love how clean it gets you; I get really used to not using toilet paper...and then it breaks, and my bum gets sad.

This broke the first time within the first year, the front cleaning wand stopped working. I was told had to pay for shipping but the rest of the repairs were covered (the shipping was pretty expensive). Then it took us a little while to send it out (a few weeks) because we only have one toilet and this was our only toilet seat so we couldn't remove it till we purchased a replacement seat. That bumped us into the second year. We found out that they wanted to charge us for the repairs. After the first year you only get partial coverage (I'm sorry I don't remember the exact numbers but it is something like they cover 75% in the second year and 50% in the third) now this was upsetting because the main reason we paid the extra $400 for this model was for the 3 year warranty. I know it does say it is limited but usually that means ""limited to manufacturer defects"" not limited in the amount of repairs they pay for. I ended up getting the repairs covered as though it were in the first year after talking to them, but I still was without my toilet seat for almost a month.

It finally came back and the wand was working, but the heated dryer was broken. It just blows cold air, which frankly, blows. I was so annoyed by being without it for so long that I didn't send it right back. I assume that during the repair of the wand they broke the dryer, but I guess it could have broken in shipping somehow?? So, we held off and used it, well 3 months later the SAME wand broke AGAIN. Same as before it would only come out halfway. I was following the manufacturers cleaning instructions by using the cleaning setting and cleaning the wands with an (old) toothbrush and gentle cleanser. I again didn't want to send it right back because of what a pain it was so we held off, then the remote broke, then the other wand broke, so clearly I needed to call again for repairs. Instead of getting in touch with someone I get sent to voicemail. How frustrating! I just can't reccomend this machine for longevity, and for $600 that is important.

Finally a word about cleaning. It is a pain in the butt. First, because of the width of the machinery the round model hangs into the toilet, which might not be a big deal for some people, but if you have small boys, this leaves them less room to pee and somehow pee always ends up getting up under the seat (between the actual toilet rim and the bottom of the back of this seat) I'm not sure if it is from terrible aim, or if it is from pee splashing up from the toilet. Bottom line though this creates a serious stink fest, even when I remove the seat (with the little button) and wipe under it every day. Also there are SO many nooks and crannies in there that are all getting urine into them. It's just gross. I am going to be honest, I'm not sure how they could work around this, because the air vents are needed for the blower and such, but it is a huge deal to clean. In addition to daily wipe downs I have to spend about an hour at least once a week doing a thorough cleaning-that's just the seat itself, not the inside of the toilet and such. That is a lot more time than a traditional toilet seat.

I really like having a bidet seat because we are living in a rental and can't install a bidet, but I would suggest just going with a cheaper model than this one."
"Their customer service is dysfunctional. I called because the bidet was not even close to reaching female parts. I got the party line about the feed tubes for the water could only be so long or the base would need to be extended. So, if you are a woman and need front washing you need to use the adjust button on the remote to move the cleaning tube up as far as possible and then probably raise yourself up to get a thorough washing. I also found it appalling that the side buttons had a rear only button. Seems like the design was focused on men and not women. We did decide to keep it as it does help my 91 year old mother out. But the remote does not carry memory of the extended front position so I have to be there to ensure it works for her. I also found that if the move button on the remote was pressed, it again shortened the distance of the front cleaning. That was the problem when I called and talked to 4 customer reps at the company and none of them identified that that could be the cause of the shortened front cleaning. I find it interesting that the move is remembered by the remote, but not the extended front position. By working with the bidet for 3 -4 hours I finally feel that I know how to make it work at least minimally for the front position. For a $700 item, it is appalling what is not included, like memory for the remote. I also find it headed toward misogynistic in the lack of thoughtful engineering for the front female parts.

2 years later: I have used the bidet often as I developed colitis, and the bidet really helped ease my pain and to clean myself up after severe diarrhea. I now think it is a wonderfully built instrument and would recommend it to anyone. The difficulty it has with reaching front female parts still exists, but I have learned how to position myself on the seat to get the most benefit. My remote did stop working for some time. I called customer service and they said the price to replace the remote was $250. I found that a steep price, but it is a detailed remote."
"As so many others have mentioned, these electrically operated bidets can be among the most pleasant, hygienic and gratifying purchases you may ever make. Others have addressed the basic issues but, for me, the problem was in choosing the right unit. I wanted to compare this Brondell S1000 unit and the similar Bio Bidet BB-1000. Both are excellent and I don't believe you would be unhappy with either unit. There are some differences and neither is ""perfect.""

1. Power and versatility of wash: Bio wins with a huge array of options including an enema function and power enough to eject you from the toilet if you wish. However, Brondell has a gentler, variable-width main spray.

2. Warm water: Brondell wins with endless warm (not hot) water. Bio runs out of heat in seconds. In a cold climate this could be a serious shortcoming and Bio needs to re-engineer this with a continuous heater.

3. Deodorizer: Bio wins with automatic start when you sit down and more power with variable fan speed.

4. Remote control: Brondell's is smaller (about the size of a small TV remote) while Bio's is twice the size. Both are pretty clear.

5. Run time: Brondell runs for two minutes with ability to add more time, while Bio's stops after a minute and must be restarted. Manufacturers should make the run time programmable.

6. Installation: Brondell (by a bit). It has a far better water connection that connects at the toilet tank connection while Bio makes you run two lines from the angle stop. Not terrible but the Brondell allows a much neater connection. And you can use one of the ""auto shutoff"" water lines from the wall to the toilet adapter in case either the toilet or bidet supply lines should rupture.

That is my comparison after having used both for a while. If you combined the best features of both units you would probably have the perfect bidet. I know it's a bit silly to talk about toilet seat software but both units could use more programmability in the remotes. Brondell needs more power options and a better auto-start deodorizer while the Bio needs a much better hot water heater and connection adapter.

I do recommend you buy a bidet seat. You may kick yourself (in your very clean butt) for not having done so years ago."
"Expense is relative! This Swash is comfortably warm even before you sit down. Then, it cleans the air, washes where the sun doesn't shine and dries afterwards. What is not to like? This is my second Swash; the older model did not have the fan features to eliminate odors or to dry yourself. I could not be happier with this device but note that another reason why I bought a new model is because the old one developed a crack that got bigger over time. I hope that this one lasts, though it has a better warrantee than the other model.
Installation is fairly easy. The device comes with a T-connector which taps into the water line for the toilet tank; installing it is easier than you would imagine and will only take a few minutes. Then, plug it in and it works! I have noticed that the remote control (very handy, by the way) sometimes has trouble communicating with the device, but by simply pulling the remote out of its wall bracket and aiming it in front of you, it works every time. Sometimes a bathrobe that you are wearing may block the sensor, so you may have to move it around a bit, but this is not a big problem.
The heated water used in the device never runs out, so you can click the remote again once the timed cycle for spraying is over. Keep in mind that when you trigger the sprayer, it takes about fifteen seconds for the sprayer head starts as it has to move from inside the back and also the sprayer head gets cleaned; just be patient as you will hear it doing things.
Similar seats can be found in countries like Japan where many hotels have such seats, but those models quite often do not have the remote control.
Overall, I am happy with the Swash 1000.
Addendum: After almost two years, it stopped working. A short call to a very friendly customer service representative had them ship me new parts (IR sensors) which I was able to replace fairly easily. The parts and shipping cost only about twenty dollars as the warrantee discounted them. Had to take it apart, but the instructions were very clear and then replaced the old modules. Apparently, the IR modules go bad after a while, though they are sealed. I installed the new parts (just plugged them in) and put it back together and it works perfectly again, after I remembered to replace the drain plug (this was in the instructions - I just missed it). Very happy with both the seat and the service. Again, I highly recommend the 1000 model as the air cleaning/air drying feature is worthwhile."
"We did have to purchase a small yet essential piece of hardware so that it would fit - the plumber wasn't able to figure it out and told me it wasn't possible with my toilet, but the contractor who was doing our bathroom figured it out in about 2 minutes. It is on our Toto Aquia Dual Flush Toilet (CST412MF.10No.01).

I really like the bidet - it's a bit of a luxury for us. Ladies do have to ""scoot"" forward for get to the lady bits, but that is a result of water coming from the back (and the angle to prevent it from leaping out of the toilet onto the floor).

We have had this installed for almost 6 months now, and it works well - I like the multiple settings for the wideness of the spray as well as the temperature (in MN it is nice to have variation as the lowest setting is dang cold in MN winters, but refreshing in the summer). It does intimidate visitors and I often have to assure them that no water will surprise them unless they push buttons - which makes for a funny albeit awkward conversation depending on the comfort of the company (Friends? funny! New neighborhood board gathering? awkward.)

The only complaint I have is that one of the gray rubber “bumpers”mounted under the lid (it comes into contact with the seat when closed) has disappeared (likely flushed). I am not able to find or order a replacement on Brondell's website. I have written to them to find out if I may acquire that piece. I will update if I can get one. Meanwhile - I encourage owners of this Bidet to consider glueing the bumpers to the lids (they pop in and push right back in).

UPDATE: Within a few hours of my emailing Brondell to ask about how I can purchase the rubber bumper, they wrote back and told me that they will send me one free of charge. That's an epic win for customer service

Update: 4/2019: the water temperature is not consistent anymore. Brondell had me send the unit in and they replaced some part and sent it back (glad it was under warranty but it was a pain to find a box and not have a toilet seat for a couple weeks). It worked for another few months and then went back to the unpleasant cold/scalding combo. It’s no longer under warranty, but honestly I wouldn’t purchase again given the water temperature irregularities and that it wasn’t fixed long term after sending it in."
"We like the bidet but is has 2 problems within the ...

We like the bidet but is has 2 problems within the one year mark. Customer service at Brondell has yet to help us but we are trying. Problems: 1. the seat has a stain and 2. the water connector leaks at the base of the bidet on to the floor (we had a professional plumber install ours). The stain on the seat is confusing us because we only use warm water cloth to wipe down the seat. Brondell told us it was our fault, they said. ""The few times we have encountered this it is usually a beauty product of some kind that has gotten on to the seat and has baked into it from the heat, discoloring it. This is not something that is covered under warranty, but replaceable seat parts can be ordered for $45 plus $15.95 U.S. shipping if you want to swap it out."" we don't use beauty products near our toilet. owell
And for the leak, Brondell said: ""it looks like you have an internal leak and we’d want to bring that Swash into our service center in San Francisco for repair. Please send me your Amazon proof of purchase, if you purchased your Swash in July 2016 you are in the second year of your warranty and parts and labor will be covered 75%""
what??? here I am paying them to fix their bidet after it broke and discolored within one year. Here's the link to all of the things you are required to do once their product breaks. (disassemble, clean or get charged, get a box, pack it, ship and pay for it, wait for the fixed unit to return. in the mean time I don't have a toilet seat in my bathroom.
UPDATE: 12/22/2017. After sending it to them for repair, it came back repair two weeks later. So three weeks total no toilet seat in that bathroom, We used the guest bathroom
I thought I would use this as an opportunity to buy and install a new toilet bowl. I bought the One piece Delta Santa Rosa and the bigger seat would not install on it. You can’t get the water cables to go behind it unless there’s a gap between the wall and the toilet bowl. I had to return it and buy a Kohler that was a more standard 2 piece toilet.
A lot of work for a bidet seat but Brondell took care of me. I’m increasing my stars from 1 to 3."
"We have two Swash 550 seats in our home and we love them. The interface is simple and clear and they perform their functions well. I was looking to the Swash 1000 to upgrade those features, but I was disappointed. The Swash 1000 fails my usability tests in numerous ways:

* Swash 1000 does not have a control panel on the side of the toilet. There are a few simple controls on the side of the toilet, but they are impossible to see when you are sitting, and they do not cover even 10% of what you would need to use on the toilet. That is a big deal, because if the person using the toilet cannot find or figure out the remote control, there is no effective usage model for using the seat's features.

* The reason we really wanted the Swash 1000 was the deodorizing feature. We were putting the seat into a shared public bathroom. Unfortunately, the deodorizer does NOT come on automatically!! You actually have to press a button manually to turn it on. Come on and think about this Brondell: at least 70% of the people using this seat in a public context either a) won't KNOW that it has a deodorizer or b) won't feel comfortable invoking that feature manually. So you have largely just wasted what could have been a nice feature. To contrast, the BR30-RW Breeza Deodorizing Toilet Seat turns on the fan the moment you sit down and that is what makes the entire feature so useful. To me this is such an obvious and basic feature, and the fact they would get this so wrong in the Swash 1000 unfortunately hints at bad product management. Bad decisions like this seem to leak throughout the product's other features.

* The remote control is really the user interface for the entire product, and it is just not well designed. Just one example of that is how the same plus and minus buttons that set water pressure also double as a control for setting air temperature. It's entirely non obvious, and the control simply feels like it was designed by an engineer. I object to the way the state of each setting is not visible 24x7 - as it is on the Swash 550 - so that the next user can immediately ascertain the condition of the seat's settings. Instead you have to tinker with the remote to re-ascertain settings. Obviously they cannot show the state of the seat on the remote 24x7 because that would drain the remote's battery. That is why they SHOULD duplicate the controls on the side of the toilet: as a visual confirmation of the state the toilet seat is in, without any need to invoke a remote control.

If everyone in your family is high IQ, and if grandma, parents, and children all love to tinker with complex controls and side effects, you probably will have no problems with this product. For those of us who have at least one family member or guest who is not brilliant with technical things, this is not the product to buy. If you can do without the deodorizer, Swash 550 is the more usable product."
"Why in heaven's name would I buy a ""used"" bidet seat???? Because it isn't really ""used"" (set up, minus hooking up the plumbing, at a trade show doesn't equal ""used"" to me :-D) and it cost $200 less than a brand new one works for me!!! My Brondell Swash 1000 arrived on time, in original packaging, with all original parts. Installation was relatively easy (pay attention to the orientation of the plastic parts that look like buckles - pro tip - they go so the bar goes side to side), and except for breaking the fitting on my toilet's water supply hose and having to replace it, it went without any problems.

Personally, I find that the front wash is OK, but the dry setting isn't particularly effective for the front - I still need toilet paper to get dry (sorry - TMI, I know -but consider the subject matter). Otherwise, I'm delighted with it - and will never EVER fear another toilet paper shortage again! LOL"
"This is my second Brondell Swash. The First Swash had a sprayer that stopped working on one side and I didn't want to wait to send it off for repair because then I'd have to do without while it was in the shop. Sad but true, I have grown to rely on this device. Subsequently, the remote also failed on the first one, refusing to respond, so I had to repair both items which got a bit pricey.

Each time I had it installed by a plumber, so I can't comment how it is to install.

I CAN say the device is invaluable to keeping clean and hygienic and is super comfortable to sit on. The seat warmer is great too, although I tend to not use it. The seat isn't one of those cold porcelain seats and it just doesn't get THAT cold where I live so seat warming is only a once in a long while type thing.

After install, the device works perfectly. Use it and enjoy. Just remember to read the section on cleaning, and keep the filter and the sprayers cleaned to avoid damage.

The only thing I wish the Swash had was an authorized dealer and repair place so repairs can be done locally and quickly and installation can be done by someone familiar with the device. The second plumber who installed this was rather intimidated by the device and had never done it before- which is weird, because the first plumber who did mine 2 years ago, was not so intimidated, installed it quickly and complimented me on it.

The device has a lot of intimidating warnings about electrocution which I know are included for safety purposes, but which aren't confidence inspiring."
"I purchased the Swash S1000 in May of this year to replace an S300 that had failed after a year and a half of use. I apologize in advance for the awkward discussion but if you really want to know what the product is like certain features need to be discussed. So... features first: the nozzle oscillation is a major step up from the S300 and makes a big difference in coverage area - you can set the nozzle to move back and forth through a decent range - enough in fact that my wife can use either front or rear nozzle for feminine cleansing. The ceramic heating system does appear to give endless amounts of instant warm water, and the heated seat works very well and very quickly. The deodorizer works somewhat but let's just say that it doesn't stand up to a medium challenge - you're better off flushing than relying on it for that. The warm air dryer is useless - it moves very little air and you'll likely drip dry just as quickly. The wait time for the nozzles to deploy is significantly longer than for the S300 - I find myself wondering if something has malfunctioned until the spray finally happens. Overall, if this were the end of the story I would give it 4 stars because it performs its major functions very well and I wouldn't want to go back to not having a bidet at all after using this.

Second, then, some things that concern me: the nozzles, do in fact malfunction - maybe 5-10% of the time they make noise but never deploy. I usually have to unplug and replug the power cord to get it to work in those cases, though sometimes pressing stop and start get it going. Regarding the heated water, for the first few weeks if I tried to use the warm water stream it would heat the water to a comfortable temperature initially then suddenly shoot up to very hot; that issue lasted for a few weeks and disappeared just as I was going to contact Brondell about it. It hasn't reappeared since, so I don't know if it was a malfunction or if its something that happens with the new product and fades after some use. Finally, and this is the main reason for the two star review - it develops leaks. I went looking online and found many complaints about this and several videos posted showing the leaks. For us it started two weeks ago with a few drips near where the water hose fastens to the seat and I thought maybe the hose simply needed tightening. I didn't have time to address it until this past weekend and by then it was leaking from both sides of the seat in an intermittent stream. I sent the company a support request today; I'll update the review once they respond."
After 7 year it finally die... It was very close and long lasting relationship. Got it orginaly for my Mother for time when I was not home to help her. Yet she did not care for it. Yet I did find my self in love with it. Sense it make pooping easy when Constipated or the hot summer months when you wish to cool down. And life saver when there was shortage on toilet paper. Family is on the heavy side and not braking the seat every other month has help pay for the item. I will miss the wide spray that this can do... yet the blowing air drying is a joke... less you wish to stink up a place. Best to use a couple foot long wash cloth to dry off.
"We have used a variety of similar bidets over the past 30 years. However, this product is so good that we bought 2 of them.
- was crazy easy to install in only 15 minutes,
- the water temperature and pressure are great,
- the blow dryer is adequate (does it's job - albeit not quickly),
- the magnetic holder for the remote is fantastic,
- the seat is always warmed to a near-perfect to perfect temperature,
- and more.

I can't believe how well it does its job, too. No matter how messy things might be down there, this seat does its job thoroughly. No need, in fact, to follow-up with toilet paper. It is so easy to use that even my 6 year old niece loves it and wants one for use at home."
"First this bidet works very well. The remote is great, and the features of the Unit too.
But if you get an issue, which I got twice on a unit, it has to be serviced by shipping it in.
The first time a plastic piece in the water inlet cracked and started leaking. Easy to fix, if Brondell would provide the couple of $$ part. But they do not and required it to be shipped to their service.
The second time, shortly after it returned from service the unit stopped working. I am still troubleshooting with Brondell service, which are nice and helpful, but I am afraid will need to ship again.
2 breaks after a few years also gives me questions about how robust the unit is.
If Brondell could find a way to make the unit better serviceable and provide parts to end customers that would be a great help. Everything inside is modular, and a somewhat handy person could replace parts with no problems.

I took 2 stars off for that reason."
"Can anyone explain to me why we Americans have not hopped on board the bidet train? They've been using bidets in Europe for decades...almost every bathroom I've ever visited during my many trips to Europe has had a bidet. Even the cheapest hotel room in a low-rent district, or the humblest little water closet in the back corner of an unassuming trattoria, has a bidet. Most of the private homes we've been in had them in every WC. And yet we never find them in the US, unless you are staying at the Ritz or some chi-chi hotel populated by wealthy international clientele.

We just bought this. Now this might seem like an extravagance, but we did so because we have learned that the plumbing system in our 50-year-old house is rather fragile, and we were searching for ways to reduce the strain on it, thereby ultimately saving money in future plumbing repairs. Without being indelicate, let me just explain that using one of these can mean far less usage of TP. Which is not only good for our ancient pipes, but also for saving trees.

We got it today, and it's AWESOME! Easy installation. Heated seat (awfully welcome during these coldest days of the year), gentle stream of warm water, adjustable nozzle position for either...as they say euphemistically in the manual...""back"" or ""front"" washing. And some other interesting features too, which I haven't yet explored, and might not.

Here's the thing: Americans tend to be far more fastidious than other parts of the world, in terms of bathing frequency, general hygiene, germaphobia, etc. And yet we walk around with dirty bums, while our less-frequently-bathed European brethren walk around with nice clean ones! I don't get it.

Join me! Buy one of these and let's start a bidet revolution! Clean bums everywhere!"
"Everything was as stated and was very easy to install. It's comfortable as well. However... Maybe I don't understand bidets... Supposed to save a lot of paper, but your butt is soaking wet afterward. Even the blow dryer didn't thoroughly dry you so you're still using paper to dry off"
"To be fair, I have never owned a bidet so that might cause some to weigh my review lightly. However, I am SO pleased with this bidet! The water pressure is very strong, I have to turn that back a bit. I do not understand how many reviewers say that the water spray doesn't reach their ""lady parts"" as I don't find this to be an issue at all. But I must admit that it MIGHT be more of an issue if I were a larger woman, having less maneuverability on the toilet seat. If you are very petite, you can bounce around anywhere you want on the seat to make it work. If you are a larger woman, you can only back up so far on the seat before there is no more space left. The water is nice and warm and so is the seat. I DO wish the remote was lit so you could see what you are doing in the dark but I hung a small flashlight from the paper roll hanger and that works fine.

The customer service was also great. We have a more modern toilet and the normal hook up (at the bottom of the tank) was not possible since the hose simply goes into the tank, no separate connector there. I contacted the company, they got the toilet make/model and sent me a link to the part that I would need to make it work. All good! The seat looks sleek and modern just as the toilet is - very nice!"
"You know you're living the good life when you can go to the potty and someone else cleans your bum. Now I was never what you would call a foo foo kind of a guy and there was a time when I couldn't imagine using a bidet. The wife and I were first exposed to this kind of product when stationed in Japan with the military. These things are very popular in Asia and I admit that I was quick to get hooked. So when we built our new house here, we put two of these in the house (and a third will come in the future).

Advance planning is important as it has to have an electrical outlet pretty close to the toilet. Since we were building our house from the ground up, I could have outlets installed inconspicuously behind the toilet so the cord is not intrusive. Because of the potential draw with all the heater functions turned on at one time, your local code may require it to be on it's own circuit so you'll want to factor in those costs if you're doing a retrofit.

It fits reasonably well with our elongated toilets but if you think it will be a perfect seamless fit, try and remember that you're dealing with different manufacturers so that's probably not realistic. For me, they are certainly close enough. Installation is easy and can be accomplished in a short period of time, by anyone who is a little handy, with only basic tools (assuming the electric outlet is already available).

But you really only appreciate it after it's up and running and you're sitting on top. You'll wonder how you ever got along without one."
"UPDATE: Brondell took care of the product problem that caused the leak and we have not had a leak since. This is a great product. Sturdy and Brondell stands behind their product!
From prior negative rating:
I have reduced my rating due to building frustration about the quality of this product and having to put catch basins under my leaky toilet seat!!!
For the first year we lived the Brondell but then we started seeing water on the floor around the toilet.
Since it was dripping near the connection between the bowl and the tank I thought those connections were loose. I took the entire toilet apart and replaced everything including the wax ring on the floor connection, all the washers between the bowl and the tank, and even the entire insides of the tank. It looked fixed for 24 hours and started again.
It’s the Brondell bidet leaking! There is an access port under the main hinge area that loses its seal over time and leaks with a regular drip. I checked the company website and not only is the problem not covered, but there are also not any recalls nor options for a solution.
Looking online I saw several posts about the same problem. I should have done more research!!!"
"This bidet is the fusion of traditional comfort and modern technology and puts anyone with one ahead of all of the other cultures who have used bidets for the last century. My mother recently fell and after spending time in the hospital and nursing home I decided this was the single best improvement I could get for her . And it saves me from having to help her with the most difficult aspect of ""bathrooming'' as the nurses call it and it saves her from the same . She loves it and it makes her cleaner than she would be without it . If I had it to do over I might buy the model 900 but this model , the 1000 , has a nozzle sanitizer and a 3 year warranty. I did have to run an outlet down out of the attic because this is an older house but if you're in a newer house you probably won't have to . I ran an extension cord until I could accomplish this task . It's a snap for most people to install too . I do recommend buying a new toilet to water line hose when you do this because often times your old hose , while still good , has gotten very stiff. When you install the T your old hose will have to twisted or bent into a somewhat different position . While this may not be a big deal and it probably won't break why take the chance on a $5 part ?"
"This is my long term review of the Swash 1000. I've owned it since November 2011 and I just died on me this past weekend. Here is my experience with it.

Pros:
Heated seat works great
Looks great on the toilet.
Remote batteries last forever
Water temperature is good, there is a second of room temperature water when you start but i've experienced that on other bidets.
Easy to clean
Overall, it's a good performing bidet

Cons:
Water pressure, even on the highest setting is too weak for me. I've experienced Toto and their water pressure in the medium range was stronger than Swash at its highest.
The fan automatically stays on after you use it. It isn't really a Con since it's designed to filter the air after you use it. However, it's a bit annoying at night when the wife uses the toilet and the fan stays on after. You can stop it by pressing the stop button which is how we get around it.
It broke 4 months after the 3 year warranty.

I must say their customer service is great. The person responded in a timely fashion and tried to help me troubleshoot the issue. At the end of the day, i have to send it back not knowing how much the repair is going to cost and how long it's going to take. The person quoted me 45/hour for labor and plus the cost of parts and shipping. Therefore, i made the decision to just purchase another bidet. I am giving Coco bidet a try.

I did have a pleasant experience while it lasted."
"Pros:
Well thought out design. Well made. Looks good. Adequate cleaning.
Cons:
Drier sits off to side - doesn't dry even on hottest setting. You would need a drier nozzle like the sprayer nozzle for adequate drying to take place.
Oscillating water nozzle (Move button) needs to have more back and forth range. You will end up shifting around on the seat anyway.
Water pressure could be higher, especially for medium and wide spray settings. Probably subjective but others have mentioned it and I agree.
Conclusion:
Some very enthusiastic reviewers have recommended going for the S1000. The 2 features that the 1000 bring, oscillating spray and drier, are underwhelming and not worth the extra cost. You won't miss those 2 extra buttons. Check out the S300. It's presently $219 on Amazon and has all of the features you will use on a daily basis including heated water and seat temp setting s and water pressure settings. Some of us just have to have it all, but in this case the smart money is on the less expensive versions."
"First word that comes to mind is Life-Changing! I have had ""rear end"" issues forever and have been wanting a bidet for 13 years (ever since I moved back from Italy where we had the kind that is separate from the toilet). This is way better than the European version because:
- you don't have to move from the toilet to another device
- it's easier to use (just push the buttons)
- you don't have to wait for water to get warm
- you don't need separate plumbing
And for those of you wondering why you should get a bidet to begin with. Here's why you should:
- No friction (Ahhhhhh!)
- You end up much cleaner (so you feel refreshed afterwards)
- Use very little toilet paper (which also means you don't have to flush as much)
- Generally soothing and pampering
If you are a woman, there are a couple of reasons why this suits you particularly. I'll try not to be graphic, but the ""front"" spray is wonderful after you've had some fun with your hubby and during your monthly cycle.
Men, if you want to truly pamper your wife, as unromantic as this sounds, get her a bidet (there are romantic side effects). I recommend packaging it with other romantic things. And, guess what, you get to use it too. My husband, after me nagging him to get one for a while, said to me, ""why didn't we get one of these years ago?""
And that says it all..."
"I’ve thought about a Bidet for a number of years after a vacation in Europe. After looking at many, we finally decided on the Brondell S1000. We live on a property that uses a sceptic system, so we have also been concerned about using/limiting T.P., wipes and sceptic cleaning products and services ($$$). Those problems have now been eliminated! Although, the initial cost is something to think about, in the long run we think it “will” pay for itself in the savings of all the paper products. The bonus in using a Bidet is the ultimate feeling of being clean and refreshed. It has turned out to be a very satisfying experience for the both of us. The only criticism I might have, is that the Illustrations in the manual could easily be enlarged so visually impaired people could see how the connections go together. Beyond that, we are feeling very happy and clean. Thanks Brondell."
"Over the last 2 months, I have purchased and installed 3 Bidet seats (all from Amazon) in my house. Like others, I did a lot of research, reading hundreds of reviews and Brondell got high marks from all the websites I visited. This Brondell seat was installed in my guest bathroom where I wanted a straightforward bidet seat with fewer bells and whistles than the unit I installed in my master bath. This model has less ""fancy"" washing options but does its' intended purpose; cleans your tush thoroughly. The water stream is healthy (and adjustable) and does what you expect it to do. The dryer function is refreshing and overall I honestly like the look, feel and sturdiness of this unit over the other brands I installed. The Brondell remote magnetically attaches to it's holder which I really like and so far, the feedback from family (& me, as official ""tester"") has been excellent. If it had a night light, I would consider switching it with the fancier model I put in my master bath. An electrician installed the plugs required, and a handyman installed the seat...Took him about 20 minutes and he had never installed one before. If you haven't upgraded to a Bidet seat, I would definitely recommend this unit."
Pleasantly surprised how much I like the product. Can’t live without it. Which purchase again.
"If there is one thing I never talk about with friends is my Swash. They all think I am nuts. But if you are an individual that uses those wet disposable wipes, this is for you. Admit it - toilet paper on its own does not do the trick- what other part of your body would you wipe with dry paper and say you are clean? If you are thinking of this as a bidet you see in the European hotels, you are wrong.

First it is a heated seat, nice in New England. When ready you press the button and an oscillating nozzle that you can adjust the position of does it's thing. When finished it dries you. So personal that you can adjust position, whether the nozzle moves or stays in place, width of spray, water pressure and water temp. If you need to clean the air so to speak there is a button for that and finally even a sterilize one.

Final comment - if looking at models with the controls in the seat forget it. Trying to look next to you down at the seat is almost impossible. This model has a wireless remote you can put anywhere and in front of me on the wall is perfect.

My only request would bring back the lit seat- nice at night. Enlightening."
"This device puts the ""toy"" in toilet.
We bought this because of temporary medical conditions in the past in which we wished we had a gentile washer.
We waited for the unit to arrive before putting in the GFI outlet. Worked great because we were able to situate the outlet so a blue LED nightlight we plugged shine on, as well matches the blue LED on the seat. I am sure many would pay a couple of hundred just for warm seat and style. The automatic deodorizer when you are done is another great feature. The dryer is a little odd I am surprised it does not come with a tiny hair brush; it does help at the end to feel dryer though.
After using it for a while you wonder if it was really worth all the money, until you travel somewhere and go without it for a week, than you really miss the clean feeling you get. Won't go into details as I am sure must people will develop their own technique. A manually initiated multi cycle process much like any cleansing device seems to work best; defiantly get one with a remote control.
Really glad we got this. This is not a bidet in what many think a bidet is for; this is a personal hygiene devise to reduce paper usage, and give a gentler, cleaner, and more discreet bathroom experience."
"I love this Brondell Bidet! I recently remodeled two bathrooms and put a top of the line Toto in one and this bidet in the other. Both have pros/cons but this one is better for heavier folks and does a better job of washing and drying I think. Don't get me wrong, I also like my Toto too but for different reasons. Here's my take:

BRONDELL:

PROS:
-two separate nozzles for front and rear washing (Toto doesn't have this)
-strong spray but you can go softer too (Toto spray is less strong)
-narrow to wide spray (Toto doesn't go quite as wide)
-button to move the spray back and forth (Toto's oscillates)
-better coverage after bowel movements (our ""go to"" bidet for BMs)
-good dryer (the Toto smells foul when it dries you)
-effective wand sterilizer (Toto has this too)
-deodorizes well (Toto has this too)
-can take heavier weight folks (more weight than Toto)
-half the cost of the Toto high end bidet
CONS:
-if you want the bells and whistles of the high end Toto that sprays the bowl before and after using the toilet this one doesn't have it but I have a Toto toilet w/ the SanaGloss finish so nothing sticks anyway"
"We bought (3) as Christmas gifts for my mother-in-law who lives with us now....our teenage son....and of course....we put one in the master bath. We first discovered the multi-faceted toilet at a Ritz Carlton in Sydney Australia...then again in Kauai at the Sheraton. It's truly an amenity now within reach for the mainstream......and in our house....this pays for itself in just what we save in toilet paper. My wife and I are really getting used to the pampering everyday......and feel like this was a great choice. I looked at Toto and several others, but went with the Brondell based on the reviews. (I always read the reviews before ordering online) I am thankful for all of the good information, but what wasn't mentioned was the dedicated 15 amp breaker that each toilet needed. We ended up spending another $1500 to drop wires to dedicated plugs behind each toilet in each of the three bathrooms. Otherwise...we would have been tripping breakers all day. It was an expensive addition to our home....but one worth every penny. IMO.....:-)"
"These should be standard in every home . Hygiene at the next level! I have 2 of the brondell 1000’s and honestly don’t know how I did without for so long . My friend bought a different brand and I did not like it as much as these . One of mine is 5 years old now and it still operates like new . I went to Japan recently where bidets are standard in almost every bathroom , even some public baths! I sat on some fancy ones . But I still like my brondell over any I used . My next one will probably be the 1400 . It’s got a cool backlight ! Everybody get one , your butt will love it 😉"
"I tried one of these at my parents house and was pleasantly surprised how well it works. Theirs was made in Japan and they had to hire someone to install. The Brondell was very simple to install. Also the shape of this model was aesthetically pleasing to the eye compared to their model which is used in nursing homes. It appeared thinner and sleeker.

Easy controls to use. Setting on temperature, and width of stream very convenient. I opted for this model over the 900 because I wanted the dryer function, which works well enough, but I find myself sitting up before the dryer time is uo and using paper.

Of note, small children can use this while supervised by turning off the weight sensor function.

Very worthwhile purchase. I almost can't live without it.

Addendum: After 2 weeks of use, the stream stopped coming out intermittently. I contacted customer service and they recommended I reset by unplugging for an hour. As this did not fix the problem, Brondell sent me another product with return shipping for the malfunctioning swash. Was very happy with their customer service and have had no problems since."
"I ordered this high end bidet add on for our master bath toilet that my husband uses. He has a degenerative neuromuscular disease, and by all reports from our support group, a bidet was something that will make toilet sessions much better for him and his caregivers. Not to mention that I LOVE IT, TOO. I compared this product line to Bio Bidet, and one of the primary selling features for the electronic remote control models available was ease of remote control use. I am visually impaired and wanted something clear and straightforward, and the remote is perfect. I tried every feature on the bidet last night after I cam home and our handyman had installed it. I didn't even have to read the 26+ page manual to use it!

All of the features worked as outlined, and I am pleased with all the options. We went with the S1000 for all the comfort features, and we are both glad we made that choice."
"Update: they did get back to me after I complained and sent out a new part discounted per the warranty. I was able to repair the seat afterwards.

Don't buy. The warranty is not honored. Look at the many negative reviews from people with warranty issues. The customer support line does not answer and they do not respond to emails. Avoid this brand."
"No complaints with this. We made the switch to completely transition our entire house from paper to water and would never go back. Not only have we saved in having to constantly buy loads of toilet paper but all our butts are so much cleaner. I have used several water bidet brands including Xiaomi and water powered only brands. The Brondell is imo the best because the water jet is strongest and the controls to move the wand is a very critical and important ;) One thing I hope they improve on in the future is making the bowl ""larger"", like the Xiaomi -- which is why I removed 1 star."
"You don’t know what you’re missing

Relatively easy installation. Works perfectly."
The installation was so easy! The seat is very easy to use!
"We just installed our second Swash 1000. We have two homes and after putting one in the first one, I HAD to have another one. Installation is a bit tricky, so be sure and READ the instructions. My husband installed the first one wrong (it still works, but he ended up using tubing he bought). Now after trying to put the second one in, we read the directions and it's SO EASY to install.
I love the seat warmer and the water is at just the right temperature and pressure. I finally truly feel clean! If you can't afford to remodel your whole bathroom to put in a bidet, this is definitely the answer. In fact, if you ask me, I prefer it to a free standing bidet. It's much simpler to use, has a warm seat and an air dryer."
"Shear waste of money. So many problems over 2 years that I finally gave up on it. Repairs even under warranty are uber-expensive and don't last. Poorly designed components. (for instance: water heater housed in a plastic housing which lead to warping and water leak). The nozzle got stick and wouldn't extend. The unit leaked several times for various reasons. The unit became non-responsive to any input from either remote or side controls and had to be returned. At one point the water heater wouldn't shut off and water came out so hot it couldn't be used without repair. Return for repair cost $40, then I had to wait for 2 weeks for an estimate for repair which was well over $100 while under warranty. If you buy this item get at least one more so you have one that works while the other is being repaired. I gave up after total expense reached $800 for 2 years of use. I wound up replacing it with a $19 Qualitus bidet I purchased here on Amazon. And it works great because it is very simple in design. I found the seat heat wasn't necessary. And the blow dryer would take 10 to 15 minutes to dry my butt and became painful due to the exposure to the heated air for that long. The $19 one has much more pressure and cleans in less than 30 seconds whereas the Swash was much lower pressure and took 2 to 4 minutes (2 minutes each time you cycle it on). I just didn't know better when I purchased this being a first time user of this type device. Now that I know I wanted to pass along the wisdom to any who want it."
"Using one of these things is the strangest experience I can ever remember.

This is a great unit. Had it for a couple of weeks and it works great! A very strange experience but it works great!

I have a few problems at my age of 71. My bathroom experience can get sloppy at times. A unit like this is really good for my situation. I have to admidt, I could have considered one of the other brands but the Brondell is the only one you can use as a seat such. That was my main reason for selecting the Brondell.

I'm very happy with my purchase."
"i had this in my last house so it was imperative that i put it in my new house also. install is pretty straight forward. as i was remodeling the entire bath, i was able to run the AC to a new socket by the toilet. the water pressure here is a bit stronger so it gives even a better cleaning. the remote works great. the seat is comfortable (and heated). the only drawback is that the opening is smaller than the standard seat. not a problem as long as the boys in the house remember to lift the seat. if not there will be more splash-back. one problem with the toilet is that the water inlet is plastic, and i almost stripped it attaching the T connector. fortunately it's a standard float, even tho the rest of the works is pretty unconventional, so if it leaks, i can just replace the float as they are attached to the inlet pipe."
"The first time you use this or even consider using it, you might think to yourself, as I did, Really? But sit on it a few times, let it do it's thing and you'll make it your favorite throne to use! Especially nice on what could otherwise be cold mornings. Well made! All the parts are there to install it. Trust me! I made the mistake of not understanding one of the photos in the directions well enough and thought I had to go buy a special hose to fit it. Not so! I had a part on backwards. Totally worth buying."
"stallation: The installation process was very similar between the Swash and the Intelliseat, and shouldn't take more than 30 minutes. Both use a T-valve hooked onto your toilet's water supply to feed water into the bidet, but there are differences. The Swash's T-valve is a 7/8"" connection that fits between the fill valve connection under your toilet tank and the water supply hose. This greatly eliminates the probability of needing additional adapters because fill valves connections are almost always 7/8"", and you simply hook up the water supply hose to the T-valve, and the T-valve over the fill valve connection. The Intelliseat's T-valve fits between the water supply hose and the water supply valve from your wall. The Intelliseat's T-valve is made to fit over 3/8"" or 1/2"" if you use the included conversion nut, but I ended up having to shop for another conversion nut because the one that came with the seat didn't fit. Also, the Intelliseat's T-valve bottlenecks the wate"
"I had a Kohler C3-125 for a few years and wanted to upgrade to a few more features and the Brondell S1000-EW caught my eye.

After the unit arrived, it was pretty easy to install except when trying to align the seat backward and forward. Using the instructions, the unit can only be aligned left to right and not back and forth. After hooking up everything and waiting the prescribed time to ensure no leaks, which there weren't, I turned on the unit and tried it out. Everything worked as advertised for a few days. Now when I sit on the unit, water leaks out of where the sprayers come out for about 10 seconds. That isn't so bad. I guess it's part of the procedures.

Now when I push the back spray button, it takes about 30 seconds before anything happens. I didn't experience this when I first got it.

For the price, I sure expected an awful lot, but am feeling really let down."
"Remote works great. Installation was easy enough. No issues. Remote easy to operate.
Seat design would be better if front better conformed to curve of bowl. Someone else mentioned that as well. Works great, the movement of the nozzle features is great. You will save toilet paper money after 100- 150 years of constant service. You will have fun, but this not a toy. As a friend said,”once you get used to it, you never will go back.”"
"Works Great. Lasted a little over two years before leaking (when using the pressurized water spray). This is one of those items that, once you've get used to it, can't live without. I'll always have one now, but hope to find a brand that can last a little longer. These Japanese style bidets do have a lot of tech and moving parts (under pressure) so it may be that all brands have a fairly short lifespan. Brondell does have a 100% one-year; 75% two-year; and 50% three-year warranty. You pay for removal, shipping, and reinstall (though most folks should be able to handle removal and reinstall)."
"This is the first bidet seat I've owned/used. I like the bidet idea for cleaning but it does not compete with a personal shower between the legs experience. It is however a lot easier and quicker than a mini(?) shower. This is an expensive unit, in my opinion, and the plastic that covers the buttons on the side of the seat is peeling off, that doesn't seem right to me but I don't use those anyway. I've had this for two weeks now and as one reviewer said the remote is not lighted so, at night you have to turn the room light on to see what you are doing with the remote. Also I think that the spray pattern should be adjustable to a much wider area and the water pressure adjustable to a greater strength to accommodate a wider pattern. Overall I like this unit and its features. Would I recommend this to a friend... I think not at this price point ($599)!"
"I will never be able to go back to life without a bidet seat. They are wonderful, and completely worth some expense. After I had my baby, they were a lifesaver. For those of us in cooler climates, I highly recommend endless hot water models. Bidet seats have also allowed our family to eliminate the use of toilet paper and its accompanying lint and irritation and replace it with cotton wipes that we pat ourselves dry with, and then just wash with baby's diapers.

That being said, this seat was wonderful for two years before it started leaking onto the floor. I purchased two Swash seats for my home, a Swash 800 and a Swash 1000. Each one started leaking after two years of use. Unfortunately at two years the warranty only covers 50%, and the customer also pays for shipping. I didn't feel it was worth the expense considering the risk that it could break again soon and no longer be covered under under the three year warranty.
I also have a Coco bidet that I paid under $300 for with all of the same features as the Swash 1000 except the controller is attached. It is not quite as nice, the spray isn't quite as precise, but if it only lasts two years I won't feel quite as unhappy as I am right now with this expensive seat in my trash."
"Hi I received the used swash 1000 and it was covered in a light coating of feces, i figured i was getting a good deal so i cleaned it. then found that crucial parts were missing, toilet bracket piece and a washer in the tee. I was able to get these from Brondell though it took awhile and i found out that they sell reconditioned ones for the same price $349 that are not covered in feces which is good to know for all of us. I then proceeded to install the seat and found that the usable opening in the toilet was reduced by half which would make the toilet unusable for all but the smallest of men. So i am returning this one, now cleaned and with all the parts (I think?) except a manual, that was missing too. and purchasing an oval model for $399. thanks"
"Purchased this Brondell S1000 Bidet in mid-November 2017 and installed on Thanksgiving day (giving up my quality time w/ the in-laws, wink-wink) to surprise my wife and she loves it. Installation instruction was easy to follow. The only time consuming is installing the electrical wires, GFI grounded outlet and patching existing drywall. I wanted to write a review after a month of many uses. We're are so pleased with this Bidet I am debating of buying another for our Jack and Jill toilet, but its a big ticket item and keeping an eye on future discounts. With the possible new tax law, I don't think it would be enough to cover a new bidet! But all-in-all its well worth and left me feeling refresh each used and the rest of the family loves it too!"
"So far so good. Spray is not wimpy and has a few different setting. The front wash, for ladies, does require some maneuvering though - it just doesn't get to the right bits on its own. Easy to install - especially as it was a replacement for another brand that crapped out. Sorry. Couldn't stop myself. Still, for the price, you'd think it would hit its target. But - I'm happy with it and now that I've had this type of toilet seat, I sure wouldn't want to be without one."
"This is amazing! Very easy to install and very, very pleasant to use. I'm extremely happy that I spent the extra for a drying cycle because I truly can just walk away. My wife tells me the front washer works well but the dryer has a little trouble getting all the way to the front. The most difficult part was getting an outlet installed beside the toilet. The control is very user friendly. I leave the seat heat turned off because it, otherwise, stays on all of the time which is a waste of energy and environmentally unfriendly. The water heater and blower heat only come on when the seat is in use. Yes, there is a sensor in the seat so your toddler or curious neighbor cannot squirt water all over the bathroom. Toilet paper use dropped to almost nothing."
"After trying a similar seat in a Japanese museum, husband and I realized it would be a good addition for us, as we've had more than our share of physical problems in that area (surgeries and other issues.)

Being able to be washed every time has been wonderful, and has dramatically cut down on use of toilet paper. The Swash 1000 has a ""motion"" function where the nozzle moves back and forth. Also, pressure, width of stream, and temperature can be adjusted. I feel lots cleaner, and never have to overuse tp.

I highly recommend this to people who have had any sort of bowel surgery. It's worth asking your dr if they can write a prescription to see if you can get a medical write-off.

The negative is that the ""female's nozzle"" does not extend far enough forward to wash the front area. This really is just for the back.

I love it, and know I'll really appreciate when I prep for a colonoscopy next month!"
"Love the bidet! It is one purchase I wonder why I did not make sooner. The water stays warm long enough to complete a wash. I was worried that an in-the-lid bidet might not work well, and I do not have room in my bathroom for a regular toilet and a plumbed-in bidet. I was also concerned that it took a long time for hot water to get from my water heater in the basement to the bathroom so I would also need a tankless water heater installed near the plumbed-in bidet so I would not waste water. This in-the-lid bidet does all I need, and is a quick and easy solution. For smaller children, the seat sensor can be turned off because sometimes they are not heavy enough for the sensor to work. Because the bidet needs an outlet to function, I had an electrician install one within thee feet of the toilet. I also like the air dryer and deodorizing functions."
"Ordered this for a 96-year-old woman who lives with us. It's really a godsend! We weren't sure how it was going to work out, but it's perfect for her! Not only does it get her clean, but the water is warm, she can vary the water pressure, the warmth of the seat, the width of the water spray, and it blow dries her at the end. Just what she needs! State-of-the-art! So pleased with it for her sake. We operate the remote control for her, by the way.

Wish we could afford one for our own toilet! :)

Additionally, we bought a seat riser with handles as an accessory. The bolts with it were not the correct type, so I called Brondell and they sold us what we needed. They knew exactly what I was talking about without having to explain.

Great purchase. Glad we did it!"
"We bought an s1000 5 years ago and loved it . Then we bought a second home and a different bidet seat with similar features that was less expensive. It was not as solid and sometimes would leak. When it was time replace the first one because it finally stopped operating, we got another s10000. It worked immediately and all I had to do was disconnect and slide out the old seat a slide in the new one. The old remote still works and the new one fits in the old holder. It even arrived a day early. I am completely satisfied."
"I'd never even thought of having a bidet......until I tried one a good friend had recently installed. Loved it. Searched manufacturers for different features, price points and warranty. This was a long term investment so I decided upon features most important to me: continuous heating, remote, nozzle position adjustment, warranty. This was a birthday present to myself (and yes now my wife is a big fan too).The Brondell S1000 had it all. Unit was very easy to install. Unless you have the proper the length flexible waster hose connection, you'll have to install one. Easy. Also had to install an electrical outlet in bathroom (less than $100 for electrician).
Love the warm water, air, seat. Now ""finishing business"" with a smile :-).
Richmond, VA"
My wife ordered this and though we've only had it for a few days so far we both love it and wish we'd had one of these years ago. Given the reviews on the dryer part we were pleasantly surprised to find it did an adequate job. One reason I'd recommend the Swash 1000 to older people is the remote has large buttons that are easy to read and all the functions are clear and easy to understand. Another advantage is no more toilet paper (except for a bit of a blot). As much as my wife uses that's a big savings right there. It does everything we need and my wife especially likes that there's both a deodorizer and sterilizer. I like that Brondell uses stainless steel for the important parts.
"I have just returned from a month-long business trip in South Korea. The hotel room had an Asian-style electronic bidet. There were no instructions in English but I decided to give it a try anyway. From that moment, I was hooked. So much so, as soon as I returned to USA, I ordered the 1000 model and installed it on Christmas-eve. Fortunately, there was a convenient power socket on the other side of the bathroom wall so installing a new GFI outlet was easy. While waiting for delivery, I down-loaded the installation manual so I could make the necessary preparations before it arrived. The manual is very clear so there were no surprises. I particularly like the power saving features and the ability to turn off the heated seat off when the bathroom is already warm enough.
I am 100% happy with this product but a motion-activated bowl light would be a nice option."
"Love it. Due to my disabilities with MS my hands don't work so well and using toilet and toilet paper was more than challenging. I have now been using this product for over a year now and can't imagine living without it. It took a little time getting used to using it but it gets the job done. I only use a little toilet paper now to absorb the bulk of the water before using the dryer to dry things up. The only caution you need to have a gfi outlet behind your toilet to plug into. Luckily my father did this easily from power on the opposite side of the wall.
A great add on to make your toilet a throne worth sitting on."
The supply pipe leaks. It works well apart from that. No remote control was included with this. The information is misleading.
"I went to Japan in 2013 and fell in love with their talking toilets, and have wanted one ever since. My wife broke the toilet recently, snapped the porcelain when she plopped down on it drunk one night, so I had an excuse to get new elongated instead of round toilets. It was finally the perfect time, since these seats only come in elongated.

My review? Instead of 3-4 baby wipes to make sure my colon is squeaky clean, it now only takes half of one. Warm seat, warm water, warm dryer. Install was easy, despite having to get an electrician to come in and put a GFI plug near the toilet. But come on, if you can afford a $600 toilet seat you can afford an electrician to install a plug. Couldn't be happier with this product."
"The way to love thy butt the way it was intended by the Maker.

Forget the toilet paper. Forget about hurting your tush with rough paper, newspaper or a napkin. Enter loving your but whole with passion.

Not only it fit perfectly onto our toilet, but it was a breeze to install. My girlfriend installed the water connection in about 30 minutes total, and I ran a power cable in another 15. Which means that 45 minutes after opening the product we had a heated seat, remote-controlled washing, drying, and we couldn't stop playing with all the options for hours.

Now that I've had this for a few weeks I must say that the excitement is unabated. Great product, great functionality, solid, robust design."
"I was not on the market for this until after finding myself needing shoulder surgery for both shoulders after an auto accident. I purchased this unit in March 2015, and after moderate use in a two-person household, it failed to work completely in May of 2016. Naturally, just a short time after their one-year FULL warranty had expired. Now I'm stuck having to ship back at my expense and paying 1/3 the cost of whatever they charge to fix it. Fortunately, my shoulders have since healed and having one of these contraptions is no longer a necessity. So rather than incur even more expense, ""fixing"" it, I just went back to having regular toilet seat again.
As for its functionality during the 14 months was operative: The nozzle and heater and remote control aspect seemed just fine. Though I have no basis for comparison. The dryer takes forever though, so plan on still using TP to dry if you don't want to just sit there all day. Also, the bottom seat is not made of strong material, so it is very prone to scratches from fashionable rhinestone belts or anything else edged or sharp that it comes into contact with. There is also no part replacement for the lower seat listed on the manufacturer's Web Site."
"I never thought the day would come where I invite friends and family over just to drop a deuce at my house. I’ve always wanted a bidet but was ignorant about the product. I thought it was a whole new appliance that needed a large space for itself. I finally did some research and pulled the trigger on the Swash 1000. As a disabled person it only took about 30 minutes to install, I did buy the Brondell filter and that added a few minutes. This product is amazing, the water temps, movable water flow, heated seat and air, it does it all. As a 6’1 230 pound man I’m not proud that I giggle like a 12 year old girl when I use this bidet. It has changed my life a saved my marriage."
"Not sure what more to say about this item except that it's wonderful: solidly made, attractive, comfortable, and highly functional. It fit my 1960's era commode perfectly. Although I did have a plumber install it because my experience has been that any changes to an older home entail surprises, it was fairly straightforward for him. I chose to also buy the water line filter as my area has hard water; unless a home has a water filter/softener installed, it seems prudent to add for a small cost to preserve the life of the unit. After using this top of the line model for @ 2 months, I am happy that I didn't choose to buy a model with fewer functions. I was lucky to catch this item as a Deal of the Day and saved substantially."
"The s1000 is a very nice quality bidet seat. It has all the features of a top end seat. We've had several other seats in the past and this Brondell is far superior. Installation was easy and straight forward. I did have a problem with their swivel but solve my issue. Contacted Brondell about this swivel issue and receive fast and curious solution from their customer support.

The most import aspect of installation is you will need access to power.

The seat uses a flash water heater so you can run for as long as you need. The remote has a magnetic cradle and of excellent quality.

In summary excellent bidet seat."
"The unit goes in easily and looks great. I had two issues: the water did not get warm enough. When I contacted the company I was told that the water temp had preset maximum and using the spray etc would cool it down, it was the spray and extra features that I was paying for. The second issue was that it didn't hit the right spot on the bidet mode. There were a limited amount of adjustments that could be made. Again I called the company and was told there was a learning curve and I may have to adjust my position. The people were nice enough, but I had used another brand at a friends house and did not have these issues. Thus, I returned this unit and am waiting for another brand to arrive."
"This unit is everything I'd expected. Installation was very easy, although as others have noted, providing AC power can be a bit of a problem. It's been great, and it really does make a difference. Reading other effusive reviews I wondered how realistic some of them were, but here's yet another effusive review. I've turned off the heated seat feature, as a cold toilet seat has never been a problem. I wondered about the value of having presets for different users (not a feature of this unit), but now I think that's not at all necessary. My wife reports that both sprayers seem to be appropriately placed, contrary to what some other reports felt about the front spray.
It's kind of funny to appreciate how hard it is to change lifelong automatic routines. Remembering to reach for the remote rather than the TP still isn't automatic."
"I bought this Brondell S1000 Bedet because Consumer Reports rated it the best in it's class. Although a bit pricey at $640.00, it is worth every penny. The remote control is easy to read and understand, and it gets the job done. It has so many features, that actually work, that both my wife and I are thrilled about a quality product that does everything that it claims to do. Be sure to get the measurements right before ordering. I highly recommend this product. It is the new age in commodes."
This is a top of the line made very well. Installation was easy. They have a great support assistance. I received a U-Tube video that answered my one question about seat adjustment. We ordered our Swash 1000 on Amazon Prime. The unit is made very well. Looks like it was made for my tollett. Has lots of features. Including remote control. Instulation was very easy. I did it myself and I’m the lady of the house. My neighbor told me about the Swash. My husband is getting ready to have shoulder replacement and we really needed this.
"I was determined to find the perfect bidet seat and after using it for several weeks, I think I can say this is the one. I read everything I could from all sources including the one at Apartment Therapy and this model and style seemed to me to have everything I wanted. From the other reviews, I learned that the elongated seat was a better, more useful proposition. We had a standard seat toilet and I replaced it with the elongated Toro that was recommended on the Brondell site. I had a plumber install the toilet and the seat at a cost of $80. He did in 30 minutes what would have taken me all day. I bought the Toto on line too and it arrived in perfect condition. So happy with this project. And by the way, the remote is easy and intuitive to use."
"We were recently remoldeling our cottege master bath, so I started reviewing items I would like to have in ""my"" bath and a bidet was something I found interesting. After 3 days of reading and researching I selected the Brondell 900, and my husband wanted one for his too. I ordered 2 and when they arrived I realized I wanted more bells and whistles, returned the two, paid postage which was not cost effective for us but since I made the wrong choice, it was a just expence. I then ordered 2 of the S1000 Swash Bidet seats. WE LOVE them and have NEVER regreted the cost. As we are both health professionals I love all of the features offered and would give them a rating higher than 5 stars if it was available. Thank you Amazon and thank you Bondell for an excellent product. Texas tried and true!"
"Installing and using the Brondell S1000 imbues one with a sense of having arrived. A yacht with a helipad might serve that function in an Russian oligarch, but for a middle class American, this daily luxury is all one needs to feel, ""I've done alright."" The seat warmer brings the seat to a comfy temperature within a minute of sitting, the sprays with their adjustable locations, pressures, temperatures, widths, and oscillations are a revelation. Installation is a breeze, the warranty is 3 years long. A caution, for anal-retentives, the seat will make relief anywhere else seem positively primitive, accentuating this personality trait until one can return home to civilization."
Easy installation; got it yesterday and took only 1 hour to install. All functions work and so far the only function of silent mode has not been used. I used it a few times and my wife likes it so far. It is good price compare to Toto unit. Her parents have two units from Tota but one of them does not have the same features as Brondell S1000.
"Got 4 of these. We had already requested the gfi power sockets when we built our home hoping that this product will work out. Installs in less than 20 mts. The pipes for the bidet attached to right under the toilet flush tank and hence irrespective of your plumbing to the wall , you should have no problem installing.

Water pressure is great , all functions work as stated , seat temp , water temp, water pressure , air dry temp , moving back and forth oscillations of the bidet water sprayer.

It does have a weight sensor and if you have a kid around 40 lbs , then they might have to sit with their legs a little wide to trigger the sensor."
"Like everything about this product (except the price). But it was worth every penny. I installed it a few days ago and LOVE it. Husband has mobility issues and this makes it easy for him to attend to bathroom duties. We bought it to help him but I am quickly becoming addicted to it's features for my own use. Warm seat, less(0r no) TP usage and a nice warm air blower for my bum. Installation was easy as we had a plumber set up the water connections. I took care of the rest.."
"OMG, this bidet is great! Comfortable and works great. You can control the rinse-off stream water to be made strong or weakened. Seat warmed. Dry off was also nice. I am a female ""non-plumbing"" type & plumbing projects are not my forte however, after watching the Blondell S1000 You tube film, I was able to install it myself within 1/2 hr . Very easy. Didn't have to use a wrench on anything. All hand tightened. By the way, a plumber quoted $250.00 to install it for us.

The only thing I would improve this product on would be in illuminating the remote control buttons for a dark bathroom."
"Anticipating wrist surgery in the near future AND a remodel of my only bathroom, the only option that I had was to get a bidet toilet seat. After comparing the best brands and models within my budget, and because the reviews were similar to my needs and wants, I chose the Brondell S1000-EW Swash in white. It is FABULOUS and much more than I expected. It is quiet and very easy to use. Had I know it was this nice, I would have purchased it sooner. This Brondell S1000 EW Swash is well worth the money, works as described and is wonderful for us ""older people"" who have joint issues. You will be happy with this purchase! Go ahead and buy this......you deserve it!!"
"Update 5/19/18: less than three years after installing this it's headed for the garbage. Started leaking about two weeks ago, couldn't figure out where water was coming from. It's leaking internally. I'm out $480. Screwed inside are all rusted out, and as indicated, irreparable leak. Warranty might cover half cost of repair. Buy something else.

Just received and installed. Installation was simple, device works as advertised. Problem is that it's not really elongated. My Toto ss-154 seat was 17.5"" long (Rearmost seating area to outside front lip, with a 12 inch length of cutout. The Swash is 14.5 inches long of usable seating area, and the front lip is 2"" short of the front of the bowl. You can slide it forward, but you're sliding the whole seat forward and have lost 2-3"" of sitting area. No bueno if you're a big guy like me. The seat is deceptive when closed as it looks much longer than it really is. When you open the lid you realize there's a 4"" offset to the seat from the lid hinge. The overall opening is about an inch shorter than the Toto.

I'll follow up later with impressions after some use."
We are enjoying this bidet with one exception. The dyer is not positioned correctly to adequately dry the area one wants dried. The remote has a feature to move the spray but not the dryer. Therefore it is still necessary to either use toilet paper or a towelette.
"Brondell is way more than I expected. Seat warmth just right, water heat adjustment makes it a pleasure to use and leaves you clean as a whistle. As for drying it takes a few minutes but when finished it gives you a comfortable feeling. If you have a septic system as we do the Brondell is an added plus. The price of the brondell is nothing compared to replacing your septic system. Our system should last much much longer because we don't use toilet paper anymore. So this makes it a must have for me. I have Ankylosing Spondylitis a severe form of Arthritis and have a hard time bending so its pretty hard to know if your clean. Thankfully that's a thing of the past."
"With my electrical in place; install a breeze.
Now with the seat in position; I sit if you please.
The seat warms my buns as I settle in,
I comfortably rest as my business begins.
With my movement complete, I anxiously deploy,
a steady stream of water to my pleasure and joy.
I’m now confident to know, my tush will be free,
of all unwanted fowl but consequential debris.
With my task near its end; the drying begins
And I ponder the review to neighbor and kin.
My brondell exceeds all expectations
And I heartily recommend it with no hesitation
If you are ready to buy the best in bidets
Order yours now; you’ll have it in days."
We bought this unit 4 years ago and it is a great unit. However after a bit over 1 year a leak developed. We made the mistake of calling a plumber thinking the toilet needed a seal. After that expense and realizing it was the seat we had to send it back for repair but even though there is a 3 year warranty the repair was discounted but not free. Free repairs apply only if it breaks within 1 year. Now after 4 years the seat has cracked in 2 different places. (We are not heavy people !) For $600 the quality should be better. Made the mistake of buying another Brondell unit on which I noticed a crack one month after the warranty expired . It was in a abasement unit which had barely been used. Brondell refused to stand behind it. We have also owned Toto and Alpha units both of which lasted far longer with no problems at all.
"I brought this bidet 1.5 months ago for my parents in law. Coz, one of them wear the adult diaper, which required few times cleaning a day. This make everyone's life much easier. And the best part is the remote control. Coz. if they ( elders) can see the control panel that any younger family members( helpers) can manage for them.
Totally love it. That's why I order another for myself. I did a lot of homework and comparison, for sure this make is the best value and comes with the longest period of warranty."
"Great deal compared to washlet (I have had washlet elongated three years) Same features, handier remote. Added to our second tiny full bathroom so had to buy round bowl style to not hit the door. Round bowl still works comfortably and flips up easily. Easy close lid just takes a tap to close. Neither this nor the washlet (elongated) adjust quite far enough forward for lady wash and require adjusting where one sits back but it's a minor deal. Not seeing rolls of toilet paper used up in this bathroom anymore. Nice to see the lid always gets closed too. Heated seat is appreciated especially since our house is on a concrete slab where the floors get cold.

Great value!"
"To date I have purchased 3 of the units through Amazon, and I have advised family members to consider evaluating and purchasing also. Personally, I think all Americans should consider owning a bidet toilet or a bidet toilet seat. The reason, obviously, is to prevent trouble and to manage the health of the terminus of our digestive systems."
"Play Video
 Okay, to be fair I think at least part of my excitement for this review is just owning a bidet. Going from toilet paper to a bidet made me realize how frigging gross my life has been all the way up until this moment. I was convinced to get one when a friend of mine made the comparison to washing my hands. ""If you got poop on your hand, you wouldn't just wipe it off. You'd wash your hands."" My God, he was right. All we've been doing this whole time is smearing poop on our butts. Well not anymore! Now that I got that out of the way my thoughts on this specific product are as follows.

Pros:

Warm to hot water. I did try a bidet prior to this purchase at my friends house and did not like the sudden shock of cold water crashing into my rectum. So I decided I NEEDED warm water at the least. This has hot water, warm water, room temp water, or the cold water. The hot water is instant and I LOVE it.

Position. You can change the position! A front wash was a must as my wife also wanted to use the bidet (duh), and it's great! I even use it, I'll actually push the buttons to go back and forth to get everything, it works perfectly!

Pressure. I use gentle, and I'm SO glad that's an option, it doesn't finger blast my hole in the mornings. That being said, the pressure can get STRONG. So strong it hurts lol, I'm sure someone will use that setting so I'm glad it's there, but also I'm VERY glad it has a gentle setting lol.

The LED light is coo, but not necessarily worth reviewing, it's not like the night light is effective when the lid is down (put your lid down guys). I do kinda wish it was like a UV light for a disinfectant? But oh well lol.

The install was straight forward. The ONEE little thing that annoyed me is that the pipe that brings water into the bidet is so close to the control panel, that it was a PAIN to tighten. I did it but it was ROUGH. Like, give it a few extra centimeters dang lol.

The HEATED SEATS WERE A PLUSSSS
I did not need heated seats, and to be honest I had no clue these had heated seats, but GAWD they are good. I put mine on the medium heat, and honestly I just leave it on, so I'm always going to the bathroom with warm seats lol.

The soft close lid. My wife likes that I can't slam the toilet seat down anymore. I also appreciate that however, it does seem like only a month in and it's slightly started to wear. I don't ""push"" the seats down ether, I never have, I always just drop the lids (hence the previous crashing). The first week of having these it was slow all the way from the top to the bottom, but now it falls faster and only slows down towards the middle. I hope maybe that's where it stays and it just needed a little breaking in but if it gets worse I'll update the review, not a deal breaker and I'm sure I can tightens some screw somewhere lol.

GOOD PRODUCT, 10/10"
"Super easy to install-- I love that they have an installation video to watch. Works great and has all the features I wanted, plus no problem fitting my toilet."
Bought it as a gift a year ago and it’s the first time we’ve used a bidet. We will never go back to non-bidet. Install is simple and after a year it still looks and works like new. Heated seat and heated water are a bonus. Probably the best thing we’ve bought all year.
"So far so good. I liked the magic clean we had before a little better because the water got a little hotter and it definitely had more pressure, but otherwise we really like this one. I do like the eco mode on this which was why I picked this brand. The one setting prevents it from heating until you sit down so it isn't keeping water warm or even hot all the time. Very good setting. It does heat up quite quickly and is quite good at keeping the water warm until you're done. Since the pressure isnt what I was used to it just takes a little longer to wash. Overall i am glad I purchased and recommend it."
"Got this after a cold water bidet attachment began to drip.

Installation was clear and easy. If you're not super familiar with plumbing, you can do it. My only issue was making sure the hoses were not bending/angled too close to the connectors when I tightened them. (I'm a novice, I've literally only ever swapped toilet guts before this) and the nut that secured said guts to the opening at the bottom of the tank did come loose as I was adding the t joint to the tank, but again... Total rookie mistake. All told it took less than an hour and would have been quicker if I wasn't in such close quarters, or had to tighten a few connectors that leaked initially, that weren't as tight as I thought.

Heated up within minutes and seems to be solid. Any leaks I anticipate will be in the hardware already on my toilet before I installed the unit, this is very solid, and the hardware included seemed to be as well.

Don't tighten the bolts to the seat to toilet too tight until you have made sure the seat is set relative to the front edge of the bowl. I had to move the bolt brackets a little when it overhung at the front a little too much, but it was easy enough to adjust.

The unit sprays for up to 2 minutes, but you can stop using a stop button as soon as you're good.

Dryer is no great shakes, and I wasn't expecting it to be. Water flow is good and nozzles seem to hit about the right spot to give your booty a shower.

I'm a huge fan and don't ever want to use just paper ever again."
"I upgraded from a basic non-electric bidet that was higher pressure cold water that required multiple rounds of wiping after to get clean. After reading the reviews, I was worried this model's lower pressure wouldn't compare; however, it does well. I don't know if it's because the aeration is different, or maybe it's just because the water is warm, but the Brondell does a much better job despite less pressure. Don't get me wrong: the pressure is still strong. There's also a strong wash mode, but I don't need to use it.

I didn't see much mention of the eco modes. I'll copy-paste what the manual says:

""Standard Eco Mode: Press the Eco Mode until the Yellow indicator light is on for Low energy-saving, and the seat and water temperature will be heated to 89.6 F. Once a person sits on the bidet, the swash will revert to the last seat and water temperature settings used. Press the Eco Mode button until there are no indicator lights to deactivate Eco Mode.

High-Efficiency Eco Mode: Press the Eco Mode button until the Green indicator light is on for High energy-saving, and the seat and water temperature will turn off when the bidet is not in use. Once a person sits on the bidet, the Swash will revert to the last seat and water temperature settings used. Press the Eco Mode until there are no indicator lights on to deactivate Eco Mode.""

As a slow-goer, the high-efficiency mode works just right for me.

Also, hold the water pressure PLUS button for four seconds while NOT on the seat to disable the night light.

Hold the pulse button for four seconds while NOT on the seat to disable/override the sensor for sitting detection. Of note: overriding the seat sensor disable the nozzle's self-cleaning function, so turn this setting off if you want self-cleaning to work."
"I purchased this seat during the great toilet paper shortage of 2020. The seat was great until it wasn't anymore.

Sadly, the seat broke down and started leaking from the nozzle enclosure. The only way to mitigate this issue was to turn off the water supply. Clearly this is some sort of seal or other internal part of the seat that failed.

This wouldn't really be an issue if the company stood by their product. I reached out for a warranty request. Shortly after, I was asked to send the S/N along with a video of the issue.

Clearly, the video shows a fault with the seat. Bronell's solution is to charge several fees in addition to a lengthy repair process. Their reply is as follows:

Repair costs are estimated at the following rates:
Labor: $45/hour
Parts: Range from $5–$60 each
Roundtrip shipping: $35–$45, depending on your US address

Your minimum repair cost will be estimated in the $100- $150 range.

Additionally, they did offer a meager discount on their 600+ dollar seats (only purchased from their site). The only downside is that the discounts still don't come close to what I can find them for on Amazon.

The failure to accommodate your customer base when your seat is clearly at fault is the biggest shortcoming for Brondell.

Buyer beware...."
The buttons are very easy to understand. It is easy to install and works well with the spraying but it does very little for drying. The air is almost non existent. It washes you for 2 minutes and dries for 2 minutes but the air flow is very very minute. You can adjust the pressure of spray of water at the position of the sprayer but you can't do anything about the fan.
Love the bidet ... People don't realize that washing ... swishing ... the material off of your bum not just is good for you ... but is also sanitary vs wiping. Wiping sometimes ONLY smears ... whereas washing/swishing removes much of the material from you pores. And that is way healthier.
"Pretty awesome bidet with a few issues:

- it will last about 2 years before dying
- installation is annoying, threads are plastic so if you screw up there’s no fixing it
- the air blower tab freezes open basically day one so all sorts of grossness goes in there
- all the settings are basically there to make it seem like there is a ton of choices but you will only use one
- the older models water got a lot hotter this gets warm at best and only lasts a short while

If you don’t mind the price and short life span it’s a decent bidet"
I did all my homework first to make sure it had power and dimensions were correct. My husband installed it in less than 30 min and it works great. Very happy with this purchase
Bidet has been great. Next one will have a dryer
"i love this bidet, the only thing i wish was better is the drying option. Could be a little stronger blower, after 2 minutes still not dry. takes twice and then still have to wipe. other than that i love it. the pressure is ok, there are two modes for it, if you don't like the lighter one. however, being a women, the sprayer doesn't get to exactly where it needs to go, you have to adjust your body for it to hit the right spot if you know what I mean! The rear end wash is fine, but it doesn't seem to be positioned right for the women."
Worked great for 20 months but the plastic tank started leaking. Easy set up. For the price it should last longer than that.
"A few poor design decisions make it impossible for me to seriously recommend this. It's my first bidet, and I hadn't used one before, so I didn't want to throw down big bucks in case I didn't like it. That was likely a mistake, since I'm very emphatically a ""buy nice or buy twice"" person about most things.

1. The build quality is about what you would expect at this price point. It's...fine. It creaks a bit when you sit on it, but it's sturdy enough that I'm not too afraid of shattering it mid-movement.

2. The unit arrived with the spray head super misaligned, such that it soaked my right cheek rather than clean anything.

3. The warm water runs out well before a spraying cycle is complete, and warm water was the point of paying extra for this model. I assume the heating element is simply not powerful enough to keep up at this price point. The water drops in temperature rapidly until it's lukewarm. Still better than tap temperature if you live somewhere with a cold tap.

4. The dazzling blue nightlight should be optional. It's like walking into a very uneventful rave when I have to take a 3am pee.

5. The control arm, conversely, is unlit aside from the indicator LED lights, and the only button with a distinguishable texture is a single nub on the stop button. I kept a keychain flashlight by the toilet for night use while I got used to the button positions, but not before being shot in the giblets because I hit the front-wash button by accident.

6. The drier is a joke. A very smelly, bad joke. The deodorizer smells terrible. The amount of air being generated is an order of magnitude less than a hair drier, to give a comparison, and it simply doesn't dry you off. Even sitting through 2-3 cycles, you won't be dry enough to use a bit of TP without it disintegrating. I have taken to using a final towel-off, like you would with a lorta I have a lot of spare time and no vulva, so it's tolerable for me, but a person with a vulva/in a hurry will likely need a better drying solution for sanitary reasons.

TL;DR, spend more money and get a better one."
"We had the Swash SE400 for over three years. Even though we installed the Brondell in line filter and changed it out every 6 months, with our well and hard water, eventually the bidet spray wand got clogged and would not spray any longer. We used both the front and back nozzle. The front clogged first, and then we used the back. Worked for over three and a half years which isn't too bad.

After visiting our daughter in Japan, we can no longer live without one of these, so we decided to purchase the newer LT89.

We never used the dryer function so the LT89 fit the bill perfectly. Really like how it is a hybrid system and never runs out of hot water. At least for the duration of time we use it. And our water in the winter coming into the unit is extremely cold living in the mountains.

We are fans of having the controls attached to the bidet and will never buy into the complication of a battery powered remote.

We do have the spray strength set on the strongest which is just fine for us even with the variable water presssure provided by a well water system and pressure tank which varies the overall house water pressure over a 20 psi range (from 45-65).

The LT89 works perfectly for our use case and I don't see any reason to buy one of the more expensive Brondell or other brands. Highly recommended."
"I love the warm toilet seat and the warm water. We have well water and it is COLD. Brondell warms the water beautifully, and I love features that are easy to reach on side of bidet. All together, a good product.
Highly recommend."
" ""I recently purchased this item, and I was disappointed to find out that it does not have a warn air drying option as advertised. Additionally, the product listing does not have any pictures showing that some models do not have this feature. I wish I had known about this before making my purchase. While the product itself seems to be of good quality, the lack of this feature is a significant drawback for me. I hope that the seller will update their product description to be more transparent about this difference between models."""
"First off, I was resistant to getting this product, but after trying a couple different extremely expensive medications for colitis issues I've had for the past couple years (I'll spare you the details), some websites recommended trying a bidet seat to help ease some of the symptoms. I was skeptical, but the seat was a tiny fraction of the cost of the medications I had been using, so I decided to give it a go. I'll also say that my wife was also skeptical, neither of us having tried a bidet seat before. Well, after about a week, the worst of my symptoms were nearly gone, and I had gotten used to using the seat. There was a bit of screwing around that needed to be done to install it, including adding a GFCI electrical outlet by the toilet and doing some basic plumbing, like hooking up water lines. I was able to do both of those things and install the seat in about a half hour to an hour. If you're not comfortable doing those things, it would mean hiring a plumber and/or an electrician, and would take considerably longer at a much larger expense, so you'd have to weigh those costs. For a handy person, though, this is a pretty easy thing to install. Now I don't use any other bathroom in the house, and the worst of my colitis symptoms are diminished (not gone). Overall, this is a really good unit - easy to use and understand, and easy to control."
"Don’t rely on the pictures. Watch the little video. It explains in detail where gaskets and fittings go.
At 78 years old it was a real challenge to lay down between the wall and the toilet."
"This product performs well and meets nearly all of our expectations except fit. Our toilet is within the parameters for the Round Swash unit:
A - 16"" (allowed 16-17.75"")
B - 2"" (allowed >1,5"")
C - 5.25"" (allowed 5.25 - 7.45"")

The seat overhangs the front of the toilet by 1.25"", both on the inside and outside of the toilet front. (see pictures) This in spite of installing as close to the tank as was possible. This makes for a snug fit for the ""front bits"" of the male anatomy when sitting and means that the toilet rim needs to be wiped prior to sitting down, if toilet is occasionally used for standing peeing.

I have replaced the normal toilet seat twice over the years, and have never had a problem with fit... Disappointing.

That said, we love having a bidet, and the fit is but a minor annoyance."
"Had to forego the model with a fan (only on long bowl models), but that is not a big deal. This has lots of features and works well - appears better constructed than other brands with metal spout and in general. Be prepared for the next mindless run on T.P.! (hopefully not)"
"This product is amazing, especially during this time where we have to shelter in place. Since every store is pretty much out of toilet paper, that is what pushed us to finally get a bidet. We were talking about this for a long time and now that we have this, we do not know why we waited so long! You will feel cleaner after using the bathroom each time and it's eco-friendly! The cost of the bidet pays itself off considering the continuous TP you would've been buying. NOW we do not have to risk going out and catching COVID-19 and stay in long lines that is unnecessary.

My husband installed it and he said it was fairly easy. Recommend that you make sure to measure your toilet length to make sure it fits from front of the toilet tank to the front of your toilet bowl, and the 2 toilet seat knobs on the bottom of the unit, when toilet seat is lowered, sit and align nicely on top of your toilet bowl. You'll likely need to slide the unit into the toilet bidet seat brackets and reposition a couple of times to make sure the fit is the way you want. Also make sure that you don't over tighten your t-bar water pipe connectors under your toilet tank, as we did, and the rubber washer that was sitting in between the t-bar and the toilet tank was sucked into the connection causing a leak. If so, you'll need to shut off the water and drain the tank, then remove the connection and the sucked in rubber washer to re-seat your pipe fittings and check for leaks again when the water is turned back on. Those were the most complex installation tasks but the rest is really easy and about 30-60 minutes from start to finish."
"Love it. As with everyone else, since idiots are buying out toilet paper (why? Do you plan to go more than normal?), I decided to ""splurge"" and buy a bidet seat. I always wanted to get one, but I just never had the funds lol. I only got one, but dangit, should've bought TWO because it has sold out... Everyone getting the same idea. I wasn't sure how my Autistic 9 year old would take to it as he also has Sensory Processing Disorder. At first he was weirded out, but then tried it again, and now he says, ""I wish I could poop so I can use it again!"" 😅😅😅😅

I was worried about exactly how CLEAN it leaves you, and I was worried for nothing. I mean, it got EVERYTHING.

I had some trouble installing it, only that I kept feeling water by the t-valve, but not a heavy leak... Almost like somebody just walked by and shook their wet hands by it. Fiddled and fiddled with the connection, and it finally seems to be dry. You may wanna get that white tape stuff just in case. Overall, we love it. No complaints! So easy to install.

My bathroom's plug is nowhere near the toilet, but I used a heavy duty power strip to a GFCI outlet, which the maintenance guy said was okay, just don't plug anything else in it (although I accidentally forgot and plugged in my toothbrush. He said it probably wasn't strong enough to do any damage, but I will find a new outlet for it).

I will try to come back and update on its longevity.
But already I'm excited for restock so I can get another one!"
"This bidet works well. It’s not the fanciest but I was limited because I needed a round one instead of elongated. It takes a little longer than my Toto to go to a different function but only by a couple of seconds. I really like the light that stays on. I wish my Toto had that feature. All in all, good value for the money"
"Never going back, everyone should get a bidet, this one was in my price range and I don't know how it could get any better after using it for the first week. It's strong, reliable, and works like a charm. I feel so good after using it, that I feel I could get in any argument and win because I know my behind is cleaner than the peasant I'm dealing with, ha ha. I jest. Even though this was not the most expensive on the market, I'd go for it. There's no way it can get better quality for the price. Stop shopping and add to cart."
"Easy to install, comfortable, seems to be very well made, and plenty of features."
I am an avid supporter of the bidet. I have had numerous ones over the years and when I recently moved I wanted a step up and I certainly got it. This bidet has all the bells and whistles and keeps itself clean. I have had no problems and plan on getting a second one for the guest bathroom soon
"First off, I have to say, this thing cleans really, really well. Just line up the nozzle, press Rear twice, then press Pulse, and wait. That's where the positives end.

Brondell, fix your fit measurements. Maybe take an inch off of them at the very least, but even that doesn't account for the fact that the nozzle assembly prevents you from pushing the bidet back as far as it SHOULD go on your toilet. You can try purchasing some toilet seat bumpers to put between the mounting bracket and the rest of the bidet, but people with round toilets that barely meet the ""required"" measurements will still end up with the front of the rim of the bowl being exposed behind the front rim of the bidet.

Also, why do Bio Bidet, Brondell and Toto (and others, I'm sure) all use a similar mounting bracket. These brackets are unintuitive and overengineered, and it seems like each company has a different idea as to when in the installation process you should connect the bracket to the toilet and when you should connect the bracket to the bidet. It's really strange.

Anyway, this is a great bidet if it fits your toilet, but people with toilets that barely meet the size requirements suggested by Brondell shouldn't get their hopes up."
"I currently own a different Brondell model for several years now that seems to have been replaced by this one. Same features for the most part, same price. The only difference is that this one does a better job of heating the water and it sounds like there’s an ‘80s space arcade game going on under my butt (the other model is much quieter)! I think it’s hilarious but my wife is less amused. Not sure if this is the case with this model in general, but everything is functional so I’ll just deal with it for now. No complaints otherwise, but we’ll see how it holds up."
"So Bidet's in general amazing. Warm water bidet next level. This does water on demand in eco mode and it is amazing because well it takes time to poop so you sit down and then it starts to heat more. Keeps some water heated but man oh man. I used to love to poop on company time. Never again. The air dryer is useless to me. Some women around have said okay it is nice. It is a bathroom, I dry up with some TP, a non issue for me. I haven't tried every unit out there but the controls are good, heater is good, heated seat works, I don't need a heated seat but super easy to use the controls on the side. If you are this far along in the review seriously order it. I am replacing my toilet now and my one problem is the round bowl is to slightly to small. It is fine and works and is close to the edge but if I had to do it over again I would have replaced the toilet first to get the elongated bowl, I still might just get a different elongated one but love this product. Had it to do over again no air dry for me."
"So the good news- it works, the water gets warm but the real dealbreaker with this seat is that it doesn't get very warm. Nothing like a cold toilet seat in the AM to wake up up; granted, this one's not ice cold but it definitely doesn't get as warm as the older Brondell we replaced.

We opted to buy this cheaper model, as there's many features on the older one we replaced that we don't need. Like the blow dryer. We didn't realize that by going with less features that the other more desirable features would take a hit.

I would recommend spending $50 more and getting a better model than this one. If we could return it, we would. But we're gonna move it to the guest bathroom and order a different model."
"Changing from using a ""Genia Bedie' (i.e., a cold water device) to the ""Brondell LE89 Swash Electronic Bidet Seat LE89"" was somthing I should have done sooner. Although the instalatons of the two devices are simular, the confort level of the Brondell far exceeds the Genia. This Electronic Bidet is at such a reasonable price, it should be anyone's first first choice. Of couse the Brondell requires an electrical plugin, but I found that a relatively short extenaion cord easily solved that problem."
"After many hours of searching bidet toilet seats, I decided on this Brondell. I thought I read through all the reviews and checked all the important info but upon receiving my toilet seat, I found that I needed additional parts to install because my water line is ""concealed"" at the toilet tank. Also, because I have a top mount toilet seat, I needed another set of additional parts. So, after visiting their website directly to order parts, paying an additional $25 in said parts and waiting for another week, I finally could install my seat. Come to find out, I only needed a couple washers for the top mount toilet seat because the bolt I purchased were too small but the valve kit worked and fit perfectly. Installation was less than 20 mins. very fast and easy with the right parts! So far I love the seat and all the options. I do wish the seat heater was on a pressure sensor, instead of just constantly being ""on"" and if they just threw in a couple washers to help fit top mount seats it would be nice but otherwise, very happy with my purchase!"
"Controls were difficult to get to---had to feel the buttons, then learn what each did. Another model had. TV-like remote I wish I had splurged for. Same with the air dryer. Sometimes the cleaning is 100% but half the time there is 1 to 5% I still find on the TP. My wife is hampered by the after effects of a long COVID-19 hospitalization and it helps her a lot. Plummets were over to fix a leak so I had them install it. They ended up weaking a fitting in the bathroom pipes that created a leak they had to come back and fix, so be aware that even so-called professional may cause unexpected problems, especially in an older house."
Should of got this year's ago
The first bidet I purchased was a different brand and just wouldn’t work right so I replaced it with this one and I am so glad I did. This one works like a charm. This one was easier to install. I haven’t had to unplug it and re-plug it in even once to get it to work again. If I had to have one complaint I wish the cord were 3” longer. That’s it.
"I purchased and installed this in advance of rotator cuff surgery. Being able to get thoroughly clean when you don’t have full range of motion of your arm is a lifesaver! I’m planning to get a second one for our guest bathroom. The only tricky part is installing an electrical outlet near the toilet if you don’t have one. Fortunately, I was able to install an electrical outlet myself. You may need to hire an electrician if you’re not comfortable with electrical DIY."
It may be better for Brondell to label their models differently. When I read the advertisement and product summary for the 89 series I did not realize the 89lt was different than the 89ls in the way of the dryer being included in one and not the other 89 Lt . I would believe these modes would be advertised as a separate product and not together. Maybe it's me but they could have made a larger effort to reflect the differences than brackets in the manual. Also product uses more electrical watts than I would have assumed it should. This is my third installation of a brondell swash but this one disappoints me unlike the others.
"I love this product, I’ve used other brands and was never able to find one like Brondell the toilet seat top is so strong compare to others definitely recommended it has a great quality for a great price"
This thing works great I have two friends that have never tried it and they are sold move to a place where the plumbing sucks so I decided to put one in and I'm happy that I did I don't know why America doesn't have more
"Seems good for the price, first one I have ever used though.

Definitely get one with an arm that moves up if you only have one bathroom and there are men use in the house. ;-) Otherwise use this in the 2nd bathroom for #2s and/or women only.

The seam on the seat is not perfect, seems a bit cheap considering the price of the unit.

Not sure if just my setup, but seat doesn't seem to be exactly level, as one side will move to touch the bowl when you sit down.

Used thread tape and a short extension cord found on Amazon to finish the installation. Something also to think about is where your power is, you may find a seat that has power on the side of the seat which works better for you."
"So far, very happy I did! Has the same features. Granted, I just installed it today. It was super easy! Everything is working great so far! Light does seem to stay on constantly. Not a problem as my toilet is in its own little room. Could be that it’s never very bright in there."
"The warm seat and water are very soothing. The noises and delay between modes are a little annoying, but it's a nice luxury."
"Water pressure is not that strong, the light only gos on when the bathroom light gos on and the washing wand gos in and out plus it beeps when I turn on the light. I don’t know if it’s supposed to do that. Can anyone tell me if it’s normal?"
"This was very easy to install. Has more bells and whistles than you would expect. Only drawback is that the front spray doesn’t really get the front if you are a female. Just sprays a little more forward than the back spray. Make sure you hook up the hot water though, if it is all cold, it is a frigid shock and that is not an area for a frigid shock."
"I recently purchased this product and I absolutely love it. The installation instruction video is very clear and true. Very easy to use and comfortable! It also fits any type of toilet. In my case I have a round toilet, got the elongated bidet and it fits perfectly. Highly recommended!!"
Cleaning my tush
"Please don't fall for those cheap cold butt-blasters online! Get one of these instead! You'll wonder how you lived without one for so long. Seat warmer is great, nozzle adjustments, water pressure and water temp settings get you dialed in perfectly. The blue light is great in the middle of the night, illuminates the bowl without being a distraction (I still use a nightlight). I use eco mode though it draws little power. The air dryer is a bit weak for my tastes though otherwise superb and worth the expense. Also, I don't have to worry about those crazy TP hoarders! Installation was super easy, no tools needed. Well pleased with the results."
"After a bit of research I chose this brand. It's a great combination of features, reviews, customer service and price. It has more features than what I wanted, but to get a small amount of warmed water to wash with I chose the combination type of heating systems. I really never use the heated seat or drying features.
Only complaint I have is minor, the water jets are off center! Hmm, first world problem for sure."
"Wow! Not sure why these aren't used more. Took a pandemic to bring these to my families attention and the lack of toilet paper availability. 3 out of 4 family members immediately enjoyed this item and found it wonderful, full of options, very thorough, leaving a much fresher feeling instead of normal toilet paper (only) practices. Almost something to look forward to...I have told numerous friends about this product and will continue to spread the news. After one or two uses, ordered another one for our 2nd bathroom. Looking forward to the elongated model that comes with the dryer. The first one was for a round toilet and didn't have the dryer. Luckily I was able to install an outlet for it, but if you have a plug (GFCI) in your bathroom already, you can easily just run an extension cord, its worth it."
"I have just installed the Brondell LT89 Swash Electronic Bidet and had a bit of trouble with the washer at the top of the T-valve. The diagram shows it in the wrong direction, so it leaked once I turned the water on. At this point I had mildly tightened it, and the rubber washer was wedged into the bottom of the toilet fitting. I examined the fitting and realized the diagram was wrong so I flipped the rubber washer, tightened the fitting more than the previous time, and it still leaked. Next, I added Teflon tape, tightened as much as I thought was safe and it persisted to leak! Finally, I watched the video and realized that I might be tightening it too much. I lightly tightened the fittings and now no leaks! Everything else works great so far but be careful with the water connections."
"I am pretty happy with the bidet seat - especially the heated seat feature. The water pressure is really strong, but I guess that's what you want!

The only thing I've been unhappy with is the blue light feature. I can't sleep if there are any lights on and the toilet room in the master bathroom is visible from our bed. So every night I wake up to see what the blue light glow is, coming out from under the door.

Yesterday I just started randomly holding down buttons on the remote and the ""stop"" button turned off the light! Finally after 2 months! I had the best sleep last night."
"I’ve wanted a bidet for years. Did a bunch of research before I chose this one. All the great reviews are right on target! I love, love, love this. It was super easy to install; I did it myself in 15 minutes by following along with the video on their website. Only tool needed was a screwdriver to remove my existing seat. I love that the nozzle position, pressure and heat are all adjustable. And the heated seat alone is worth it during this cold Midwestern winter. Can’t recommend this highly enough. Before you buy, just measure where your bolts are on your current seat, and your seat length. Then compare with their handy chart so you know which one to buy. Easy peasy!"
"I didn't want to buy the most expensive model given I wasn't sure if this bidet thing would work . After a month of using it, I would be happy to give 5 stars. I also purposely chose a model without a dryer. Anything that is close to water needs to be kept simple. Having all the fancy features mean you have more points of failure which isn't always best place to repair. Also, I have read that the air dryer does not work well enough most people end up using towels. Anyways, that is a personal choice but as far as this specific model is concerned, I have zero regret and would highly recommend to everyone."
This seat works great. I'm very happy I got it. The warm water and the seat warmer by the sensor on the seat it perfet
"I have been wanting one of these for awhile, and I finally decided on this one. It took me all of 10 minutes to install - and I love this thing. The heated seat and heated water are amazing. I opted for the model without the dryer, as I have used models with dryers before, and none of them were very effective - you have to pat dry anyway. I am thrilled with my purchase, and very glad I got a model with all the features I wanted for a good price.

Update: Almost a year later, and I still love this! I can’t imagine not having it now. It still works great - no problems at all, and I’ve saved on TP. Thanks for a great product!"
"I'm not a normal reviewer...but had to do so for this product. The ONLY con is it doesn't quite cover the whole bowl perimeter but that's my odd toilet.
The seat was extremely easy to install--less than an hour. It is a dream to use, too! Every feature is amazing. The location of the buttons and the use is intuitive and easy to learn.
You get warm water WITHOUT hooking to your warm water supply. It's fully functional after connecting to the toilet water supply and and plugging into an electric outlet.
I am in LOVE with this bidet!!"
"It doesn’t fit on the bowl right. It doesn’t go far enough back. The back of the bidet hits the tank while the front overhangs the bowl and my thingy touches porcelain. It doesn’t wash well either. It’s also noisy. My advice would be to get an elongated toilet and get the Bondell Swash 400. I have 2 in my Hawaii home and I love them. This model, not so much!"
"I am enjoying using this bidet

I kind of wish it had a hand remote or a remote that could stick on wall

It’s a little loud so I don’t use overnight in case it should wake up my hubby

I live the warm seat and water.

Overall I’m happy"
From the moment the bidet arrived he water heater did not work at all. I was too busy with work to do anything about returning. It's too bad the used product quality has plummeted as of late. I never had so many problems.
"Everyone should own one of these. Save on TP and get your bottom cleaner. This is the second one that I have purchased, and I don’t regret either one. We rarely use TP anymore. Make sure you buy the model with the air dryer. You’ll thank me later. When I lived in Ohio, the heated seat was the bomb!, plus heated water. Now that I’m in Florida, I don’t need that so much, but I just turn that feature down."
"Bidets are great but I regret buying this one. The stream doesn’t angle where it needs to go. You have to angle yourself to it, which creates issues. Buy a different brand."
"Amazon did not list correct information about this product. Listing says that it has a warm air feature, it does not ! Going to have to order a different higher priced model."
"First off the seat seems to be of quality construction. It was very easy to install and having the included T fitting for the water hookup was great.

However, be careful you are selecting the right unit as they use the LE description for the LT model.

As a result unlike the description this unit DOES NOT include a dry function as stated in the description. Per the manual that feature is only in the LE

Second: from the description it sounds like the pulse function oscillates the nossel. Maybe i just read it wrong but it does not, this mode just raises and lowers then water pressure.

I probably should have gotten a different model, if the description was accurate I probably would have."
"Never used a bidet in the past. After witnessing the stores sell out of toilet paper for the second time during the pandemic, and people buying enough toilet paper to last a family of 4 at least 2 years, I was sick of this nonsense. Bought the brondell le89 and installed it the same day, best investment ever. Even when this is over and people are giving away their lifetime supply of toilet paper I will not go back. Only complaint is you can not sit on the lid. Easy to install, easy to use."
"This thing is awesome! I love the warm water, the pressure is great and adjustable. We turned off the blue light because it is so bright. It is easy to turn off, just hold down on the stop button for 4 seconds and it will beep. I read the directions. It's my go-to if all else fails.

In all seriousness, this is amazing. I'm glad I bit the bullet and went with electric. Right now it is on an extension cord until hubby puts in the switch which will happen this weekend. We both now are sparring over who gets to go to the bathroom first!!!"
"On that note, this product is pretty much the final nail in the coffin of toilet paper shortages. Of course keeping some beside the toilet is a must, but mostly for light drying and guests afraid or uncomfortable using our the toilet now. After a little instruction before hand, we've had 100% success of opening minds to the practically of a bidet generally speaking. Can't say enough, every function works flawlessly when used correctly and will purchase another soon for our other bathroom."
"It's way too weak on the regular setting, and the strong setting is a single strong stream, which is uncomfortable, kinda like a needle hitting your ass. I think this thing is causing me pain and itching, and I'm going to replace it."
"Great for cleaning, not great for drying. The description seems to indicate being able program for multiple user settings, this is not the case, at least for this model. Adjustable seat, water, and air heat is nice, but you'll still need to use a few squares of tp to dry your nether regions, unless you have about 40 minutes to sit and wait for a very gentle breeze to help evaporate the water."
I thought I was getting the dryer with my model. Very confusing. When I click on elongated model it defaults to this style number which doesn’t come with a dryer only the round does??? Kind of a bummer. I was looking forward to that:( otherwise everything else is very satisfactory
I’ve wanted one of these Bidets for a long time! And wow am I stoked! The past few days have been slow while staying home due to the virus. I was so happy as I watched from my second story window the mailman drop off my Brondell package. I began the install by spraying disinfectant all over the box and my toilet. Mounting the bidet took less than 10 minutes. This model has everything I ever wanted including the heated seat and water. Can’t beat the price on this unit. Highly recommend for anyone with a smaller toilet like mine!
The nut is fragile plastic.
"The only feature that I enjoyed about this bidet was the warm water. None of the other features are done well. The night light is blue which wakes me up. I think a red light would have worked much better. The fan doesn't really work well.

Almost a year after we purchased this bidet, we started hearing a loud noise that we later learned was a water hammer. Right after the warranty ran out the bidet stopped working.

I think you should either save money and get a bidet under $50 or go premium and get something top of the line."
"I really like this product! Would totally recommend it to anyone!
Love it!"
"The bidet was originally great, but after the first year the rim broke which caused the heated seat to quit working. Then yesterday, the lid broke and now just drops freely instead of lowering safely. So 2 1/2 years…"
"This model does NOT have a dryer, the description is incorrect. Model LE89 is the correct one with dryer. CSU has been updated."
First time ever writing a review...if you are even remotely thinking about buying a bidet..JUST DO IT! We decided on the Brondell LT89 and so far WE LOVE IT! This thing is AWESOME! Heated seat..woo hoo! Warm water..sooo NICE! Dryer..yep dries that tush! Night light..stainless nozzle..this thing has all the bells and whistles! So we are sooo glad we got this..and believe me you will too! There are less expensive ones out there..yes..but we wanted all these features and they are so worth it..hate we didn't get it sooner!
"LOVE my new bidet! What has taken us so long to start using them. This one was super simple to install, less than 20 minutes. Has every option you could want with easily understood controls. Seems extremely well made - very solid materials. One of the few on the market rated to sit on the lid. Plenty of pressure, have never run out of warm water. Dryer actually directed where it is needed, doesn't dry completely, but none do. Highly recommended."
"I don't like giving reviews but this product is a must!!! WE have had it now since December of 2020 and it is wonderful. Wish I could give all my loved ones one for a gift, but maybe they will catch on soon."
Wish i read closer before i bought because i got one without heated air dryer.
"I bought this bidet seat because I'm having surgery on both wrists soon and did not want someone taking care of my bathroom business for me.... I am now a fan! This model was a good compromise between features and value and I am very happy with my purchase. Clean and fresh, indeed!"
"So glad I got this bidet. I had it professionally installed because I got one before that I installed but installation was not successful. It leaked. I returned that one and got another one
It is absolutely wonderful. I am glad I did not waste my time and sweat to install it this time!
No air dryer though but it is wonderful! I am looking to buy 1 or 2 more! It really is very good!"
I got this from my husband’s birthday present lol I know it sounds silly but it’s probably the best thing I ever bought him
We liked the first one that we bought over a year ago that we added this one to the master bathroom in our vacation home. It was easy to install and works as expected. I do wish that the control arm was somewhat further away from the toilet. For someone very heavy they will have difficulty dealing with the control arm.
"The installation was easy, the product fit and the product uses quality materials and design.
The problem i have with it is it does not seem to work as advertised. The water pressure from is not sufficient to do the job. I've tried using various but still not working well. I've left tickets on the support site asking for suggestions but have not revived a reply

I have another one, the simpler non-electric version, and that one works well, much simpler, although i'm having pdifficulties with that one also as the nozzel does not retract and i have to give it a slight tape to have it auto retract. Bummer, but the water pressure on that one is sufficient. I've also left tickets on their support site about this with no response.

I like the idea, but the execution seems to be not the best. i don't regret buy the simple one ( if i can get it fixed) but i do regret getting this one.

S"
Nozzle leaked water after day 3 and water pressure got really low
Everything working per designed . Blue LED Looks great at night. I have used it only one month and will update in about one year!!
"Initially liked this product very much, as it greatly reduced the amount of TP we used. However, 3 months in, the seat cracked. Took 3 weeks to get customer service to respond. They had me ship the product back and took 2 months for repair (bought a new seat as an interim). Finally received the repaired product—minus the hoses and connectors I shipped back to them. So another 2 week delay before re-installing the seat. Got another 2 months of operation out of it before it stopped spraying entirely. None of the troubleshooting steps on the site worked. Some chat boards suggest they are prone to bad control boards. Have filed two separate support requests and no response (like last time). SAVE YOUR MONEY. Try another brand."
Use plumbers tape on all threaded attachments
"I'm 78 yrs old and installed my LT89 in 15 minutes with no leaks.
Fabulous!!"
"Liking it so far. Wasn’t too hard to install. Seems to hold up pretty good so far. It’s hard to get used to going back to TP after using it lol. About only complaint or suggestions would be to add a night light turn off option. I know it doesn’t take up a lot of electricity, but bathroom is connected to bedroom so have to keep door closed to shut out the light."
"Super easy to install, super easy to use and does exactly what is advertised. I cant ask for anything better"
"The Toto ones I used in japan cost up to $5,000 and I simply could not afford one upon my return. But now at this price I have one. Not quite a Toto, but still very suitable at this price. Once you get used to this you can never go back so beware."
Ease of install. Dryer-ability to regulate h2o temp and pressure. Permanent nite lite great.
"Easy to install. The movie helps me install this.
I used similar product in Japan. This one is working good.
Be sure the size is okay for your toilet.
I recommend this product for this people who are considering similar products."
"I live in the UP of Michigan and after being outside during the winter and using the toilet, nothing beats a bun warmer."
"It's a great product except that the front wash is way too far back for ladies. I'd read this in reviews but thought to try it myself... will have to return and try another. Otherwise very solid, easy to install, easy to use. If Brondell made a version with more reasonable front wash, I would definitely choose that, but I don't know if one under $600."
Every time you use the ladies room you can refresh with so easy. All of my guests just loves it! Best $250 I've every spent!
"I really wanted to love this bidet but it doesn’t work 90% of the time. When it works it’s great but I had to stop and restart it about 10 times. I gave this about 30 days to see if it would get better but it didn’t. the nozzle either won’t extend all the way, causing water to spray and make a mess at the back of the seat, or if it does extend, it doesn’t retract when you’re done leaving the nozzle exposed which is unsanitary. I returned this product and purchased a different brand I had success with in the past."
"This bidet is exceptionally well engineered, constructed, and documented. It is a great value at $85. It looks sleek and modern. The single-knob control provides precisely adjustable flow to one of two spray nozzles. Rotating it backward controls one nozzle. Rotating it forward controls the other. Water pressure causes one of the nozzles to extend from its normally-retracted position (out of harms way). Installation was simple and straightforward. The absence of warm water takes a little getting accustomed to, and some might say refreshing. As others have said, upgrading to a slow-close lid alone would cost at least $45. Getting a full bidet for $40 more is amazing."
"I had been contemplating purchasing a bidet seat for quite some time mostly due to physical limitations, but I’d also experienced them many years ago throughout Europe, and appreciated the efficiency.
With the purchase of a new home that has a ridiculously cramped en-suite bathroom between two bedrooms, and a toilet that is low enough to the ground to be suitable for a Lilipution, it was time.
This bathroom will be completely remodeled some time in the future, but for now it just needed to be made functional without having to smash elbows into walls, etc.
After a great deal of research it came down to this unit mostly because it was the only one that would fit and still allow the toilet seat to remain open on its own. There were a few electric units that might have worked but that would’ve entailed installing electrical access, which will be part if the remodel eventually.
SO... I went for it. The price was too good to pass up, and delivery was free and very quick. I received it before Christmas but today was the first time everything aligned to allow me to install. For me personally the installation took about an hour, but that is strictly a reflection of my physical capabilities (and OCD), the minimal space configuration of my bathroom, and the necessity of searching around for a crescent wrench to tighten the packing nut on the shut off valve that was loosened up a bit in the process of the installation. All things considered, this installation was a piece of cake and under normal circumstances would’ve been accomplished in under 20 minutes. I literally only required a flathead screwdriver to remove the old toilet seat, and the wrench to tighten the shut off nut. The seat itself installed effortlessly with only finger tightening of all the connections. The only disappointment with the install was my toilet itself... one of the bolt holes is slightly skewed, therefore the seat is ever so slightly skewed, but not to the point of impacting functionality in any way.
After the installation I attempted to check the function and discovered that turning the control knob just a fraction will activate the self cleaning wand function, which amounts to the water pouring out through the small and housing, straight down into the toilet. I thought that the wands were malfunctioning since they didn’t pop out, so i checked to make sure the shut off valve was completely open to allow maximum water pressure. Tried it again, same thing. Then I turned the knob a little bit further...HELLO!! A word of warning, if you are not going to sit on the seat to test it out, I HIGHLY recommend wrapping your bowl opening with plastic wrap as those little wands will shoot water a couple of feet out of the toilet (in this instance drenching the front of my clothes) otherwise. After taking it for a true ‘test drive’ I will say that the water pressure is going to be a little tricky to get dialed in, to avoid an overly aggressive experience, but the ambient water temperature is not uncomfortable at all. “Positioning” is also going to be a little learning curve, as water can spray back or overshoot onto the toilet seat, if you shift just right.
All in all, I am very happy with this purchase. It’s an excellent price for a very useful piece of equipment that I think everyone should have in their home.
Also, the lid is a bonus in two respects.. it is soft close, and it is sturdy. It’s plastic, but not at all flimsy. I don’t know if I’d try standing on it, but you can absolutely sit on it without it buckling, bending or sliding."
"Pros: very easy to install. The dial looks nice and feels sturdy. The jet hits the right spot and varies from a soft stream to very strong stream. It is very adjustable when installing. The seat is comfortable, but a little thicker or wider than normal toilet seats, so it is a slightly less compatible fit for a big guy. In general I, my girlfriend, and son all very much like it.

Cons: I can't quite get a tight enough fit install, so the seat slides a tiny bit. I move as quickly as possible past the self-cleaning feature because it splashes the butt and the seat, and the seat is wet when I'm done."
"I was worried that it was going to be flimsy like other reviews said but it is actually pretty solid. Also it doesn't shift when sitting on it, easy to remove, clean, and install. Thinking of buying another one to replace the cheap attach bidet in the other restroom."
"One of the few things my husband had to install where I didn't hear any swear words LOL! Very easy to install. Nice that it has back and front wash. Just be aware there is no temperature control so there's an initial ""wow that's cold"" feeling but then it feels refreshing. Will definitely save us $$ on toilet paper!"
"Brondell Ecoseat model 101 - elongated

This model replaced a Genie Bidet [ELONGATED] Self Cleaning Dual Nozzle installed in 2017. That Genie has several “issues”:

- one of the two nozzles stopped working

- the seat was uncomfortable after only a few minutes. The rear of the seat was higher than the front, so you lean forward slightly -- and the sitting area sides were obviously narrower than normal.

- you couldn’t lean back on the seat back because it had a sharp ridge.

- the Genie seat front was nearly 1"" from the front toilet edge.

...

The Brondell Ecoseat 101 has none of those problems.

Pros:

- the nozzles exterior is automatically rinsed when the dial is first turned.

- both nozzles are correctly aimed and the cleaning action is effective.

- the Brondell seat is level; the seating area sides are normal width; and it’s as comfortable for long periods as is a standard non-bidet seat.

- the seat top looks appears as any good quality seat top and lowers itself slowly.

- the control is a non-obtrusive dial. Off is in the middle.

- the supplied stainless steel braided water hose, although far too long at 30"", is high quality. I’m confident that it won’t burst and flood the bathroom.

Cons:

- The supplied tee fitting is stainless steel, high quality, and would be fine if was to be attached to a brass, bronze, or stainless 7/8"" pipe from the toilet tank. However, if attached to the 7/8"" plastic pipe at the bottom of most toilet tanks, it “grabs” only a few threads before bottoming out; which could strip or weaken those plastic threads when tightened.

Instead of that tee, I installed a Bidet Valve (search on Amazon) with a plastic nut that grabs7 threads of a 7/8"" pipe. That valve also has a lever which can shut off water to the bidet while leaving it on for the toilet (for bidet maintenance). No stars were taken off for the tee since I had planned to use a bidet valve from the outset.

Other:

- Turn the dial clockwise for one cleaning nozzle choice and the other way for the other cleaning nozzle. When you first turn the dial in either direction, water flows over the nozzles to clean them; next all water is routed to that nozzle, first slowly, then with force as you turn the dial all the way. I.e., you can control the water’s force by how far the knob is turned.

Water pressure can also be lowered by installing a bidet valve where the water connects to the toilet and opening it partially, installing a pressure regulator on your main water line and setting it to 60 psi, or, lowering the pressure to 60 psi on the regulator you already have.

- Bidet’s with a lever to control water to the nozzles might be tripped by a dog or cat when you’re not there, flooding your bathroom. Bidet’s with a round knob, such as the Brondell, don’t have that risk.

- The supplied 30"" stainless steel braided hose has 3/8"" female compression fittings (3/8"" comp) at both ends; a 5/8"" open end wrench fits the nuts. 3/8"" comp is a different size than 3/8"" flare fittings and different than 3/8"" NPT (National Pipe Thread) – i.e., the threads and diameter are different. Most bath and kitchen faucets use 3/8"" comp or 1/2"" comp fitting. The Brondell web site sells “replacement hoses” – select “Swash S101/102"".

- I was unable to find a shorter supply hose with a 90 degree elbow. Brondell should sell shorter supply hoses or at least a 3/8"" elbow to attach to the bidet so that standard hoses could be used.

- After-market bidets are available with dual (cold and hot) water inlets and temperature control or you can get a mixing valve to temper a cold water-only supply. Neither is practical unless your hot water heater is fairly close to the bidet, since otherwise it would take too long for hot water to get there. Actually, you get used to having unheated water spraying on your backside – it isn’t an issue once you get used to it.

- The seat opening is 11"" front to back (same as the Genie Bidet), versus 12"" for a standard elongated seat. (Side to side opening is about the same, 8"".) That doesn’t sound like much of a difference, but it’s noticeable, at least at first. If you want the largest possible seat opening, consider bidet’s that mount under an existing seat.

- As with any product, if there is some defect, return it. E.g., some reviewers complain about the nozzle’s poor aim. Since they aren’t adjustable, send it back. Also, it is possible that too low a water pressure (if your home pressure otherwise, is OK) could be the result of a defect in the bidet’s water control valve; so return it if this happens.

Install it right away, so you don’t miss the return window if there’s something wrong.

Summary:

The Model 101 is a solid choice for an after-market bidet, and it’s a significant step up from the Genie Bidet."
"The only dislike was how long it took Amazon to ship out a used, like-new product which was the only one in stock. Three weeks is ridiculous. It was well worth the price, though it was $25 more than the brand new restock units.

Amazon has been honest about its used, like new inventory. I’ve bought two items described as such and they bother were truly like-new. Every part of the bidet was still packeted in the unopened internal plastic bags. The original box was a little tattered, but an effort was made to ensure it safely arrived.

The install was a snap; 30 minutes. The finished work looks better that the original connections. Care was taken to use the meager amount of Teflon tape that came with the it. All connections were hand tightened then snugged up with a minimum of force. When the cutoff valve was reopened it sat for awhile just checking for leaks, and not a drop escaped. It’s been a few weeks now and everything function perfectly and still the joints are dry.

The bidet controls allow for some adjustment for water pressure, and the dual wands are right on target. The selection dial for the area to cleanse is obvious. Roll the dial counter clockwise for men, clockwise for women. Turning in each direction there is a midpoint that runs a cleaning cycle. It engages both as the wand is deployed and returned to off. There is an index that the user can feel as the control is rotated.

There is nothing about this bidet that’s looks or feels cheap. The directions could be clearer about the installation of the toilet seat mount plate. The info is there, but one diagram seemed out of sequence.

This bidet is highly recommend. Yeah, it is the only one I’ve ever used, but it isn’t like there is a learning curve.

Enjoy."
"The bidet was easy to install and is simple to operate. I would give it a 4/5 on most days, but there is one flaw that really annoys me. I live with my wife, she uses he toilet with the toilet seat down and I stand to do number 1 with the toilet seat up.

As you can see in the picture, we are missing one of the little pads that are connected to the bottom of the seat and rest on the toilet when the seat is down. It seems that in the night when I went to go to the bathroom I lifted the seat, did my business, flushed and went back to bed all with the lights very dim.

The next morning I went to the bathroom and noticed one of the pads is missing and no where to be found. Only plausible explanation is that it fell into the toilet when I lifted the seat and I flushed it.

I get having removable pads, you may need to install thicker ones based on your toilet, but please make them harder to fall out. I may now have a plumbing issue because of this. I understand that I should pay attention more, but come on, who is avidly diligent while pissing in the middle of the night. I shouldn’t have to add that to things I worry about."
"I have a total of 3 of these guys, 2 S101's and an S102 (in my bathroom) and I want to get one for the office too. When I first decided to try a bidet I went cheap and got one of those $30 units that slips between the seat and the bowl but I felt like I was gonna snap the handle/valve arm off and it was hard to keep in alignment with the seat, by contrast these sprayers are part of the seat assembly so they always stay in the same relative position with the seat.

When I bought my first one of these (the first S101) I was thinking, my water isn't that cold, no reason to spend the extra 30-40 bucks for the hot water version (S102) and that is technically true, most domestic cold water temps are fine and I used it for a couple months just fine, then I decided to splurge when the 102 came back in stock cause I needed a 3rd seat to complete the conversion of the whole house to bidet seats, I swapped the 102 seat in in place of the 101 and ran the included hot water tap to the bathroom sink and before using I run the sink till it's spitting out hot water, then shut off the sink and use the bidet, the warm water is so much better, I highly recommend it.

I also HIGHLY recommend using a bidet in general for people who suffer from illness's like IBS and Chrons that has you going #2 a lot, the chronic use of toilet paper those illness's bring on can have your anus inflamed (think your nose after blowing it constantly when you have a cold but it's your anus instead of your nose), once you learn how to shift your upper body so the sprayer gets everywhere it needs to (especially when you have those diarrhea sprays) all you need toilet paper for is to pat dry and thats really the only complaint, the spray pattern is so narrow (which it needs to be to have the pressure to clean) that you gotta learn how to rotate your upper body in a circular motion so the sprayer can wash the inner cheeks and the other areas of the buttocks that can be in need of cleaning, once you got that down you'll usually get clean.

Also, it's a pretty comfortable toilet seat in general, so if you are looking to replace an uncomfortable seat, you should definitely check this out on that merit alone, a comfortable seat that has soft close seat and lid is already approaching the price point of this unit.

Only other thing I would mention, if you have one of those fancy smooth sided toilets (where the mounting bolts are hidden) it can be tricky to attach the cold water T connection to the bottom of the tank, there are companies that make a short 6"" extension for the cold water on the tank, I suggest buying that, it makes it easier."
"Wow this is an awesome product.

Please tell me why we are all still using tp in 2024? It's funny how we learn to think something is normal but smearing poo on your butt and not washing it off with water is really gross. I warn you. If you buy this product and try it, you will never be comfortable using the restroom anywhere but your home.

I have bought four of these style of seat bidets recently ranging from $90 to $500. This Brondell was the best of all of them at $90. No frills. No hot water. Cleans very well and has a much more powerful cleaning stream than any of the plug-in heated bidets. It has a side knob control that works well and you can turn it slowly and gradually increase pressure. If you crank that knob up all the way you better mean it! Very solid compared to two other BioBidets and another $300 Brondell.

Buy it. Theres a reason why it is numero uno."
"The hose that is provided that goes from the water supply tee to the side of the bidet is plenty long. In most photos I have seen of other installations I did not like the excess hose extending out and beside the toilet. When I installed mine, I kept the bidet tee loose and I installed the bidet hose so that it remained close to the side of the toilet and the excess loops behind the toilet and thus it remains out of sight. (see photos). I assembled the bracket that attaches to the toilet bowl according to the instructions. But doing it that way made the front of the seat to be about 1/2"" from the front of the toilet bowl. So, I reassembled the bracket by switching the two black pieces from side to side and flipping them 180 degrees (see photo). Now the front of the seat is even with the front of the bowl. I do not know why they supply Teflon thread sealant tape. All of the fittings are gasketed and thread sealing tape does not do anything to mitigate a leak if the gasket does not do its job. I did not use thread-sealing tape and I am leak free. The functionality of this bidet works well. We like how it cleans and does what it is intended to do."
"Overall, this is a decent bidet and it certainly gets the job done. Installation was a bit tricky and the fitment isn't perfect on my Kohler elongated bowl. Installation requires that you install a mounting plate to the toilet, the plastic bolts that are supplied are difficult to tighten... the nuts must be tightened from underneath and there are no wings to grip with your fingers and standard metric/imperial sockets do not fit, so you must tighten with your fingers and/or pliers which is awkward making it difficult to tighten fully. The elongated seat is a bit small and doesn't fully fit a standard elongated bowl toilet. I had to position the Brondell in the forward-most setting so that the front feet would rest on the lip of the bowl, and even at that setting, only the front half of the feet would touch. At this setting the rear portion of the seat covers the bowl. I've attached photos to illustrate this. In summary, this seat needs a redesign to properly fit an American elongated bowl toilet, it needs to be bigger and the attachment bolts need screw heads on top so you can use a screwdriver (from the top) to tighten them."
"Having seen and used the $200 bidet is the only reason I'm not giving 5 stars. My 1st Bidet was an add on using the existing toilet seat. First these are a nightmare to keep clean. Having seen and used the $200 Bidet you can see the engineering of the ones that come with a seat. Apparently Bidets need to be raised about an inch. The add on blocks to the existing toilet seat were the first thing to go, then it's all down hill from there and the mounting system started breaking. Until it had to be replaced. The Brondell Bidet Toilet Seat is a nicely engineered seat and Bidet. there are similar designs for keeping it clean as the $200 Bidet and where it lacks what the $200 Bidet has the Brondell Bidet Toilet Seat has the quick removal to aid in cleaning. Unlike the add-on the Brondell Bidet Toilet Seat had every thing to mount and connect the water. The self closing is a nice feature too. Yes the electric one have heated water and I live in the mountains on well water that can be quite cold at times, but is no big deal to me."
"I accidentally scratched a toilet seat and as opposed to paint, decided to replace everything including the bidet attachment. I like the easy close feature (it’s quiet)! The seat is plastic so not quite as cold as the previous wood material. Feels solid enough. Cleaning pressure is good and the dial method is effective for operation. Coming from a bidet attachment that is connected by the toilet seat, making cleaning difficult, I’m excited about the removal option! Also, the nozzles recess themselves into the seat so there’s no obstruction to cleaning around the top of the bowl (this is/was a huge deal for me!).

I will say, the hose from the T to the seat is long (as pictured) and the hose sizes are not conventional. I thought I would leave all the previous plumbing from the existing bidet in place and not use the provided hardware but that is not an option. Honestly, it seemed more arduous than it needed to be but after a few trial and leaking errors, it’s sealed up and no leaks are detected. Instructions aren’t great but use the attached pictures and you’ll be able to figure it out. Also pictured, the new Bondell seat is slightly smaller than the previous but it’s not bad and overall a comfortable seat. Hope this helps!"
"I've been looking for a bidet for years and kept hesitating. I used a portable one but this is so much better. A relative who is a plumber kept warning me against them saying they can leak and that was why I held off. I have read reviews of other brand s where people did have major damage from leaks. This brand did not seem to have those negative reviews and the one valve was metal as well. We did have thus installed in our downstairs bathroom just in case through. I would like to put another upstairs but will wait on that.

Since like most American bathrooms we do not have an outlet next to our toilet we went with a non electric. I've been using portable bidets with cold water for years so the cold water is not an issue for us and we live far north. It's refreshing. So much cleaner than toilet paper there is no comparison.

I think both streams hit the right spots and it is excellent. Adjust carefully as I can really power wash! Love the cleanliness.

I hope it holds up and there are no leaking issues because I would like more. I will report back if there is any issue like that as we have only had this a short time."
"This thing is awesome... I never thought I would like something as much as I do this. I always thought a Bidet had to be a whole new toilet configuration until my brother told me his son bought him one for a birthday present. I was like, what! Then I looked it up and thought I would give it a try. The reason I picked this one is because the controls were flush with the lid and it made a nice compact package. I also liked the fact that it was a whole new lid and not just an add-on to the existing toilet lid, like some of the models offered. Long story short, this works GREAT... So much so, I am going to put one in our other bathroom. The only thing I didn't like is the bolts they supply that fasten the lid to the toilet. you have to tighten them from underneath. If your toilet is in a tighter location with walls to either side, it makes it difficult to work on it. I just reused my old ones that I was able to tighten from the top, So, all in all, it's not a big issue. The performance of the device far exceeds what little hassle I had installing it."
"First of all, I did have these (I bought 2) installed by plumber because I don’t trust myself with DIY projects involving plumbing, but the plumber said it was so easy, all the parts he needed were included with the bidet and the instructions were great, he installed 2 of them in about 45 minutes (including opening packages, removing old seats) so if you’re more of a DIY person, this likely will be very doable for you.

I am so happy I bought these. They look very sleek, no big remotes or other parts attached to the seat which I don’t like, just a small but very user-friendly dial on the side of the seat. The water is cool but not at all uncomfortable, I don’t see the need for heated water at all, and I’m a person who’s big on comfort! I like how the outlets are located just under the seat and they are positioned well. I’m actually using a forward wash for both front and back because it gets both but this bidet has plenty of options so try them all out!"
"This is our second Brondell Swash purchase. The first (three years ago) is an electric Swash and we're very happy with it. We wanted to add another Swash to the second bathroom, but there's no nearby power outlet. So we opted for the nonelectric version, which I didn't even know existed.

It's great--much more compact and streamlined than our other Swash and the manually operated water nozzles deliver a much stronger--and adjustable--stream of water with the twist of a knob on the side of the seat.

The nonelectric Swash looks a lot more like a regular toilet seat because it's compact/fewer components inside, and with the lid down, you can slt on the seat without feeling like you're going to slide onto the floor.

Since I live in SoCal, our cold water isn't all that cold, but if we were still in Chicago, I probably wouldn't buy this type of Swash.

Screwing all the hose couplings together was a bit of a back-breaker and a challenge. We have a slight drip on the water supply hose from the wall to the T-valve, and may need to replace that hose. It leaks even using Teflon tape.

Also, connecting the water hose to the bidet seat was tough. All the water connections were tight and need to be made very carefully. ...

In attaching the T-valve to the bottom of the toilet tank, I inadvertently broke the internal seal on the cold water inlet inside the tank. The toilet is more than 15 years old and the gasket pretty much disintegrated when twisted. So, even though the tank is not dripping now, I'll probably have to have a plumber replace the toilet's water supply gasket or the entire water supply assembly inside the tank.

Also, the female coupling on the cold water hose which attaches to a male on the seat, was difficult to screw on. The male is just threaded black plastic. The hose kept screwing on crooked. I used Teflon tape, but not the tape that came with the seat, which was too thick, and FINALLY got the hose connected correctly to the bidet seat. Whew. But, still very happy with this purchase."
"I'd gotten a bidet for the regular toilet downstairs, and wanted to add one upstairs, but that's a french curve toilet. Very few bidets fit, and most of them are excessively expensive or custom made for it. After seeing a few reviews for this one saying it would fit, I figured I'd try it. It absolutely fits the Kohler french curve. There's about 1/2"" of clearance between the knob and the base it rests on, and over an inch of clearance from the curve edge. The hose has to go up from the seat instead of back, but it's still easily out of the way.

The issues I ran into during installing are related to the french curve toilet. There's no underside to the holes, so you have to sort of guess the position, install the seat, then move it around to figure out where it should be. Then you have to remove the seat from the base--THE BUTTON FOR THIS IS ON THE RIGHT SIDE. Press the button and it slides right off. It took me a while to figure that out, but then I got it positioned well and tightened down.

The water works well. The clean function is a bit too much spray everywhere, it would be better if it could direct that more downward so I don't have to dry as much. Still, it works, and the cleaning function also work.

Overall it's the best solution I've found for french curves. Definitely recommend."
"Unfortunately I live in an older house so we don't have any outlets near our toilets, so finding a quality bidet that is non-electric was a godsend, and it's also very affordable. I was always intrigued by bidets, the thought of using water to wash yourself after going #2 just made a lot of sense. I typically would have to use a lot of toilet paper and it would cause so much chafing, especially during times where I have to go a lot. Using the bidet I just give a quick 5-10 second rinse, wipe once to make sure and dry off, then good to go. Now my costco toilet paper purchase is a yearly supply at minimum. In the long run this will save my butt and save me money. Sure, the water is cold, but honestly, even in the dead of winter it's far preferable to wiping. Once you get used to it, it's quite refreshing. I understand that for some this would be a deal breaker, but for me, I'll never go back."
"Elongated S102 seat inner hole opening diameter measures 11 inches front to back, and approximately 7.75 inches left to right at the widest part of the opening.

Edit: 7/26/22 (MM/DD/YY)
I liked it so much I purchased a second one on 7/8/21 for my other bathroom. The first one bought 1/4/20 is doing fine but the plastic hot water hose has started to yellow in color and the chrome(paint?) has started to look a little worn on the control dials. Through repeated cleaning with Lysol, I managed to accidentally rub off the Brondell logo, which has improved the look of the seat altogether. Nothing else but cosmetic changes to report. The second bidet came with the sticker used to indicate the markings on the control dial a little misplaced and peeled up on one side.

Original Review:
I've had it for about 9 months so far.

Installation:
The bidet wasn't exactly ""hard"" to install, it was more just my inexperience with plumbing and having to switch out copper supply pipes for flexible ones, checking for leaks, drilling a hole in my vanity to pass the hot water tube through and all that, but in the end the connections where the hot and cold tubes connect to the bidet itself, actually leaked. I had to put tons of plumbers tape to get them to stop leaking. The final time i taped it, when i tested the pressure, the connection shot out a little mist spray at my bathroom vanity cabinet and then hasn't leaked since. I am very careful about never touching the connections out of fear it would spring some sort of leak again. I ended up having to use the like ""last resort"" mounting holes in the seat bracket, because I needed my seat as far forward as possible to align with the edge of my toilet. The seat is actually really comfortably shaped, and doesn't cause nearly as much tingling or numbness in the legs as do standard toilet seats if you are sitting for a couple minutes.

Use:
I was worried about the water pressure because my home has somewhat inconsistent water pressure at times, but the pressure is strong--sometimes even too strong, but that's not entirely a bad thing considering the product was able to take this inconsistent water pressure and turn it into a strong jet. I found that I can actually purposefully get the pressure to be a little weaker, if upon activating the bidet spray, I turn the dial a little bit back towards ""off"" or ""self clean"" and the spray weakens for a bit instead of the nozzles immediately retracting. As much as i installed both a hot and cold water line, I end up preferring to have the mixer dial more towards cold, because that's not nearly as jarring as getting blasted with scalding water when someone opens a cold faucet elsewhere in the house, taking from your cold water supply. I do enjoy the unit and it does cut down on but does not eliminate toilet paper usage. (You've still got to wipe the water off yourself. I wouldn't trust using any reusable or ""communal"" towels for this purpose as you are only ""hosed-down"", not sanitized, and definitely still contain bathroom residue whether you like it or not.)

Cleaning the unit:
I wash the water jets with soap and water at least once weekly and I haven't had any issues with visible bacteria or mold growth. After gently pulling on the nozzles to expose them and soaping them down with a paper towel, I let them sit for a few minutes and then close the seat lid and run the self clean function on each nozzle to rinse the soap out. The self-clean kind of sprays in a mist and sometimes that water can spray out under the front of the seat, misting your bathroom floor. I've only used the quick release on the mounting bracket a few times to get a decent clean under the seat. You should want to check underneath here once in a while for ""number one"" splatter or old dehydrated liquid cleaner residue up underneath--between the seat and the mounting bracket, especially if you have males using the toilet, amplifying the amount of splatter you may have. I am very cautious when using the quick release function in fear of bumping the water connections.

For standard seat maintenance I recommend spraying a paper towel with a mild cleaner and then wiping the seat and all of its outer casings to clean it, instead of spraying the seat directly--because the sprayed cleaner runs down the seat and seeps between the hardware and adds to the liquids that gather in crevices and underneath the mounting bracket.
The indications for ""front wash"" and ""back wash"" are printed within a gel-like bubble-dome sticker that is applied to the circular face of the control dials. I would not spray this directly with cleaner as to discourage damage to the adhesive. I check the plastic mounting nuts underneath the back of the toilet for tightness once in a while if I notice the seat has any extra wobble to it (not often).

My Complaints and Concerns:
-I am uncertain of the longevity of the plastic tubing used for the hot water pipe.
-I wasn't happy with the small leaks I experienced while connecting the hoses that came with the unit to the unit itself, thus having to use plumbers tape and hope it wouldn't spring a leak again.
-Mildly annoyed that the self-clean function can spray mist underneath the front of the seat and onto the bathroom floor."
"I have had one of these before in another house, so when we moved I bought one for each bathroom. They are easy to install and I like the seat and soft-close lid. However, the knob on the one we use the most has gotten very hard to turn. When I looked it up online, it seems others have had this issue and that there is a plastic piece inside the metal cover that breaks. I’m going to reach out to the manufacturer and will update my review if it can be fixed.
Update- contacted the manufacturer and after explaining the issue, they gladly sent me a new one. Easily replaced the other and this one works great! So I have had four of these and guess the other was just defective. These are great not only for the bidet, but also because the seat doesn’t slip like so many do."
"We were recently staying with family whose recent home renovation included installation of a non-electric bidet for all the toilets . We became convinced of the need to install in our own house so after a thorough search, we ordered the Brondell bidet seat. The main criteria we looked for was having a round seat for our Niagara toilets and being non-electric. After receiving and installing our first ever bidet, we became big fans of this particular brand of bidet seats. First of all, the installation is super easy -- we simply followed the instruction booklet that was included. It also comes with tape and an extra rubber O ring for convenience. The seat fits firmly on the toilet, without give, and feels solid. We weren't looking for a dual nozzle in particular but now we can't imagine the bidet with only a single one. Best of all, compared to bidets we used in the past, the Brondell really cleans better! We were so convinced, we immediately ordered another seat for our second bathroom."
"This is my first bidet seat (non-electric) and after several uses, it's a pretty good seat. I got non-electric because the water doesn't get too cold in southern Florida so heated water wasn't necessary. My husband had some difficulty getting it put on. He is very handy with electrical, drywall, woodwork and general DIY tasks, but he hates plumbing, something always leaks for him. I love the design of the seat, not big or overpowering. The one con is that the plastic feels a bit cheap (thin) so we will have to see how it holds up going forward. At this point I would recommend this seat as a simple solution bidet."
These are our third and fourth bidets we've owned and the problem with the last ones (The Clear rear Buttler) was the relation of the accessory and the existing toilet seat. The Brondell unit removes this concern because it's a toilet seat and bidet in one unit. The single control aims for the (shared) target by turning it backwards (anti-clockwise) or for her target (clockwise). The mounting bracket securely holds the unit in place on the rim while you move about cleaning the areas. The soft close feature keeps everything quiet as well. Highly recommend this unit for anyone who loves to be clean!
"I used absolutely no tools on this installation.
Installation difficulties- first and foremost-the water line that screws into the water outlet on the seat. Do this first! When screwing on a sharp fine internal stainless thread onto a outside diameter threaded soft plastic(delrin) fitting, it is EXTREMELY easy to strip the plastic thread. I'm a machinist and I could not start this thread correctly by hand with the seat mounted to the toilet. I cut threads for a living. Even with the seat off the toilet, I found I had to sit down and put the parts on a table to start this thread correctly. This is SO EASY TO CROSS-THREAD its unreal. And when you do get it started correctly its it virtually indistinguishable from cross threading. There is so little pressure needed. Brondell-please change the thread pitch on this to a coarser thread. The coupling attachment is acting as a thread die if you cross thread because the threads are so sharp. So little pressure needed, and such a vital connector get correct.
Once you get that attached, the second hurdle is the seat attachment to the toilet. Heres the thing-you assemble a multi-piece bracket which mounts to the toilet. The seat slides onto the bracket, but DOES NOT LOCK IN POSITION. Its just a friction fit. The bracket takes some repositioning to align the seat properly so leave those toilet bolts loose. Once you get everything aligned, slide the seat onto the dovetail in the bracket. There is no click. Awkward. When things look good, tighten the bolts down by hand.
I assembled everything by hand. I actually expected some leaks because i hadn't used any wrenches on anything. No leaks at all!

Soft close seat and cover. Pretty sturdy lid. Im a huge guy and I can sit on the lid(for a couple minutes) but you can feel it start to flex.
The bidet knob has a good feel to it. Weighted rotation. Knurled metal knob which feels very solid. 3 detents each way. One for off, one for pre rinse. Keep turning past rinse detent and bidet starts. Keep rotating for more pressure. Counter back through rinse position, then continue to off position. Forward direction if you wish to use feminine spray. Rearward direction for posterior.
The actual seat is hollow underneath and has 4 solid contact areas with flat rubber impregnated bumpers. The seat does creak a bit when new, but I'm a hulking massive Goliath. Average folks probably would have no issue. And its not a loud creak. Doesn't feel fragile. Plastic is actually a softer kind of feel, yet durable.

Also kind of an issue is the amount of space the bidet takes up when the seat is up across the rear of the bowl. Roughly 5-10% on my round toilet. Not bad just have to get used to it.

The bidet itself actually works really well. The pressure adjustment works well and has ample pressure. There is a water noise from the line when you turn it on. Which is expected.

Prior to this I tried the luxe bidet. That was a bad experience. Tilting the seat out of position. Cheaply made. Didn't work well for women. So I literally threw it away after about 6 weeks. If you have a woman using a bidet, buy one with feminine wash or don't buy one at all. My wife had issues with UTI with the luxe in a high traffic bathroom. This brondell is in a low traffic much cleaner situation.

I bought the warranty with this unit.

I will post updates.

UPDATE-second bidet purchased for use with a brand new American Standard Cadet 3 round toilet. Our first bidet is on a GLACIER BAY which has a recess in the front of the tank to accommodate the seat. No problems.
The new Cadet does not. Just has a standard curved tank lid. Without this recess, we are having trouble with the toilet seat staying up. There isn't really enough room vertically for the lid and the seat. Maybe it's because everything is brand new. But for now I am using a rubber band to hold the seat to the lid. I think it's because everything is new it just takes a few days to break in the plastic? Not sure. I'll try it again next week. If it's still not cooperating, I'll probably have to move the seat mount forward a bit to gain some extra rear tilt when the seat is up.

Also of note-The Cadet bowl top rim is completely flat. Great space for the feet to rest when the seat is down. Ideal. The Glacier Bay has a rounded rim, which is not ideal, but works fine with the rubber feet under the seat."
"I agree with another review I saw saying this is better than the tushy. At least the tushy classic. It does sit forward a little more than I thought since I got the elongated one. I made sure to measure the toilet before hand. Maybe I haven't snapped it in all the way, but last I checked it was. Either way, it's nothing unbearable. I don't have to shift around trying to get in the right spot. And love that the knob doesn't protrude out. A clean look."
"First time user.
The opening in the seat is not as big as you may be used to. As with any seat, install it enough forward on the bowl so the seat opens and stands on its own. When open, the seat seems to contact the lid, therefore does not open fully.
The bidet has two nozzles (rear and forward) and a ""self cleaning"" function. As the knob is turned, the bidet goes through self cleaning regardless. This self cleaning is a water spray that gets everything wet that is exposed in the seat. Continue turning the knob and the desired nozzle pops out and sprays. There is no way to adjust for ""bullseye"" (HA) except to wiggle around. Depending on water pressure, the jetting can be harsh.
It's a bidet. It uses water. You get wet. Either you dry off or you drip. Elimination of toilet paper is not realistic. Maybe use it before a shower.
Particles may go everywhere. You'll know what I am talking about when you use one.
Interestingly, using cold water has not been that much of a problem."
"My only regret about the purchase is I didn't get a fancier one. But the cool water is a great wake up in the morning. My toilet paper consumption has gone down. I wished it had a warm setting. I bought this because I'd been curious and its been my favorite purchase in years. I guess im finally an old person, because I'm getting excited over a water fixture. I highly recommend this product, Americans need to join the modern world and wash our asses. I'm less itchy, and i feel fresh."
"Flawed design or mine's defective, the bidet doesn't have a internal directional check valve built into the hot water side, so because its bi directional, when you turn on your sink hot water, you get pull thru cold water from the bidet, so it takes longer for the hot water to get hot while you clear the ambient water from the water line (think mornings), and your sink hot water will also never get as hot as before because its always pulling cold water from the bidet. Technically not a functional problem with the bidet but it’s just bad engineering, emailed Brondell support and got no response.

Update: ordered a replacement thru Amazon, original was indeed a defective check valve as new unit has no issues, would be 5 stars but -1 for Brondell’s customer service.

Update 2: Brondell did respond (wait time 10 days) saying they have check valves at each water inlet, but is not certified for back flow prevention."
"I purchased this model for a bathroom with a round seat. I already have a long-seat model 1001 electric with washer and heater that I love. It has adjustable heat, spray power, and location ($400). This model (<$90) is simpler. Easy to install and use but the main issue is that the distance to the cleaning area is fixed. Therefore, you must move forward or backward while seated and washing so it cleans the right spot. Otherwise, it works well."
"Why do we use toilet paper? This basically eliminates the need for TP and cleans everything down there. It feels incredibly refreshing and I’m willing to bet that it will reduce irritation that I typically get from wiping and not getting everything.
It took me 15 minutes to install with no issues. I also thought the cold water was going to be a big downside of this bidet, but again, it’s actually quite refreshing. Don’t wait any longer; ditch toilet paper and get yourself one of these for every toilet in your home."

 I was looking to replace the toilet seat in my hallway half-bath with a soft close, since I noticed that on occasion my guests would drop the seat a little hard. It's an older house and I guess folks are getting used to having a soft-close on everything. My half bath is tiny and has a small, round Eljer toilet from the 70s, so I was thrilled to find a combo that would fit it.

Anyway, as a fan of bidets and occasional user of my own half bath, I thought this would be a great upgrade to get both out of the way. The price was right, and it was well reviewed!

Installation took me less than 10 minutes. I noticed the water line length was pretty generous - many more inches than needed, so I had to tie some back a little. Unlike my other bidets which have a visible control knob, this one is semi-hidden to the side. At first, I thought it might be problematic since you can't see the usage label unless you look from the side (not possible in this tiny bathroom), but after giving it a ""trial run"" I realized it's fairly intuitive - turn it forward for front (feminine) use, and backward for....rear...use.

Upon my very first use, I was initially pleased that turning it on and off required going through a ""self-clean"" setting, but after a few seconds I realized that perhaps that actually wasn't such a great idea. You see, the problem is that during self-clean, it's blasting water at full strength into wastewater. Wastewater that contains things you JUST got rid of. You will realize this is an issue as you feel the aerosolized contents landing on your skin. I consider this a bit of a design defenciency, but not so much that I'd dock it more than one star or return it. I'll just have to remember not to linger on the self-clean setting right after usage - although unfortunately my guests won't have the luxury of that knowledge.

The soft-close works well. The included installation kit appears flexible enough to fit a variety of toilets with different seat hole offsets. Overall, it seems like a quality product with the exception of the forced self-clean cycle. I am now convinced that should ALWAYS be a separate function like it is on every other bidet I've ever purchased.

I'm unsure if there are alternatives in this price range that do away with that deficiency, but depending on you feel about the potential splashback while shutting it off (not an issue if you're quick enough), I think it's a good buy."
"Got this for a coop apartment bathroom where access to hot water or electricity was not an option. I first tried a cheap ""basic"" bidet, and ... wow what a life-changing improvement! I will never ever want to do without a bidet!!! Clean and refreshing, and great to minimize use of toilet paper. It was a real lifesaver during COVID when that stuff was hard to come by. Just want to say also, I really prefer the nonelectric bidet to the fancy (and pricey) versions with controls more complex than an airline cockpit. Simple is often better! Although, having access to hot water would be nice...cold water only is fine for summer but a bit of a trial in winter. You can set this up with a preset mixture of hot & cold water, if you are lucky enough to have that option.

The ""basic"" bidet was always leaking, and it got old having to keep a bucket and adjustable wrench in my bathroom. I figured this one would be better made and shouldn't leak if installed correctly, and that's proven to be the case. The hoses are steel rather than plastic for example. The only problem, worth knocking off a star, is that the control is not great. I would really prefer a lever to the knob. The knob does work but it's harder to use (remember you have to use it by touch only, you can't see it when you're, ahem, in position) and control the water flow than the lever on the ""basic"" bidet."
I bought this for a family member and are thinking of buying one for ourselves. The knob is nice- quality and not bulky. I love that it’s a whole seat and I can let go and it slowly closes on its own. Great to have with the kids- no slamming of the seat! It is very comfortable to sit on. And it works great. Only complaint is it doesn’t quite hit the front unless you sit up unnaturally straight but does the job. Install was easy as well.
"My husband had been after me to try a bidet seat for awhile but for whatever reason I was hesitant. Now that we've had it a couple of months, I wonder why I waited so long? He loves it, I love it. Leaves you feeling clean and refreshed! We're moving in a few months and will be buying another for our new home."
"After using this bidet for approximately a month, I am so fortunate to have chosen the bidet built in to the seat. It works just as described & does a great job. I don’t always use the hot water, but nice to have when you want it. I like that other than seeing the two little round knobs on the side, you’d never see that it’s a bidet as everything is hidden. Well worth the price. Highly recommend."
Awesome stuff. Love it. The only thing I get to say is the cover doesn’t stay up right when open sometimes because there is no room( gap) left between seat and cover to get tilted backward more.They need to upgrade their design.
"This is the 4th bidet I've purchased and my first Brondell. I also use the TOTO C200, Genie Bidet Seat, and the Genie Bidet toilet attachment.

Let me start by saying, once you have any bidet seat, there is no going back to using dry toilet paper. As many have said, it is life changing and if you haven't bought one yet you REALLY need to get one. After purchasing my first bidet I tried to think of any negative aspect to using a bidet and it took a long time before I finally thought of one bad side effect of buying a bidet. I now have a bit of anxiety any time I have to poop away from my home. My whole family and all my friends that have bidets have confessed, they now dread having to poop in a non-bidet toilet. If we have any chance of making it home, we will hold on for dear life to get back to our wonderful bidets before succumbing to smearing our yuck all over ourselves. I really hope, in the near future, all new commercial toilets have built in bidets so we can stop wiping our butts like cavepeople whenever we use a public toilet.

Anyway, I bought this model because, although I really like my Genie bidets, I thought it would be nice to have a warm water spray like I do with my electric TOTO. Cold water isn't as bad as it might sound on the back side but having warm water is a plus, especially in the winter. So I put in the Brondell because I don't have a conveniently located power supply near this particular toilet but it is right next to the sink. My opinion is likely jaded because I've already experienced my other bidets but here are my main complaints:

1. Unlike my TOTO that instantly delivers consistent warm water, the Brondell needs the cold water cleared from the pipes all the way from the water heater. Since I'm close to the sink, I can reach the faucet and turn it on for a bit until the warm water gets to the sink. Then I only need to flush the cold water in the line a short distance from the sink to the bidet. This isn't that big of a deal but, in order to get the warm water benefit, it's more steps that I have to go through than I realized when I bought the bidet.
2. The bigger issue is how wide and powerful the spray is. My Toto and Genie's all have a somewhat narrow spray. Because of this I tend to rock back and forth and shift left and right a small amount to get all the necessary areas. The Brondell is more like a fire hose. It gets everything all at once, which might sound like a good thing except it is too wide and strong. Every part of me that is inside of the seat perimeter is misted by the overspray, even at the lowest pressure setting. It's just a bit too much and rather than a single wipe to dry things, it takes many more squares of toilet paper to dry off my entire underside.

3. There can be confusion when visitors use the bidet. Because there are two knobs on the side of the bidet that are both round, it can be confusing, while seated, to know which one controls the spray and which controls the temperature. We have had instances where someone attempts to turn on the spray and instead turns the temperature knob to full hot. When nothing happens, they switch their hand to the correct knob and turn on the spray which soon becomes painfully hot. As a result, I now try to remember to give any visitor a quick warning and some guidance on how to use that particular bidet. I never had to do that with my previous bidets.

On the plus, it is a good quality bidet. The seat is solid and doesn't flex which is a minor grip I have with the Genie seat. All the components seem well made and I don't expect to have any problems with the longevity of this bidet. In the end, any bidet is a million times better than not having a bidet at all. If you can't stand having cold water on your backside, and don't have any electrical outlet nearby, then this is a fine bidet. As for myself, the overspray and the extra hassle of waiting to get the warm water to the bidet, makes me wish I saved a few bucks and just got another cold water only bidet."
"This is our second Brondell Bidet Toilet Seat Non-Electric. This one for
our guest bathroom. Took me less than 15 minutes to install perfectly.
Something no one mention, I have a bad lower back and can't twist to
reach around. This seat does the job for me wonderfully. Highly recommend!"

 This was a cinch to install.
I did it myself in 15 minutes after I called a plumber to replace my non-functioning shut off valve (which had to be replaced anyway).

I’m an idiot with unopened tools my Dad gave me - which I didn’t need since my hand tightening is fierce and an extra 1/4 turn was achieved with one of those open adjustable wrenchy thingamadoohickeys.

There was an extra rubber washyjig (3 total) in the large female end of the included connector T bobbitty. I had to take 1 out to screw it into the commode. Otherwise, install would’ve been 10 minutes.

It’s beyond great.
The round model fit my commode perfectly.
It’s molded very comfortably.
The bidet dial is streamlined, simple to use and barely noticeable.
The seat material is room temp which is comfy.
It auto closes softly when you tip it down.
It has an easy release for cleaning.

The cleansing nozzle pre-sprays are a mist utilizing pressure.
The bidet cleansing function in both modes ranges very effective to Super-soaker.
I’m not sure who can tolerate the full throttle fierce cleanse, but it’s there in case Thor uses your loo during an Asgardian case of junk funk.
We’ll need to see studies, but a full dial might be a form of birth control - especially in colder ‘ambient’ climates. (*That was a joke, do not attempt this, unless you want kids and a microflora imbalance.)

It was a ‘refreshing’ feel here in 68°F December with a modest dial turn in pressure, but much cooler or more dial would be something to get accustomed to or consult your physician about (even if you think you’re Loki descended from a frost giant and/or feel marvelous about butt stuff, it’s a lot). Jusayin.’

I tested the dial after install, before using it, not realizing it would shoot out across the hallway to entertain my kittens while catching the new holiday LED lights (thanks again Amazon) like a Bellagio fountain. If it played Billie Eilish, or Tchaikovsky’s Sugar Plum Fairies, I could charge admission.

Sorry for the Nutcracker overshares.
It’s a puissant (non electric ambient temp) bidet seat in every way."
"I had my first one for about a year, the dial to control the sprayer became more stiff over time. Eventually it completely broke off and would not turn the sprayer on or off. Aside from that, no other issues and worked great."
This is a very nice bidet/seat. It looks and feels like a very good quality unit. I bought a second one the day this ine was installed. I wanted one on both of my toilets. I'll never go back to tissue paper alone!
"The Brondell Swash Ecoseat 102 has solved my problems!

We have had an electric Brondell Swash 1000 bidet for about 20 years. When I first installed it, I had our electrician install a GFI outlet near the toilet base to power it. Three moves later, we were up to 4 GFI installations for the same bidet. I only used the bidet occasionally, like when I had diarrhea, although my wife used it more often. Now, at the new house, I had my own bathroom, but with no bidet. My wife had the electric bidet in her bathroom.

I realized I now needed to do something more about my bathroom hygiene. Most annoying was, with my advanced age, my scrotum had sagged, and I was constantly getting it wet with my new toilet seat - a problem I never had using the Brondell bidet seat. I tried a taller $18 bumper kit to slightly raise my new seat, but I still had the problem - just not as bad. Secondly, with advancing age, my butt cheeks had also sagged, and often I now had a mess after a bowel movement. It was time time to reconsider whether I needed to use a bidet’s wash feature on a much more regular basis.

Reluctant to invest in having a 5th bidet GFI installed, I started researching non-electrical bidets for under $100. Since I had installed a recirculating pump with valves that used the cold water piping to quickly provide hot water at the hot water faucets, at the slight expense of having lukewarm water come out of the cold water faucet for 20 to 40 seconds, I figured I could get away with a short cold (in my case, lukewarm) bidet water wash instead of the heated wash of our electric Brondell 1000.

My search of the customer reviews for non-electrical bidets for under $100 gave me causes for alarm. One reviewer said that the bidet lid would not stay up by itself when a male went #1, and he had to hold it up. Another reviewer said that the bidet seat was not strong enough to hold his weight when he sat on it (I often sit on the toilet seat while dressing). Another reviewer said the bidet seat banged when he put it down. A forth review said the plastic pipe fitting for the bidet water supply broke while he was away, flooding his house with 8000 gallons of water and causing $40,000 in damage. I decided I should look at bidets that cost more than $100.

The reviews were much better for these slightly more expensive bidets. I did not even know that Brondell made a bidet in this price range, and only stumbled upon a description of the Brondell Swash Ecoseat 102, just as I was finalizing my buying decision. For about $30 more, I had a Brondell bidet, which had metal pipe fittings, a strong seat that stayed up when one wanted it up, and went down slowly and quietly when one was done, and had a name that I had come to trust. The Ecoseat 102 also had the additional feature that, if I wanted warmer water, I could run an included hot water line to the bidet as well, and the seat had an adjustment knob, that let me mix the hot and cold water to get my desired temperature.

I bought the Brondell Swash Ecoseat 102, and installed it with just the cold water line and a plug on the hot water line. After trying the new bidet out, I found that the lukewarm water disappeared before I was done cleaning up, so I decided to run the hot water line to the bidet as well. Fortunately, my toilet backed up to my wife’s lavatory in her bathroom, and I was able to run the hot water line thru the opening for her lavatory hot water faucet. I drilled a single 5/16 inch hole that passed through only I sheet of drywall in my bathroom, and used only about 15 inches of the 81 inches of plastic tubing provided for this purpose.

Unwittingly, I had solved two other problems. By running hotter water for a longer time, in a large, adjustable stream, my bowel is stimulated to more completely evacuate, and in a shorter elapsed time. In summary, a great bidet at a very reasonable price, that solved my problems."
"I like the design of this unit as it is so easy to clean. The seat up position has a single surface that is easy to wipe down and the nozzles unexposed.

The knob and self cleaning option is great.

Installation requires really no tools but players help and maybe a flat head screw driver depending on your outgoing seat.

Water pressure compares favorably with my powered alpha ux Pearl. Though broader spray with the brondel so you do get a bit more splash on the cheeks… getting used to the cold water is a bit cheeky vs the more luxurious heated units but still light years better than barbaric toilet paper!"
First time buying one of these. Picked this brand because it says good customer service and had good reviews. Non electric but came with a water line to connect to plumbing. So far I like it a lot. These do tend to leave the underside of the seat wet but not a big deal.
"I always read the reviews before purchasing your product and after reading the reviews for this bidet, I decided to move forward. I know there are a few products, if any, in which 100% of the people were satisfied. I have had no issues with the bidet and am enjoying it. I don’t have issues with it spraying awkwardly or getting water on the floor. It hits exactly all the right spots. Sometimes moving slightly forward slightly backwards is better. Though it is not heated, I have not found the water is not shockingly cold - pretty much feels like room temperature. That or either that area is not as sensitive to cold as one might think. I found no issue with bacteria or anything splashing up against the nozzles as they do retreat when not in use. Again, this is just my experience."
"These seats work well and are easy to install. We had friends at our Airbnb and after using these decided to equip their house with them. More and more people are using these instead of wipes to feel clean after doing their business. Once you use a bidet, it's disappointing to use a toilet without one. The seat feels a little forward sloped on every toilet we have this on (4 total), but it's not uncomfortable. The water comes from your toilet supply line, so it is not heated, but also no need to install an electrical outlet near your toilet, which can be expensive and difficult to do. The cold water spray from the seat is not bad at all when it's not heated. No one complains about the temperature being cold."
"Review of Brondell Swash Ecoseat Non-Electric Bidet Toilet Seat, Fits Elongated Toilets, White - Dual Nozzle System, Ambient Water Temperature - Bidet with Easy Installation @ $89.99

I am one of those people that just could not easily, satisfactorily, and quickly sanitize myself after going to the bathroom. I did a lot of research before trying a bidet. This brand seemed to stand out on ratings and this seat seemed most within my budget. I am really glad I purchased this!

Installation: I installed this myself. I watched a couple of videos after reading the instructions in order to help. Videos and instructions are cloudy on the brackets that go onto/into the seat plate beneath the seat. Mine did not look like the ones in the videos or instructions, but they seemed to only fit properly one way. Connecting the T-valve onto the toilet tank inlet was problematic in that it kept cross-threading. I ended up not using any of the supplied Teflon (plumber's) tape on that connection and finally got it to thread correctly. The rest of the connections went smoothly, and I used the provided tape on all of those. Adjusting the seat is done by moving it forwards or backwards to align with the front of your stool, and then you tighten the bolts down by hand. The instructions say no tools are needed, so I hand tightened them for fear of ruining them if I used a tool of any kind. No matter how many times I have repositioned the seat, it ends up to the farthest back position. Everything else went together smoothly.

This seat is hard plastic, and I mean hard. It somehow seems harder than a normal toilet seat. There is no cushy for your Tushi. It causes you to lean slightly forwards. The seat diminishes the size of the opening to your toilet. I understand that its design must keep water from spraying out, but it seems quite a difference in the opening. I find it somewhat difficult to position myself correctly at times when using the bidet. I have never had water spray out though.

The controls are simple and work well. Turning the knob backwards directs the water to the back and turning it forwards directs the water to the front. There are separate nozzles for each position. This is the first time I have had or used a bidet. I wondered before about it possibly creating more of a mess under the toilet seat, but this does not. The spray nozzles are self-cleaning. I found cleaning my toilet bowl just slightly harder than before. The toilet brush I use has the little wire brush on one side and the larger nylon brush on the other. Sometimes, the wire side hits the nozzle compartment a little bit if I am not careful. Otherwise, cleaning the toilet and bidet seat is simple.

I know this is a sort of gross subject to discuss, but I had these questions and decided to address them with my review. I have never felt cleaner after going to the bathroom. It's quick and easy. A little bit of drying yourself with a bit of toilet paper afterwards is all that might be needed. You use a little more water, but a lot less toilet paper or adult wipes, which is what I used before. I wish that I had one of these when I had some surgery on my strong hand as this would have simplified things.

This model offers the cold water only option, which works great for me. I did not want to have to plug my seat into an outlet (I did not have one handy anyway) only to have the power go out and not be able to use the bidet.

I hope this helps you decide whether to order this product."
"I would say if you’re looking to buy this ( Get it) spend the extra money for a quality one. It was easy to install my toilet seat goes down no problem and it’s a soft shut. The water gets you clean, sturdy. I brought a bidet before on here for cheaper and returned it because of problems. I can guarantee you will love this one."
"Urologist recommended a bidet for my wife, so here it is. The installation instructions were adequate, and it wasn't that complicated anyway. I am very impressed with how solid the seat is once installed. It is much more stable than an ordinary toilet seat! The only problem with this (and most other bidets) is the discomfort of washing that portion of one's anatomy with icy cold water, so I made some provisions. I have a crawl space, and I was able to get underneath there and extend a hot water line to a home-made mixer on the toilet supply. (You can buy one from Amazon that does the same thing but I didn't want to wait.) Using a ball valve on the hot water line and a little experimentation I was able to get the water temperature just right. Of course, when you flush it is also using some hot water, but I haven't noticed much change in my power bill. That also serves to keep the water supply at the bidet ready to go."
"Follow instructions for measuring on product listing to determine which seat you need. My bowl seems oval, but the instructions said I needed the round seat , and it was right. It includes instructions for removing your old toilet seat, and detailed instructions for installing the bidet seat. Even for a novice, the instructions are easy to follow. I had old toilet seat off, and new one on, in less than 10 minutes. When I installed mine, I had a small leak on the one line, but per the instructions I knew to remove and reinstall. Which I did, and the problem was solved. You really DO NOT want to use any thing more than hand tightening on the fixtures, or otherwise you will end up either over tightening or breaking the fixture.

As far as function- it is perfectly utilitarian. I have used bidets before, and missed having one, so this was a great purchase for me. The angle of the nozzle for both front and rear usage is spot on. Also, as a woman, I can honestly say this has been a godsend for when menstruating.

The controls are intuitive- turn back for rear, forward for front, middle position for ""neutral,"" or standby/off.

Definitely will recommend. Worth the cost."
"The crown of my porcelain throne has arrived. Upon placing it on, following the instructions provided, I gave it the real test. And, my bumpers are still reeling with joy from the experience. Powerful, intuitive and could match any of the bidet, I used in Tokyo, and Dubai. I take proper sanitation of my A-H serious, and the digging and scrapping with wet wipes well.....pretty much wiped me out! Then I saw this online in a search. American home bathrooms, don't have electric plugs near the toilet for the electric version, so after doing my due diligence, I got one to see if it will meet my requirements. That being said, I will get three others, as this non electric version is incredible."
"This is much more comfortable than the style of bidet that go under your existing seat. Much easier to keep clean, too. We’ll be buying this style from now on. Very sturdy, very comfortable. Highly recommend!"
I have had some not so fun problems lately this not only helps with that but is also saving me a ton on toilet paper. Only problem i had is the measurements for my toilet were really close and my toilet base has some curvature to it so it fit but only the lid will stand open on its own and barely. Can be annoying when trying to clean but it was still well worth it. Only other minor critique may have more to with the house water pressure not sure but either the lowest setting does not spray or it comes out pretty aggressively would be fine if I didn't have issues and overall still works just fine.
"For a round toilet seat this was the best option I could find of this style. I saw one for another brand that had a weirdly thin front part of the seat. Installation was easy, water pressure is great without needing to remove a water pressure regulator, but the one star is removed for the self cleaning feature. I think it's probably a useful and hygienic addition, but it mists your entire underside. I try to move through this setting quickly."
We bought this a year ago and we are happy with the performance. It’s lasted. Has had no leaks and we are happy with it.
"We love it but some time the water does shut all the way and it is no easy to spot so we just waste water running for a while. It also it her lose after a couple of time, so we have to adjust back into the seat at least once at month. It work very well for it intended purposes. Overall we are pleased"
" I recently embarked on a DIY adventure with the Brondell Bidet Toilet Seat, and let me tell you, it's been a game-changer! Installation was a breeze – it took me a mere 10 minutes, and mind you, my plumbing skills are as basic as a goldfish's knowledge of quantum physics.

The soft close seat and lid are a dream, no more loud bangs in the middle of the night that make you wonder if your toilet has suddenly developed a taste for dramatics. But the real crown jewel? The water pressure. It's like Niagara Falls in your bathroom, minus the tourists with selfie sticks. A word to the wise: approach the pressure control with the caution of a bomb defuser. Go slow, but not too slow.

In summary, this Brondell Bidet Seat has been a royal addition to my throne room. Just remember, with great water pressure comes great responsibility. Five stars, would recommend to anyone seeking to upgrade their bathroom experience to first-class!
🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟"
Easy to install and works as advertised.
This unit is the best of the two that I have. I used Amazon’s reviews and see why it’s rated top choice
This is a well built product that works better than I expected. It was easy to instal and use.
"The product was easy to install.
And fully lived up to its claims as to how well it worked!"
"Clean, easy to use. The reassuring of clean, 100%. Thanks again Amazon! A true positive game changer."
Installation was super easy. Works just as advertised. Did not rate the temp control as this model just uses ambient temp water. Very happy with it.
Ordered the bidet seat and then saw the part about customers also got these things. So I did too. Not necessary to do. All that you need comes with the seat. Save your money.
"Was really surprised on how well this product has worked out for me. It was very easy to install got up and running very quickly, and have had no issues with it after owning and using for about a month, would highly recommend.

As a sidenote, start slow on the water pressure"
"Like many of you, I get everything from Amazon. Out of everything I have mindlessly purchased over the years, this is the best.
Simply put:
You will be super clean ✨️"
"All these years I didn’t know what I was missing. This bidet fulfills its primary objective splendidly. It also looks good. Installation was straightforward— I did not need any tools in my circumstance.

I was apprehensive to buy a bidet at first since they aren’t prevalent in America, but I am glad I did and I don’t think I’ll ever live in a home without one again. The additional cleanliness has increased my confidence.

My only complaint is that the lowest pressure setting is still quite powerful. That could just be an artifact of the water pressure in my home. I usually flush once, then use the bidet as the toilet tank is refilling, which reduces the pressure, then flush again after I’m done cleaning up."
"This is fantastic, more like and actual bidet because you can really adjust the water pressure. I have a more expensive Kohler electric one at my other home and I like this better despite the fact that I can’t regulate the temperature and it was so inexpensive and easy to install.
I had considered getting an electric outlet installed in my bathroom here in my vacation home master bath,, but I’m very glad I went the inexpensive route"
"I laughed at these for years, then I gave this a shot. I'll never go back to the old ways. Installed in around 20 minutes, no leaks, and works great. I live in a warm climate so our cold water only gets down to 70* or so in the coldest months. So if you're in the north, I'd recommend one that heats the water."
Bought it because I am having knee replacement surgery. I’m sorry I didn’t get it sooner it works great and easy to install
"Fairly easy to install if you take your time, know which way to turn the threads and have a good attitude about it. I just love this thing! I bought the %100 cotton wash cloths to dry with. Save yourself money and from the chemicals in toilet paper. Stay fresh!"
It has more pressure & hits in a better spot than the 2 bidets I had that cost $500-$600. The ambient water temp is fine. I am sure this will be easier to clean & maintain than the electrified ones with all the bells & whistles. I never knew these existed & had gone to a hand held bidet. This is much better.
"I’ve been tempted to get a bidet for a couple of years now. I held off because I did not want to redo any plumbing or electrical. This one needs neither as it connects to the existing cold water line only.

Not having electric, you forgo some features - like heated water, remote control, air blow dryer, etc. To be honest, none of them concerned me except the heated water. However, that really hasn’t been the issue I thought it would be. I guess that area is not as sensitive as I thought, plus it’s not “cold” water. The water is room temperature, since it sits in the indoor pipes leading to the toilet.

Not having a blow dryer means you can’t completely eliminate using TP, but you do use less. A couple of squares to blot dry (and as a double check).

Anyway, if you’ve been thinking of getting a bidet but, like me, were holding off because of plumbing/electrical issues, this is a very acceptable alternative. Would I like an air dryer, heated seat, warm water? Probably. But I’m way more ok with this than I thought I might be.

Installation is pretty straightforward too. Disconnect existing supply line, install the supplied tee, and reconnect the supply line and the spplied hose that connects to the bidet seat. The hose to the seat is somewhat longer than I’d like, which is probably my biggest negative, but not a deal breaker."
"I am amazed at how easy this product was easily installed. In addition, I used it today for the first time and WOW! I have never felt so clean before after, you know. Good bye wet wipes."
"Easy to install, has everything provided including a T-valve water shut-off. It works great! Having never used a bidet before, I was a little skeptical about purchasing, but my girl has been using a hand sprayer that I installed for her a couple of years ago. I wanted her to have the real deal. Well, this is it! And I actually like using it myself. We are already saving on toilet paper big time ! The water hits a little cold some days, but you get over it in less than one second. When my son came to visit, I had him try it also. He told me that it didn’t work properly. I asked him if he turned the knob backwards until the self cleaning mode finished, because that is when the actual spraying starts, and he replied “no”. He tried it again and this time it was a success. He’s getting one for his apartment for Christmas 👍"
"I put in a Tushy 2.0 bidet a few days ago. It was extremely easy to install and my wife loves it. Our other bathroom doesn't have the room a Tushy requires, so I went with the Brondell. It was almost as easy to install, but I found one step to be slightly confusing because the instructions weren't specific. Had to try it a couple of different ways to make it work, but got it done. Be very careful when sliding on the seat to attach it. Check the left and right sides before you push it in to make sure they're both on track.

This model replaces the seat, and it's both comfortable and looks great.

This bidet is every bit as effective as the Tushy, and while the Brondell is more expensive, if you don't have much space to work with this is the way to go. Both do the job they were made to do quite well, and that's the whole reason to use a one of these."
"I tried two other seats and had to send them back because of various issues. I almost gave up, this was my last attempt. Love this seat! It feels high quality, the assembly was reasonably easy, parts working well, and the water features are exactly as described. The assembly videos helped a lot! Happy with my purchase."
"I wish we would have had this years ago, it’s a game changer. Works great and super easy install."
"If you are looking to get an add on style bidet look no further. This is the way to go, the partial systems pale in comparison."
"I wish I could take back all the years I wasn't using this and all the wasted toilet paper. ALL PROS. Easy to install, accurate and incredibly cleansing and comforting. Only CON I can think of is if installing on a round toilet the surface area of the bowl is taken up a bit more by the bidet than on an elongated bowl, so for guys standing to pee you'll need to be a LITTLE more accurate. But that's hardly a complaint. This thing is a game changer. Buy one and be much cleaner and waste less."
I call it the ass-blaster 2000. Full of power and the promise of a fresh and clean hole.
Works soo good. Controls are discrete enough to not interest the kids. They seem to be leaving it alone. I should have bought one of these years ago.
"I don’t leave reviews. I think I’ve only wrote one or two in my life. But this thing deserves all the praise in the world. I rarely use terms like “life changing” but I feel I can use it here. I bought this 7 months ago and it’s been one of the best decisions I’ve ever made. I watched a South Park episode about bidet’s and it made a lot of sense to me. I’ve been doing it all wrong all these years. Think about it, all the technology we have and we are still wiping ourselves with paper? It’s absurd when you think about it. This thing works so good, the only bad thing I have to say about it is that it works too good. Meaning when you use a toilet without one you realize how stupid it is to use toilet paper and it makes you mad hahahaha. The only thing I would recommend maybe changing is the pressure that the water comes out. It’s hard to get it to come out gently but if you turn the knob really slow it makes a big difference. For the price, it doesn’t even really matter though."
Very easy to install with the video on the website.
"I am very happy with this affordable bidet. It uses cold water ,and it is winter in the Mid West, and the temperature is just fine. I really appreciate having a bidet that I could afford."
Redid my bathroom and this is a must everyone in American needs a bidet in their life using less toilet paper and doing laundry I’ve noticed my underwear are cleaner TMI and I’m not spending as much time on the toilet making my home the only toilet I want to use
"Replaced another bidet and like this one because the seat and bidet are connected, not two separate pieces. The previous bidet didn't work so well being a separate piece from the seat. Tried installing the old one several times and couldn't get it to fit right. Didn't have to worry about it for this all in one unit. Works well after 7 minute installation."
"Bidets are somewhat foreign to Americans. I used one when I was in Portugal. When I got home, I looked them up and talked with friends who use them. Most people expressed how clean they felt after, and how comfortable they are to use once you get the RiGHT one. (Installation and leakage were the most common complaints I heard.) Brondell's bidet seat was easy to install, thanks to the video they provide. There is a stream for the front and the underneath, so men and women can easily control where and how much to spray. Retractable sprayers make it convenient for cleaning the toilet, too. No heat, which is not an issue for me. Most of all, it replaced wet-ones, which I found out was not good for the water pipes or the sewage system where I live. It will pay for itself within a year or two. I highly recommend this model."
"It was easy to install, I like the quick release feature on the lid. The only complaint I have is the same with any soft closing seat/lid, it doesn't like to stay up. I found that if I perfectly balance it at 90 deg it will stay up every time, just wish I didn't have to pay attention to do that..."
"We have had our bidet now for just over a year. It's the best investment we could have made. My wife loves it to. The only reason it's not getting 5 stars is that in the last couple months, the wand for my back side doesn't always retract. So I spray it down with a disinfecting cleaner, and wipe it down. Works good again for a couple weeks, then I have to go through the same process. But that's really our only issue. Great value for the price, money well spent."
"EcoSeat S101 works great! Replaced an older side add on bidet and this one looks so much nicer with bidet incorporated into the seat. Quick start installation guide is too brief, take the time to download the manual from the web site or QR code to see how the bracket is positioned. I had an issue when sliding the seat on to the mounting plate, one side connected other side didn't. I called Brodell's customer service, rep was great, advised me to press the quick disconnect lever on the toilet seat side to release, it worked. Suggested they point out quick disconnect feature better in installation guide"
"Being a guy, I never thought about get one. The wife wanted it for the master bathroom, so we purchased one. Boy once you get used using it you can't live without it. I even bought one for the other bathroom. This one isn't fancy but works well and after 2 years never had an issue. So guys buy one for the wife an enjoy it yourself."
"Disclaimer TMI... Recently I had to have a colonscopy. If you ever had one you know the day before you're procedure you know that you and your toilet will become one!! Anywho, I was in the process of replacing a toilet in another bathroom as well and decided since I was going to be a plumber for a few hours I might as well install a bidet too. This was a quick project maybe 25-30 minutes. Thanks to those who mentioned purchasing the separate t valve. I got one as well. After draining the tank and adding some tape to my threads (no leaks) and assembling the unit I was thoroughly impressed. The water temp is fine. Easy to clean, can slide the unit by pressing the button on side. I like that the unit doesn't stand out. Planning to purchase another, possibly electric with a dryer."
Never knew I needed this until I tried it. It works incredibly well...no more paperwork. Don't need any tickets for the show. It is undoubtedly going to extend the life of our septic system as well. The spray gives you a nice fresh feeling for sure...like a mountain stream. It also makes things easier when you throw your back out and can't reach some areas. I'm happy with the Eco version...I don't think hot water would be as refreshing nor do I have patience to wait for a blow dryer We did have one little glitch with our early version and the company support was right on it. Very pleased.
"This was incredibly easy to install, and it’s really quite nice. It doesn’t have a heating element to it, so if that’s a big deal to you, look elsewhere, but if a heating element isn’t a dealbreaker, this is a solid purchase. I recommend."
"This is a very nice, comfortable toilet seat that is easy to install. Due to the splitter that comes with it you do not require any additional plumbing. Only issue is you are using cold water instead of warm water to rise with."
"I was skeptical about this product but at this price lets give it a go...
I am actually using 1/4 of the toilet paper I use to use... there's just no need.
My derriere is clean as a whistle, bright and shiny, with just one wipe to dab a little water off.
Installation was easy-peasy... good instructions, and can be installed with a pair of pliers
and a flat head screw driver in about 30 minutes. Great Price, Fast Delivery, and fit perfectly
on my ""elongated"" toilet."
"Installation pretty basic, took about 20 minutes to get everything lined up right and secure. Works great! Sends a stream of cold water right where it's needed. Seems solid, no mechanical issues so far, have had it about 2 months."
"UPDATE: You know all the lint and other dirtiness that accumulates under and around the toilet seat hinges? The design of this bidet seat eliminates that. End of update.

I have had this bidet seat for ten days now. I purchased it due to mystery undiagnosed issue that causes me wild irregularity for up to months at a time. I needed something less abrasive than the softest of bathroom tissue.

It took a while to justify the purchase, but I am super happy I did when it was time to replace the cheap toilet seat we had for only a few years.
Amazon Prime shipping was fast. Packaging was secure.

Installation was quick and simple, but I have replaced several toilet seats, fill valves and supply lines before. It's almost as simple as connecting a garden hose. You will need thread tape and a wrench. It is important to not over tighten the connections, but that's important when installing most anything.

The heated toilet seat is crazy awesome, even if it's not cold. My kids love it, too, though they do not get to use the cleaning functions yet.

The actual cleaning nozzle retracts when not being used. It flushes itself with a tiny bit of water before and after use, and again when you stand up.

The rear cleaning function is very effective. The adjustable temperature, pressure, and position allow me to pinpoint the cleaning. I have the temperature and pressure set fairly low, so there is certainly a setting for each person's personal preference.

The water flow begins warm and can finish its cycle without getting cold. The ""massage"" feature oscillates from side to side for more thorough cleaning, though it seems to have its own pressure settings.

Being a man, I have not had opportunity to try the feminine wash cycle myself, but I did test the feature when I completed installation, so I know the nozzle and spray function properly.

After cleaning, the warm air is very pleasant to dry.
Because of my own hygiene OCD, I personally won't trust any bidet 100%. I have been able to completely eliminate use of flushable wipes and the chemicals on them, as well as reduce toilet paper consumption by up to 75%.

A great feature of this one is that you can actually sit on the lid. I checked reviews on many bidet seats before making my decision. Many had complaints that lids were flimsy and broke. Since we sit on the lid to trim toenails, etc, a sturdy lid was a must.

The nightlight is very helpful in the middle of the night. You can see the light peeking out from under the seat as you try to locate the toilet, then when you raise the lid, the entire bowl is illuminated, allowing you to aim by sight, not sound.

But no technology is perfect. This seat has idiosyncrasies common to all bidet seats:
Bidet seats need space for their tanks and retractable nozzles. This reduces the opening at the back of the toilet bowl, but it doesn't seem to affect anything.
There can be a little clear water splashed up on the back of the seat, but maybe I need to adjust nozzle position or sit back more.
The power cord could be a bit longer. I happened to have outlets on either side of my toilet, so no issues with reach.
Warm water tanks have limited size, so you need to allow time for water to heat after a cleaning cycle.
These aspects aren't exclusive to this model. They will happen with all bidet seats using tanks, etc.

Overall, I couldn't be happier with my decision to purchase a bidet seat. Finding such a nice one at a very reasonable price was icing on the cake.

One suggestion I would make is that they include a small roll of thread tape with the seat. It's super cheap and would potentially eliminate a run to local hardware or box store."
"Let me start with my reluctance to write this .... Because as soon as I am done ... Something will go wrong ....

That being said .... This has been the best purchase I have ever made . I have had it for 6 months now and it has worked flawlessly ... My wife and I love it. The seat warmer for starter is a very pleasant and comfortable warmth on those cold days .... Feels cozy .... Also the warm water spay is very nice ... The water cools after a short bit ... But that is no issue for us ... The side controls are fairly easy to access although you need to move some to see them ... Again .... No issue .... Although some have complained about the fan ... We both like it .... True ... It wont dry you completely .... But it does remove some moisture ... No issue ..... We also love the LED light .... Makes it easy to see at night without having to turn on lights and disturbing your spouse ....

Installation was relatively easy ... You need an electrical outlet near the toilet ... I had one installed .... I also installed a filter (Which is highly recommended) .... Please use caution not to over tighten the nuts when installing and make sure washers are in the nut correctly before tightening ....

Since purchasing this Item in October, We have no need to use much toilet paper .... We use significantly less toilet paper (And we all know how things have been trying to get TP these days) ... and We both feel so much cleaner than ever .... A HUGE PLUS !!!!!

I research for months before my purchase and the Brondell Swash SE400 Seat was the one that fit all our needs.... For the cost and and benefits .... It has at this time been perfect .... Measure your toilet to make sure you get the right item .... But at this time ... I would HIGHLY recommend this toilet ... Don't skimp on getting cheaper .... Your Tush deserves the best ... and your spouse will love you too

I haven't had any need at this time to deal with customer service ... so cant comment on them ... This toilet has worked without a problem at of the date of this comment .... Crossing fingers ....

Good Luck on your success if you buy"
"This is quite easy to install. I don't think you need to be particularly handy to do it. Speaking as someone who is only so-so at being handy.

The sprayer, which is of course the main attraction, works well and it's aim is configurable. And I find all the rest of the features useful.

Only nitpick I have is I wish it had a larger water heating reservoir, but not a big deal.

It not having a separate remote was also a deciding factor in the purchase. Seems unnecessary and I prefer to not have to worry about it being misplaced."
"Since our first trip to Japan over 20 years ago, we have been bidet toilet seat believers. We have always used Toto products in our home. When we first built our home in Hawaii, we omitted the bidet and have missed the comfort and cleanliness they provide.

We knew nothing about Brondell or the ""Toto clone"" bidets until seeing them on Amazon. The SE400 seemed to have a good balance of features at a ""value"" price, so we took the plunge.

In all, it is a nice unit for the money.

Shipping was fast, packing was very good, and installation was a snap. The mounting plate design is fairly standard on most bidets, so the installation took less than 15 minutes from the time the box was opened. Installation instructions are simple and clear. The included nylon ""T"" adapter makes water hookup easy. The unit requires standard household power, and the 3 1/2 foot power cord must be plugged into a GFCI outlet or GFCI extension cord for safety. (Don't ignore this important precaution.) In fact, the hardest part of the installation for me was installing a convenient electrical outlet and wiring it into the bathroom's GFCI circuit. (I chose an outlet with integrated USB charging ports to take the place of the magazine rack in the modern bath.)

The unit has nice ""fit and finish"". The controls are well laid out and fairly easy to understand, even at first glance. There are some subtleties to the unit's operation, and the contol of them, that make the time invested in reading the manual worth while.

The factory settings for temperature, position, etc., are middle of the range, and adjustable. The user adjustments are remembered, even if the unit is unplugged.

The side-mounted control arm is conveniently located. The profile of the arm mounting make it easy to install in a tight space. (See picture.) Some folks may wish for a detached remote unit however, so take this into consideration if comparing features with other models.

Being a ""value"" unit, the array of operating features is basic for a bidet seat, but fairly effective at their job.

The single water jet is has the two essential modes: Rear Wash, and Front Wash. Each mode is adjustable in front/back positioning. The jet's water pressure is adjustable across a small range, which is less than the Toto's I have used in the past, but generally adequate. Missing from this model is an adjustment for jet spray width. Its a minor compromise, but you may find yourself ""wiggling for position"" on occasion. The wash modes do have a ""Move"" function which oscillates the jet back and forth. A nice feature in a value model.

The wash cycle, when manually activated, lasts two minutes then shuts off. You can restart the cycle immediately by pressing the wash button again. You can shut off the wash function (or also the dry function) at any time by pressing the Stop button.

The wash system uses a small reservoir tank for storing and a small electric element for heating the water to your selected temperature. We have always used tankless units with ""On-demand"" heating, and the reservoir system is somewhat of a disappointment in comparison. The principal shortcoming is the inconsistency of delivered water temperature. As the washing proceeds the water cools off as the heating element struggles to keep up. The issue is most noticeable at the maximum temperature and pressure settings, as one might expect, but is evident at all settings. When the reservoir is replenished, the water does reheat relatively quickly (however, our standing water temperature is probably around 70 degrees. Colder water will take longer, of course.)

The drying function is fan forced, heated air. The air temperature is adjustable, and the fan is relatively quiet. I was pleasantly suprised this was more effective than the same drying function on my Toto units.

This model does not include a carbon deodorizer filter that other models have.

A ""luxury"" feature that did find its way onto this model is a heated seat. Very nice for those trips to a cold bathroom! There is no time-of-day control, so the seat is heated continuously when the function is engaged.

This model includes a switchable LED ""night light"". A nice feature for finding the toilet in a pitch black bathroom. Its probably just me seeing too many horror movies in my youth, but the blue glow reminds me of those scenes where we would shout ""Don't go in there!""

There are three ""specialty"" buttons: Auto, Eco and Massage.

Auto initiates a one minute rear wash/dry cycle with settings for temperature and pressure at the middle of the range.

Eco sets the water and seat temperatures to 85 F.

Massage is designed to cycle the wash jet pressure up and down. I didn't really notice much of a effect in this mode, however.

Our home is 100% solar powered, so energy use is a consideration. When plugged in, not heating water in the reservoir or heating the seat, and not in use, this model draws less than 1 watt. The water heater draws about 600 watts when activated. How long and often the water heater turns on depends on temperature setting, feed water and room air temperature. The seat heater draws 20 - 60 watts, depending on temperature setting and Eco mode use. The wash function uses about 5 1/2 watts (when not heating water) and 10 watts when the Move function is engaged. The Dry mode uses about 120 watts on medium temperature setting. A 2 minute wash, 2 minute dry cycle at medium temperature and pressure with an unheated seat consumes less than 0.03 kwh (kilowatt hours). By my reconing, the seat heater is the biggest energy consumer. It can be turned off, of course, but it would be much nicer if there was a time-of-day setting to help conserve energy. The Eco mode setting consumes 20 watts while heating the seat.

This is a new model, and we've used it for about a week, so I can't speak to durability and longevity. It has a 1 year warranty.

Pros:
• Clean, simple design, and decent appearance.
• Nicely thought-out functions for the price.
• Simple installation.
• Comfortable ergonomics.
• A seat lid sturdy enough to sit on.

Cons:
• Reservoir system struggles to keep water at consistent temperature.
• No wash jet width adjustment.

Overall, we are happy to have a bidet seat back in our lives. The balance of quality, features, and price make the SE400 a good value."
"After a trip to Japan, I learned that the bidet is a great invention. Once you get past the American attitude that it is better to smear stuff with dry paper than wash dirty items with water (which we do for absolutely everything else), the bidet makes the most sense in the world. Why pay for endless supplies of wet wipes which actually clog up sewage systems (they do not biodegrade well at all and are becoming an issue).
I have round toilets and I do think the elongated would be a better general choice. The back of the bidet pushes the seat out a bit making the round toilet a bit smaller. My guess would be the elongated toilet become more similar to a round toilet once the the bidet is installed. It is not a deal breaker but something I noticed.
Regarding the install of the bidet it is easy. Getting electric to the bathroom can be a bit more of a struggle if you want it to look good and you will need some electrical experience. Both of the walls behind my bathroom happened to have power in the walls through outlets. I just tapped into those outlets on the other side of the wall and pulled a short amount of electrical wiring to the area of the toilet. Then added a water proof GFCI. The only other thing is if you happen to have those very hard pvc toilet lines, you will probably need to swap it for the better flexible PVC or metal lines. They are only about 5 dollars at your local hardware store, so not a big expense. The GFCI with wire and electrical box will run you 30 or so, so there is that also.
As for use, I have generally been very pleased. So pleased that I added a second one to the guest room. Guests are initially questioning but everyone who has used it as said they would love one in their home. The water pressure is great and you feel far cleaner than using paper (though you will likely use a little paper to get fully dry - the dry feature is great for getting a little water off but doesn't have enough power to get you fully dry). The buttons are all labeled clearly though the ""massage"" button is somewhat unclear to me as to what it does. The one complaint I could foresee is that the amount of warm water does seem a bit low. For me, it is generally fine but sometimes you will notice it running low and the water become colder. This is not enough of an issue to be a deal breaker. If you think it would be for you, I believe the model above this one does have instant hot water generation on demand, so I guess that problem would go away. For me, it is fine. Once the hot water is done, it seems to reheat pretty quickly so you or your next guest would get the full maybe 20-40 seconds of warm water most likely.
To feel clean is great. Seems like such a basic thing but toilet paper is just awful once you get used to a bidet. The only thing that has not been great is knowing in public restrooms you lose this option :-( These are everywhere in Japan and you really get used to not using paper. One of my favorite personal item purchases in a long time."
"I spent a lot of time researching brands, prices, features ease of installation and just about every detail I could think of, and this model summed up to be the best value for the money and the one will all the features your would want without necessarily spending top dollar for another model made by the same manufacturer.

I debated whether if the remote was something that would help, and now that I have been using this one, I am actually glad I did not get one that used a remote as they have a tendency of never being where they are are supposed to be; or you would think they should be. I have a hard eneough time keeping track of the TV's remote, and somehow, under these circumstances, I thought it would not be the best time to find the remote is not where it should be. Nevermind that it becomes something else that can break and adds to the price of the bidet without really justifying any added value that would be comparable. Again, it's not a TV we adealing with here.

Ay to the unit itself, get ready to feel like you have died and gone straight to Heaven. It was extremely simple to install and learn how to operate. If you have grandchildren, at least thus far, they would rather sit on the toilet than play video games. They would also be another reason why a remote would not be a good idea. I am certain it will not be a sustainable source of entertainment as a Nintendo might be, but it certainly has been a hit with them.

As it has been for my wife and I. The only thing I reccomend, is that you have a power outlet nearby that is GFI protected. I know of people that have 10 foot extension cords dragging across the bathroom as in most cases, there are no outlets installed anywhere near a toilet and particularly, if the toilet is in a self enclosed area of a master bathroom as ours is.

I hired an electrician to run a GFI protected outlet and paid less than $100.00 to have it done. Since our bathroom uses GFI breakers in the main breaker box, it was an easy installation with the hardest part being cutting the hole on tile wall where the outlet was placed. Even so, it was a reasonable expense and one that allowed for a clean installation.

Including the drive to my local DIY store to purcahse a longer steel braided water supply line, it maybe took me a couple of hours to complete the installation and have now enjoyed it for quite some time. It really is very efficient and effective. I will likely be installing them in each bathroom in the I spent a lot of time researching brands, prices, features ease of installation and just about every detail I could think of, and this model summed up to be the best value for the money and the one will all the features you would want without necessarily spending top dollar for another model made by the same manufacturer.

I hired an electrician to run a GFI protected outlet and paid less than $100.00 to have it done. Since our bathroom uses its GFI breakers in the main breaker box, it was an easy installation. The hardest part was cutting a hole on the granite tile used on the bathroom walls. Even so, it was a reasonable expense and one that allowed for a clean installation.

I had experienced something similar on a trip to Japan where they had a complete toilet in the hotel we stayed, that would have likely bested this seat. However, I found it difficult to justify the $1,400.00 that would have ended up costing to have the entire toilet replaced... For a fraction of the price, I do not really remember anything that stood out on the complete toilet I experienced in Japan, versus this particular seat assembly. Especially, if you own a decent toilet already.

I would surmise that if you are considering using one on a smaller round toilet, you might find it a bit cramped."
"As another reviewer noted, this bidet will cause LED lights on the same branch circuit to flicker. At little bit of testing showed that there was no problem when the water heater was switched off. Switching the water heater on to any of the three settings caused the lights to flicker.

I got out the Fluke 345 power quality meter and dug a little further. It seems the bidet maintains warm water in the tank by briefly switching a heating element on and off every second or so. When it switches it on, it's a significant current load. It's not on long enough to cause a conventional circuit breaker to trip, but it does cause a brief dip in the supply voltage. Worse, the shape of the waveform is one that LED supplies are particularly sensitive to resulting in very annoying flicker.

I went back to the panel and did a bit more testing. The problem was significant enough that it was visible at the panel end of the branch circuit as well as at the outlet. I suspect this may the root cause for the reviewers that saw GFCI and arc fault breaker tripping as well as the blinking LED light problems.

The water heater design causes enough power quality problems at the panel that I was surprised to see the ETL approval for the unit. Then again, the ETL mark is just for safety. I did not see a CE mark which would require the unit to meet safety as well as electrical interference regulations. I'd recommend buying something with a better design in spite of the ETL approval."
"We have now had the bidet seat for about 3 weeks and feel we can fairly evaluate it now. As this is our first bidet seat we do not have anything to compare it to.
Installation: a piece of cake. Took under 10 minutes. If I wasn't being so cautious it would only take 5. We are lucky enough that the toilet has an electrical outlet nearby. If you do not make sure you figure out where you are getting power from prior to ordering.
Initial Impression: Where has this thing been my whole life! Much cleaner without the use of paper. A nice warm seat. What more could one ask for. Now specifically to this seat the heated seat gets plenty warm. My wife sometimes puts it on high and if she doesn't set it back to medium my daughter or myself think we are on a frying pan. Not in a bad way- just know you have plenty of heat there. Similarly the water temperature is fine on medium. On high we all think it is to hot...well except for the wife. So there is plenty of adjustment available. Water pressure and angle: plenty of adjustment and easy to use. Once you find your sweet spot each person knows where to set it for themselves.
A few weeks in: Initial impression stands. Great product. Quality seems great and shows no signs of any issues.
One item that I want to highlight is not an issue but people should know. The seat has a safety sensor to detect when someone sits in it. That way a person can't press a button and have water flying while not sitting. Great idea. I wager it is set to 50 pounds. Well my 7 year old is small and is maybe 51 pounds. If she doesn't sit exactly right she doesn't set the sensor off and the buttons don't work. Since she is old enough and loves this thing there are directions to turn the safety off. It was as simple as holding a button while plugging it in.
Will certainly be looking at getting another of these in the future."
"This unit worked perfectly for 2 1/2 years. The issue now, is that the spray nozzle is not sure what it's supposed to be doing(?). It extends but doesn't spray, or it stays out after I stand up and starts to spray, which is hilarious to those who don't happen to get wet. The electronics seem to be getting wonky. The drier seems to be working fine and sometimes the back spray works and sometimes it doesn't. I can always hear the seat sensor beep when I sit, so I know that it senses that someone is there. Anyway, we will be purchasing another one of these because I did a lot of investigating before I purchased the first time as compared to other bidets which seem to have lots of issues."
"In the last month I've purchased 4 different types of bidets similar to this and I've learned that with these bidets, sometimes simple can be better. I bought the basic $90 Brondell and was instantly sold. Best $100 I've spent all year. Then I needed another bidet for the main bathroom, which has an easy and convenient plug-in near the toilet, so I decided to get something ""nicer"". After shopping I decided on the BioBidet for around $220. After install I was disappointed in the actual bidet function being very weak and the build quality being cheap compared to my $90 Brondell. So I sent it back and paying another $100 bought this Brondell for about $300. Long story short it's pretty terrible in that is does not do what it says. The water barely gets warm then is cold again in less than twenty seconds. Also the stream was weak as well. I ended up spending $500 or so on a BioBidet BB1000 but frankly all though it's stream is very powerful the ""hot""water is not very hot and doesn't stay warm long. The $220 BioBidet was probably the best for the hot water that seemed to last about a minute. If you are very concerned with hot water a separate heater for that function alone would probably be the way to go. The Brondell products seemed to be sturdier in general, especially the cheaper one ironically.. but the extra money wasn't worth it for the more expensive Brondell functions that don't work at all. This Brondell Swash 400 was terrible for hot water. Back it went. If you can live without a seat heater or hot water the the $90 Brondell and you will have a reliable well built product that does what it is advertised to do."
"I bought a second Brondell SE400 and I'm updating this review. The original review is below. The thing pays for itself with the savings of toilet paper. I'd use 7 tufts before; now I use one to dry myself. I no longer use the water heating feature. I live in the tropics. I don't use the night light. It's overwhelming in my small house. I don't use the fan because it reminds me of my failed attempt to play the flute. (kidding) I don't like the air blowing across my *** to fill the room with what I'm breathing. For me, those 3 features can go away, but I still bought a second one... and there are cheaper ones out there. I like that it has timed squirts, that you can adjust pressure and aim and it's well built. First review ahead ----->
(Man, 6'0, 215 pounds) Boy, this is a game changer! I had some stupid stigma in my mind about bidets that took one trip to a resort at Hapuna Beach to change. Also, with that ignorance, it should be explained thoroughly that the cleaning water DOESN'T come from the toilet. It comes from the fresh water supply from the house. (My wife wouldn't use it until I explained that.)

Installation: Super easy. You need to know that the elbow side of the hose attaches to the seat and the T connector fastens to the tank fitting, not the wall fitting. I did not use teflon tape. That's about it except the seat adapter to attach to the bowl. Anyone with half a brain can look at it and figure it out. But read the instructions. You'll learn how to get the most out of using your new bidet.

Use: I have the volume up to 11. I want as much water coming out as possible. Just guessing, it's like 6 squirt guns and not a hose. The water temp is set to medium and it runs out of warm water about half way through. That's fine here in Hawaii but maybe not for Alaska?! I've been going through 2 cycles of water because one wasn't quite doing the job. Other settings might heat enough water for the entire cycle. I don't know. One cycle on the fan almost dries good enough to call it a job complete but I use a wad of TP anyway do assure that it is indeed complete. With one cycle sometimes it's not.

Night light: Really pretty blue but we have it turned off. It's too much for our little bathroom. I think a better feature would be to have the operation buttons lit up. At least the main ones, F for front, R for rear, V for volume and T for temp.

Hot sauce: I LOVE IT! to a fault, but it's time to say goodbye to blood and Vaseline. Frankly, as you see I can be, that's the only reason I bought this but I'm using it every time. I feel cheated when I have to use the regular toilet in our guest bathroom, and way less clean.

Bottom (haha) line: You see the short comings that I've found but if I could magically change my order to something else that I've researched, I'd buy this exact one again. I actually look forward to going now."
The unit was easily able to be set up with my toilet best quality at a great price range
"I have a Alpha brand one that was probably a little more expensive that outperformes it in every way. The water only stays hot for about 20 seconds which is my only major complaint about it. The aim isn’t the greatest. I don’t really use the heater, Don’t think it’s worth it. The heated seat works fine. The light doesn’t aim centered but whatever. it’s decent for the money although, I’ve had better. If it breaks, I’ll probably try another brand."
"Play Video
 Oh my goodness! I looked for weeks online at reviews for bidets before purchasing this one. It had great reviews and everything we wanted in a bidet being new bideters lol. I wasn’t sure we would love it but thought we could try it. I got it for my significant other for Christmas and we LOVE THIS THING!!!!!! Define going to buy another!!!!! It sprays front or back and also can dry you! 10/10"
"I'll sum it up, having a warm seat for my butt cheeks is nice, having about 30-60 seconds of hot water on my butt is also nice but that's all your going to get. If you just have it hooked up to power you only get about a min of hot water than your butt is taking a dip in the cold section of the pool. I also like the quiet lid so theres no slamming. The bidet also is the secret kind where the head retracts back inside so it doesn't just sit there looking all gross. I am glad I got this bidet. There's a bunch of other features on it but I'm just too lazy to list all of them. So far I do not regret getting it."
"I purchased this seat to replace a previous model from a different manufacturer that I had for 4 years. This one worked for 3 weeks and then started having issues where it would only spray cold water despite the heat being turned up all the way. I contacted the manufacturer for support and was given a set of steps that included draining the unit (which requires removing it from the toilet and disconnecting the supply line), unplugging it for an hour, then plugging it back in, allowing it to refill, and then waiting 10 more minutes for it to heat the water. This resolved the issue temporarily but it has continued to reoccur requiring me to repeat this lengthy process over and over again.

I contacted the manufacturer again. After collecting my proof of purchase and an image of the production plate with serial number, they said that the seat would have to be shipped to them for repair. However, in the same email they stated that I would have to pay shipping both ways, Labor at $49/hour, and pay for the parts. That's not warranty service, that's what I would expect if the unit was out of warranty. Of course this also doesn't address what do I do for a toilet seat while this unit is out for repair.

When it works, it's nice. However, this lack of standing behind their own product and false advertising about a warranty that they do not honor earns this product a 1 star review."
"I bought the Brondell Swash SE400 for a second bathroom which we hardly use. In the master bath, I used to have a Biobidet 1000 and now have a Biobidet 600. The Biobidet 1000 has many fancy functions and we got great service. However, we used only a few of the functions and I didn't like having a separate remote control which tended to break down fairly often. After many years, the Biobidet 1000 shorted out and, rather than fix it, we decided to replace it with the Biobidet 600. We got a great deal on Amazon on this simplified model and we are so very happy with it. It still has every function you would ever need.

In shopping for a third bidet, the Biobidet 600 has increased in price and we couldn't get a great deal so we got the Brondell Swash. It's a fine bidet but not as good as the Biobidet in two respects. The first is that the water stream is a bit less forceful although it gets the job done. The second is that the water temperature does not stay warm as long as with the Biobidets. With the water temperature on the highest setting, the Brondell water is warm for 20 seconds, cool in 40 seconds and a little colder at 55 seconds. With water on the highest setting for the Biobidet 600, the water stays warm for 52 seconds. Now, this is a minor thing and both bidets work well and get the job done comfortably. The Biobidet just has warmer water for longer. However, the cooler water of the Brondell is not so cold that it's objectionable and we never use the full minute of water spray anyway because the bidets clean us in 30 seconds or less.

The Brondell is a fine bidet for the money and you won't regret your purchase."
"Bidets are so hot right now! If you don't have a bidet on your toilet when I come over, we can't be friends anymore. There are a ton of great options depending on what features you want, but I prefer this version with the attached arm (remote controlled ones are pranks waiting to happen). Heated seat, water warmer, air dryer. Step into the future, your booty deserves better!"
love the heated seat must have
"This bidet was very easy to install. It was my first “made in the USA” bidet, and it sure made a difference! Basically, it was out of the box, onto the toilet bowl, hook up the water (leak-free, yay!), and plug it in. That’s it, unbelievably simple. My only gripe? The cord is VERY short, probably for safety reasons, and it misses my outlet by about 3”. After some fooling around with the cord, it now goes very ungracefully up the front of the toilet tank and to the plug. I may end up getting one of those special extension cords, so I can make the cord more out of sight, but I am still thinking about that - I really don’t want to use an extension cord, but I really dislike how that cord looks presently.

However, everything else works perfectly - I just love the heated seat (it’s late Fall here in Michigan) and the comfortably warm water. It’s a far, far cry from the cold water bidet I had last year! But even a cold water bidet is far, far better than no bidet, that’s for sure. If you’re on the fence about getting a bidet - I promise you, it WILL change your life in all kinds of good ways, just do it!"
"I took a month long trip to Japan in 2017 and was enamored with the bidets as most Americans are during their first trip. Every Japanese home and hostel I passed through had a bidet seat and while it felt strange at first I quickly came to appreciate the cleanliness and environmental/economic benefits. After returning home it didn't take long for me to realize I need to buy a bidet seat of my own and thus began my research.

I eventually settled on the Brondell SE400 after weighing the cost and features of a variety of seats. This unit has pretty much everything I need with little that I don't and with a price of around $200 it was an acceptable investment. Setup took all of 5 minutes and after a few minutes for the tank to heat up I was ready to break it in.

The seat is obviously smaller than your standard non bidet seat, so sitting does require a bit more finesse. Granted I am a 240lb American so the fact I can fit at all is testament. The blue lighting that shines down into the bowl makes for a nice nightlight during a nighttime visit and gives your restroom an interesting cherenkov glow. The heating element in the seat gets plenty hot and doesn't take long to do so. The water can get as hot as I would want it but the pressure isn't quite as high as some units I've tried. It does make up a little for this with the oscillation feature that you activate by pressing the spray button twice. The spray is set to go on for two minutes but I have yet to need this long before being clean.

The weak point is the dryer, it is pretty much useless. Perhaps if you're the type who likes to recreationally sit on the toilet with your phone it can work for you but in my case it's just a waste of time as a light lukewarm breeze brushes against my bottom. Some water spray does have a habit of misting the backside of the seat although this may vary based on the user.

I have another toilet in the house I am considering buying a bidet seat for and I may end up just buying another SE400."
This is my third brondell bidet seat. So much healthier and cleaner.
"Nice product but doesn't fit my toilet (too old?) despite the critical toilet dimensions meet shown ones in the Brondell's spec. Actually toilet looks somewhere between ""Elongated"" and ""Round"" but dimensions meet ""Elongated""
The seat has been installed with no problems BUT I can't move it IN farther because the rear part of the seat is too wide and hit the toilet water tank so I couldn't use whole area of the toilet seat ring. See the pictures..
I will try the Round version.."
"Never had or used a bidet before this but what an amazing ""discovery!"" It's a bit difficult to write a review about the benefits and capabilities of this without getting too graphic but I can say it does everything it is supposed to do and leaves one ""clean as a whistle."" (oooh, that's an entertaining simile...)

The single flaw - which is why it missed a five-star rating - is the design. The rear of this seat has a convex curve. This makes it impossible to lock into it's base because, even with the seat's adjustable mounting hardware, it can't be positioned back far enough. It is still usable but a little unstable and the user has to be careful about sitting and getting up.

This forward positioning also has an effect on the jet stream position, physical adjustments to one's seated position have to be made when using. If the back of this seat were flat or concave OR if the mounting/connecting hardware had a greater range of adjustment, the problem would be eliminated. It is only a scant 1/4 to 1/2 inch off the locking mechanism. I realize that my tank is also convex but there is likely a huge percentage of toilets out there with the same or similar design.

For it's usefulness and performance I'm keeping it and may move to a different toilet. Installation is straightforward and mechanically simple. It takes a few times to get used to the initial surprise this product provides, but once that element eases up it's a wonderful alternative for personal hygiene."
"The installation was simple, and took approximately 15 minutes from start to finish. This Swash SE400 Bidet is working well, works as advertised, with one small negative. The negative is that the warm water wash does not stay warm after about 30 seconds. It would be nice if the water stayed warm for the entire length of the wash function. This is minor, and I am otherwise pleased with my purchase. I think it might be a good idea to advertise that the warm water is limited to the first 30 seconds.and gradually changes back to the standard water supply temperature if you let it run its full course. ***Update*** 11/1/21 Bidet is still working great one year later. No issues, and I would recommend it to others who want the multiple functions that it has. **Update 7/19/22** lost the small plastic flap that covers the air dryer vent (perhaps bumped it when i was cleaning). I Contacted Brondell via email at support@brondell.com, and they are sending me the replacement plastic flap. I'm pleased with the service from Brondell (a couple dollars for the flap + shipping and taxes). Their email response and handling of my inquiry was professional, and I will purchase and recommend Brondell products in the future. Still working great over a year and a half since purchase."
Have used these seats for years. This is the first time I had one fail. I hit the button and could hear its little water pump struggling and then it gave and water poured out the side onto the bathroom floor. Thankfully it happened while I was right there. Could have been much much worse. Will replace it with something hopefully less likely to flood my home. Not at all happy with this product tbh.
"I loved this thing for the 20 months it worked. Now it has a leak I can't fix and my bathroom floor stays wet, and the power randomly shuts off. When I unplug and replug it, it comes back on, for a while. I had extreme Ulcerative Colitis and had the J-Pouch surgery. This is where they remove all of your colon and create a new mini colon out of the end of your small intestine. So I go 6-8 times a day, and I give it more use than most. But 6-8 times a day would be usage of the average family per day. It's great in every way. Except, I just wish it didn't break after 20 months."
"The Brondell Swash was easy to install - about 5 minutes longer than a typical toilet seat. The connecting hose is high quality, with well-plated fittings. Likewise, the mounting screws and plate are good, and it was easy to install the seat securely without any tools (as one should)

Regarding usage, I'm completely hooked. I must admit, I was looking for an excuse to invest in a bidet seat for a while, and I'm glad I did. The Swash, with its simple lines, improved the aesthetic of our old, humdrum porcelain round-bowl toilet. The seat covers the difficult-to-clean part of the bowl beneath the hinge on a typical seat, making cleaning much simpler.

I actually prefer not having a remote - one less thing to lose or drop in the toilet, and I have dogs who would consider it a delicious toy. Once you have used it a few times, you remember the button locations, and it's second nature to use them.

The heated spray is adequate, lasting about 90 seconds. The air dry feature is great, though I find myself using it twice to get dry. The blower is offset to the left of the nozzle, so I found myself moving around a bit for...good coverage.

I did try the massage feature too...can't really say that without a stupid teenage boy smirk even though I'm over 40. Not really sure what it's meant for, other than loosening things up, but I'll leave that part up to you.

Lastly, the cool blue LED light is fun. I leave it on all the time just to look at the space portal in my guest bathroom."
"So our daughter was in Japan for 4 months studying at Kyoto University. Then her mom and I went to Japan and travelled for 2 weeks staying exclusively at Airbnb homes. Great experience BTW! Love Japan.

As so many others have pointed out, I also loved the Toto Washlet toilets. I am truly amazed that this phenomenon has not appeared to truly make it to the US. Once you have used one it is impossible to go back!

So I vowed to get one for our master bath when we got back to the states. The entire Toto toilet combo was way too expensive, so I opted to look at the seats only. I was initially going to go with Toto as that of course was what we saw in Japan. However, a number of factors made me change my mind.

First, I was made aware of the other Korean manufacturers such as Brondell. The Brondell was marginally cheaper, but that was not the deciding factor for me. For me, it was a combination of all the great reviews, the wonderfully informative US website which makes me believe I will get good customer service, the readily available information such as the size of their fittings (no matter how hard I tried I could not seem to find the size of the T fitting outlet for Toto), and the additional focus on adding their filter system to the inlet side (since we have well water).

I received the Swash SE400 yesterday and installed it along with the Brondell inline filter this morning. I am kind of a DIY guy, but I must admit that this was the easiest thing ever. No leaks first time, no questions in the assembly, incredibly easy to put together. I activated it and my wife and I have both used it with wonderful results.

So, I will heartily recommend the Brondell Swash SE400 so far. I will see how it does over time and update my review at that time. Don't think you can go wrong!"
"Great for a warm toilet seat. But... you'd better have an electric outlet very close by. I had to run some romex and install a new outlet near the toilet in the bathroom sink cabinet first. But after that, the only worries were installing the plumbing 'tee' and hose to the seat without leaks. They suggest only hand tighten -- not good enough. They still leaked. Had to add about one turn with a wrench to delete the leaks.
The butt and pussy squirter thing works just fine. There are some adjustments allowed to move them forward or back to match your orifices, but they work great, and the heated water is excellent.
But... the big problem: The AIr Dryer! After about 10 seconds, it always pops the GFCI breaker in the bathroom wall from which I down-linked the 120 volt power to the new outlet for the toilet seat!
I Don't know why it pops the GFCI. So.. now, I have to carefully use the bidet functions, and then... when I select the air dryer I have to shut it off before about 10 seconds or the entire unit loses power! And I have to go to the MBR bathroom (opposite end of big house) to re-set the GFCI from which power to all three bathrooms is supplied!"
"I've spent about 3 months of my life cumulatively living in Japan over the last decade and have used many authentic Japanese bidet toilets with the full set of features. This thing is just as good as the fanciest ones I've ever used over there. It's totally worth installing a new outlet in your bathroom specifically to power this thing. Heated seat. Heated water. Night light. Multiple pressure and heat settings. Press the wash button twice for ""move"" mode which moves the jet around as it sprays. Jet angle adjustment as well. And it has a blow-dryer! A roll of toilet paper now lasts for months. I could not be happier with this thing. And it comes at a price that's an order of magnitude cheaper than installing a full-blown Toto Washlet or similar. It's so good that I've seriously contemplated buying another one with my own personal money and installing it on one of the toilets at work.

My only complaints:

- Hot water will run out after about 20ish seconds. It's like taking a shower for too long, eventually it does go cold. It never gets ice cold, though, the heater continues to help even when the hot water tank is empty.
- Although it is designed to be installed on an elongated-bowl toilet, the seat ends up being just a bit longer a non-elongated ""round"" type seat, as the base of the thing takes up quite a bit of space between the tank and the seat.

For the price point, I don't think either of the above warrant giving this thing any less than five stars. Buy this thing, you won't regret it."
"I bought this model to replace a Toto C2 because my spouse, who has cognitive problems, couldn't operate the Toto's control pad. The Brondell has an ""auto"" feature which triggers a two-minute wash/dry cycle, so I'm hoping that dealing with only one button will facilitate use of the bidet.

Installation was pretty easy, and should have been easier, but the connection of the bidet supply hose to the t-fitting was tricky. I had to try 4-5 times to get the metal nut started correctly onto the plastic fitting's threads and I ended up soaked before I got it right.

This model looks good, seems solid, and the mounting bracket was easier to adjust than the Toto's. But it lacks the Toto's ""pre-mist"" and wand sterilization features along with a deodorizer, which added about $100 to the Toto's cost.

Delivery was right on time."
"I've been to Japan 3 times where there's an electronic bidet on literally every toilet and there's a reason why. They're amazing! I decided to bite the bullet and see if I could duplicate the clean, fresh feeling back here in the USA. I watched the short installation video here on Amazon and installed it within about 20 minutes. No leaks, no problems. I do have an outlet near the toilet and just bought some cord holders to attach the cord to the side of my vanity to keep it out of the way and looking neat.

For the price it seems to have a lot of features and the ability to customize the wash to your anatomy and preferences. It does a nice job of cleaning (I'm a dude so I can only attest to the ""rear"" setting). You will have about 45 seconds of warm water before you deplete the reservoir. You can spend more money and get one with a heavy duty heater that will bring tap water up to a warm temp without running out. The 45 seconds is fine for me. The warm air is really nice... especially on a cold morning. But as others have stated it will take a few minutes for it to get you completely dry. You can adjust the water temp, the seat temp and the water pressure. You can adjust the ""reach"" of the cleaning nozzle, you can turn on a cool blue LED that lights the way to the bowl in the middle of the night. There's an ""ECO"" mode that conserves energy if you're so inclined.

I'm happy I spent the money and will probably buy another one for our guest bath."
"Very well packaged, seems well made, very easy to install and easy to understand how to use."
"The bidet is great - when it works. I have purchased this exact same bidet for the second time now. I really liked the first one I got - even though it lasted only two years. Still, I was happy with the overall quality and features. So when my first one broke, I ordered the same one again. I have used the new one less than three months and already the water heater feature isn't working anymore. Since they offer a 1 year warranty I contacted customer support and expected they would offer a replacement... which they don't. They did offer to repair the bidet free of charge, but I have to send it in (which means I have to take it off my toilet, clean it thoroughly so it can be shipped, but a new toilet seat, because I did not keep my old toilet seat from 2 years ago, and then wait for them to repair it and send it back). Not happy!"
"This is the second Bronbell Bidet I have installed in my homes. The first one is about 4 years old and still working great. The second worked great for about 15 months, till it developed a leak. The leak was Not from any fittings but where the unit screwed together. This model only has a one year warranty and i didn't think I needed an extended warranty based on past experience. I guess it's made in China."
"After three years, it stopped functioning correctly. has to be reset in order for it to come on and it gets stuck midway through trying to push the water out.

Sadly, for this product, I would STRONGLY suggest buying a warranty. Even then, they won't replace the bidet, they will try to work out a payment with you. Not a very good experience."
"No sugarcoating here, so if you're easily grossed out, please skip this. I've always wanted a bidet seat so that I can leave toilet paper behind me. The seat is comfortable, and it feels great as you're going, due to the heated seat feature. The cleaning is just okay. There is some residue left over, but still better than smearing things around with toilet paper. I'm not going to knock it for having only like 20 seconds of hot water, I knew that before buying. What made me want to return this seat is the drying feature. It does nothing. First of all, the aim is way off. It aims at my left butt cheek by default, so I have to position myself for the dryer to get the spot that needs drying. Even then, my behind is still wet. I'm not sure how the more expensive seats are such as the Swash 1400 are, for example, but I still need toilet paper to dry off, and clean off the rest of the leftover poo. It kinda defeats the purpose for me. I really want to keep this seat, but I have to be honest with myself since bought it for a toilet paper free experience, and this isn't it. I didn't rate this a 1 star, simply because having a warmed tush while evacuating feels like I'm being rewarded for my high fiber diet. I will miss that."
"My first experience with a bidet was in Japan, (Bidets are everywhere there.) and returning home to a regular toilet seat was a bit of a let down. I received the Brondell Swash SE400 toilet seat as a Christmas gift, I know what you're thinking ""How tacky,"" but you'd be wrong. My husband had no trouble following the instructions and in no time we were up and running. The the nights here in the Midwest can get very chilly and the midnight trips to the potty used to be held until the last possible second, yet with the warm toilet seat and the warm water cleansing, I don't have to cower under the covers any morel. And the cool blue night light means no need to flip the light switch and stumble, with eyes covered to protect them from the bright lights, towards the throne in the middle of the night either. Both the seat and the lid have the soft close, so there is no slamming of lids that come with the regular toilet seats. There are several options to choose from including, how warm you want the seat and how warm you want the water along with other settings to choose. If you don't want to make decisions there is an auto feature that allows you to be cleaned and air dried with the push of a single button. If your bathroom is classy and it doesn't have a Brondell Swash, it's not classy enough!"
"I really do like the bidet and it installed easily. However, I now understand that the geometry of the unit for round toilets and the male anatomy are not as compatible as I hoped. Basically, installing the bidet removes about 3-4 inches of usable toilet seat space from the back side of the seat. This means that you are sitting farther forward on the seat and men may have parts that have to be strategically positioned to avoid touching the toilet seat or rim of the bowl. Had I known, I would have spent the extra money to replace my toilet with an elongated one (2-3 extra inches) and bought the elongated bidet model.

Still happy, the unit does the job it is supposed to very well, with less irritation than using TP. Although I often gently pat with a bit of TP to pre-dry. The heated seat is awesome in Winter!"
"i had fears about how weird the experience would be. in short, its been great. For people with mobility or range of novement problems, this product is a Godsend. The heated seat is really nice, ieven in the summer when your air conditioning vent is right over the toilet. i had pictured this cold stream of water shooting up at my rear end, but no,. you can adjust the temp to our liking. its actually very pleasant and almost relaxing. it's way easier than the conventional methods.i researched products in depth in everylocation and company. This model is the best features for the best price. i hired an electrician to put in the electrical outlet, and the plumber t o do a professional install, which made installation expensive There was an option to purchase installation along with the bidet. i should have looked into that further to see if it would have worked for me. no regrets about the bidet though. nozzle position, water temp, and even water pressure are adjustable.
I've had no problems with it at all, and i would recommend this product to anyone that would benefit from it. I think of it as being useful for disabled or elderly, but other family members like it too. I wish the dryer outlet position was adjustable, but its not. not a big deal, and not really anything to complain about. its also very quiet so it doesn't disturb your sleeping companion in the adjacent room"
"This was easily installed, and functions well. The controls are easy to find by touch, and it makes me feel cleaner in general."
"The product description online does not clearly mention that installation on one-piece toilets can be very difficult, even for someone reasonably handy with tools. Our Gerber one-piece toilet is < 5 years old. The hose disconnect under the tank (to install the T-fitting included with the kit) is virtually inaccessible. I have under sink specialty wrenches and lots of other assorted tools and can’t unscrew the cold water hose-to-tank fitting due to poor clearance and must call a plumber (who may need to actually uninstall the toilet) to make the connection. Furthermore, most people don’t have a GFI electrical outlet behind their toilets so that must be installed by oneself (not a big deal but a squeeze to get to the proper spot on the drywall) or one needs an electrician to do that. We knew we would need the outlet and factored that in to our planning but never expected to need a plumber. Finally, the mounting kit for the seat is not compatible with many one piece toilets including ours, so we had to order a special installation kit for another $8.00 and that was not clear from the “easy-to-install” video. The product may end up working well once we get a plumber to complete it but the buyer should factor in the extras (electrical and possibly plumbing) so be prepared to possibly spend a lot more (in time and/or money) than implied by the product description."
All functions work as described. It washes the rear and front tailpipes with warm (adjustable temperature) water. It also has a blow drier. I prefer a bidet seat that has the control attached to the seat as remote controls tend to disappear over time. This is a very good value compared to other bidet toilet seats that cost more and are no better. These are great for people that have hemorrhoids as toilet paper can be very abrasive and irritating. Highly recommend this as an economical and hygienic a means that eliminates the need for toilet paper. Installation is easy for the homeowner but you will need an electrical outlet near the toilet. An electrician can usually locate a source nearby and wire it to the right place. You should budget a couple of hundred dollars for an electrician if you can't do electrical wiring yourself.
"I purchased this toilet seat/bidet as a cost effective alternative for one manufacturered by TOTO; cost 250 - 450USD less, and has everything you need, that a well made, high quality bidet should have...SC400R came complete, ready to install. The only item it didn't come with, which can be purchased separately, is a feedwater filter. Aside from that, the install process was simple. There is an install video also available for viewing on YouTube. For 268USD, your bidet provides you with both front wash, and rear wash(with water pressure adjust), water temperature adjust, and pulse/massage option, fan with speed and temp adjust, and a LED night light(blue). Eco/Economy mode is also available. I can't forget that it also comes with a heated seat, with temp adjust as well(for those cold mornings/winter days/evenings), and can be turned off during the daytime/summer time.

Operation/Use is simple and self explanatory, and cleaning/keeping this bidet clean is no different. Entire family loves it! I've told my family about this modern art masterpiece during my travels to Japan; they didn't believe how awesome a 'wash toilet' is, until now...

I highly recommend this product; Brondell SWASH SC400 Series R/E if you are willing to save a couple of hundred dollars for a bidet manufacturered by TOTO. Would I purchase another? Yes, Sir...No doubt! Brondell is a total winner for me and my entire family! You won't be disappointed!^_^"
"This is my second bidet seat. I left my old one at my old flat in another town.
The first one I bought was a Novita BH 90 for twice the price as this.
This one outperforms the Novita in almost every way.
It cleans better, it's more sturdy, it's not glitchy (I occasionally have to power cycle the Novita to stop it from acting possessed)

The only real ""advantages"" the Novita has are the auto-opening seat which only served to:
1. Scare the bejeezus out of our cat and
2. Promptly break and not work anyway

The Novita also has unlimited hot water. Which sounds much more important that it is. This Brondell isn't unlimited but there is plenty for a full cycle. And if you want to run another cycle. A few seconds of recovery time is all that's needed.

I would recommend this for sure. One of my favorite features on both is the blue LED light. When I stumble my way through darkness to filter some beer in the middle of the night, I don't have to choose between blasting my brain with light or trying to aim by a combination of sound and luck

The other great feature on both is the heated seat. After you live through a winter with a heated toilet seat there is no going back. Cold seats are for barbarians. But this and every morning for ten minutes will be the best ten minutes of your day."
"We have been using this seat for about 6 weeks and absolutely love it. It makes you wonder how you lived without it, especially when you visit another toilet. I love how much toilet paper we are NOT using anymore as well. It makes me feel good about saving some trees and also offsetting the price of the seat by not purchasing TP nearly as often.

Pros:
Easy Install - took less than 15 minutes!
Amazing Value - tons of features you can't find on a seat for this price: heated seat, heated water AND heated drying!
Easy to use - features are easy to understand so you can get going right away and guests can use it without explanation.
Works Great! - I feel so fresh and clean after each visit. I love the ability to move the spray forward and back to get everything washed away.
Reduces toilet paper - Since you are clean and mostly dry, you only need a few squares of TP to pat dry. So much better for the environment and you feel so clean.

Cons:
The only opportunity for improvement is that a little bit of water spray-back gets on the inside rim of the seat so I will clean this more often to ensure it stays sanitary.

Buy one and you will never go back to TP wiping!"
"We first bought an off-brand value bidet and got stuck with a piece of junk. We then found this Brondell CL510, and at first we were bit apprehensive, but once I got the unit I had it installed in less than 10 minutes. Turned it on, and everything works as it should. No fuss. I am sold. Thanks Brondell, for making it sooo simple. I will buy another from you when the time comes."
"I wanted to say that I just received this item delivered from Amazon Prime. It was delivered in a timely manner and well packaged with no damage to the packaging. I do want to make a suggestion for installers as I have worked a lot with boilers and hot water heating systems. If your supply water is not softened then I would recommend installing a filtration system of some type. These small heaters do not respond well to untreated water containing calcium and iron. They can become unusable in a short period of time. If your toilet bowl shows deposits of calcium and the inside of the tank is rust colored then you may have issues. I have softened water so no worries. I will post an installation video and review the bidet when completed as I will be cutting through marble tile on the wall behind the toilet to install power from a GFCI in the lower basement bath. This way, no extension cords to mess with so you will have a clean install. Watch for my video"
"i got this in august of 2020, and i wasnt sure if i wanted to give this a review yet. here we are, 2022, i'm getting Christmas gifts, and i still use this to this day. i just HAD to go back to this purchase-- i'm considering this as an actual gift!! easy to clean, and the functions are truly perfect. i still have that little plastic cover on the buttons to peel off from when i first bought it. PERFECT in my opinion, definitely a great purchase if you are looking for a bidet to use for 1+ years!!!!!!!!!!"
"I love this bidet. Had a simple one that just ran off the water to the tank. It was cold in the winter time. I got this Brondell and love the heated seat, maybe even more than the warm water. But it is also, so nice. Only complaint is that the control arm is not lit up. You can light up the bowl, but that really does nothing. Using the bidet at night, I have to slide my finger down from the stop button which I can barely make out in the night, to the front spray button."
"I was on the fence about buying a bidet but I decided to ""take the leap"". I have a stomach condition which results in frequent trips to the bathroom which helped spur this purchase and it's been worth every penny."
"Having had this now for about a month, I am more favorably impressed with this bidet than at first. The washing jet is warm enough for me on the medium setting and, at the maximum pressure setting, is sufficient to wash the anus clean. The drier alone will not dry you properly. You have to use a little toilet paper or a small towel first and allow the drier to finish the job. The drier air stream is aimed a bit too far forward, so I lean back on the seat to bring the ass forward, thereby getting the warm air nearer to where I want it.

My installation problem was that I was fitting the bidet to a somewhat small toilet bowl and the toilet bowl tank was not located back far enough, so the bidet seat is located a bit too far forward, even though I selected the round, and not the elongated, seat version. On a larger and elongated toilet bowl, I would probably not have had this problem."
I have had a couple of heated bidet seats and this one is great. It has all of the key features that you need. With these seats it's about being able to adjust things such as water temp and water pressure as well as stream adjustment as everybody's anatomy can be different. The blue led nightlight and slow close lid are perfect touches as well. Best seat for the price IMO.
"I was always curious was a bidet would be like. I eventually did a lot of research on finding a good bidet for the money. Brondell fits the mold of high quality and affordability. I bought the SE400 as a birthday/Christmas gift for myself. My wife thought I was odd I think. When the bidet arrived I promptly installed it. It took less than 20 minutes. The bidet looked great! The lid closes slowly, which I like. I tested all of the features over the next few weeks. I like all of the features, I used way less toilet paper. The bidet does a great job of cleaning. The warm water does seem to dwindle after 15-20 seconds or so but I don’t mind. The dryer does a decent job. I still use a few squares of toilet paper to dry. My wife has also come around and really enjoys the bidet. We like the nightlight as it is not too bright but still works to find it in the middle of the night. If you ever want to try a bidet this is a good choice for you. Brondell really does a great job. I will never live in a house again without a bidet!!"
"We saw these bidet seats at a fancy plumbing shop starting at 400 dollars, found this one for a lot less a gave it a try. I have never used one before so have no other reference but am very happy with it, the light looks cool so we just leave it on all the time, fortunately water comes out warm from the start and even if you run all the warm out of the tank (about 30 seconds) the water nevers gets too cold to be uncomfortable. Spray is powerful but not too much so. Installation was super easy and everything I needed was there other than I had to extend the plug to reach my nearest outlet but that was to be expected. Only downside I can see is due to our toilet being a round one there is a little less seat room than with a normal seat but I am a big guy and still fit fine just have to make sure my business doesn't get hung up on the front edge when getting up and sitting down now."
"This item is not as ""fancy"" as the Toto that I have used, but I am very pleasantly satisfied with this product. Installation was not terribly difficult, though I have to say that the fit isn't all I would have liked. However, that may be that I have a ""non-standard sized"" toilet, so I'll have to let that slide.

The only problem I had was locating the ""Tee Valve."" According to the instructions (and the customer support person I talked to on the phone) it should have been in the poly-bag with all the other parts. I couldn't find it and had to ask them to send a new one.

Then, much later as I was gathering the packaging for disposal I just happened to get a glimpse of *something* lurking in one of the cardboard packaging spacers. When I dismantled the spacer, there it was, the Tee Valve. Very cleverly hidden I must say. I would suggest not doing that.

The function is great. My only complain there as far as user experience is that the wording on the controls is quite small, and you cannot really read them from the - ahem - standard user position. Better to memorize them and come to a comfort level by feel."
"Wow, I'm impressed. I was lead to reopen my inquiry into bidets by ads I've seen recently online. Cheap bidets are being marketed under clever names and with funny advertisements but I figured that if I was getting what I paid for, I should do my research. Enter the SE400. Although priced at two and a half times that of the model that tempted me, it includes features that account for every dollar. Isn't that the point though? To get what you pay for and have an experience that's worth having. The internal water heater means not getting blasted with cold water. The fan actually does most of the drying after use so you don't have to use much paper to dry or soak a dedicated butt-towel. Installation was easy. I basically looked at the parts, looked at the toilet, and 15 minutes later we were set up and working.

There's no going back for me now. This is my new default. I don't know how I went so long without one of these and I with each use I'm grateful to my past-self for deciding to use the SE400 vs the cheaper ones."
"it should be standard in every civilized home :)
I installed it in master bathroom, so only my wife and I use it. I will have to install a proper GFCI outlet close to it, right now I have to use an extension cord to a GFCI outlet
Initially, I installed it in our first level bathroom, but my daughter and my wife said that the visitors would be spooked by it; it is indeed something too personal; I hope that in the future it will be considered normal

I like it so much that it is now the only toilet I am using in the house, even though I have to climb the stairs :)

I like that the control is right there, and it is not wireless; it is not ""soft"", it is a hard plastic, but being warm makes all the difference;"
Perfect sanitation
"This is actually my 2nd Brondell bidet that i had purchased in last 3 years. The first was in store from Lowe's. I love the warm seat, warm water spray and drying capabilities. The bonus was the blue night light, which also enhances the color of the water in a boring all white bowl.
This one i bought just a week ago, Model SE400 is really awesome. The installation was a cake. The water line is tapped off the inlet water to the toilet bowl, not from the wall. So, you have bigger connectors to work with, easier to tighten things by hand and more accessible. You only need a single adjustable wrench to install this unit. It was everything i expected. No disappointments. No risks buying this product online. I previously returned a SmartBidel 1000 unit after testing it for 2 weeks, everything was flaky an their seat didn't get warm enough on a 500W system. Brondell has got my trust now, easy name to remember when it comes to Electronics bidets."
"We bought this to reduce our use of tp. It does. It was simplicity itself to install and took 5 minutes. I had a wall outlet near enough and the plumbing was a snap, first time. Nope, never read the instructions for use either. The controls are clearly labeled in correct English and simple to understand and use. The seat itself is quite sturdy. The lid is thick enough to sit on but thin and bends a bit. It matters not to us. The seat and lid are both dampened in closing, nice effect! So, if you will pardon the pun, the bottom line is, great bidet! As to the above “softness” rating, I do not understand the question. It is all sturdy (and easy to clean) white plastic. There is nothing soft about it. But it is quite smooth. I think of felt or chair cushions as harder and softer, not toilet seats. Oh, the arm is easy to wipe clean too. What would a higher priced bidet have that this one doesn’t? I don’t know and I would easily buy this again."
"Play Video
 I've had this bidet for about 8 months now and the rear wash pressure wash and position wash buttons all stopped working. I contacted brondell and shipped it back for repairs which they did handle at their own expense because I was in warranty when I received the seat back and reinstalled it. It works for about 1 day and then it just broke again. Still waiting to hear back from them again. Really frustrating to be honest.

Update: They weren't able to help me at all and now the toilet is just flashing and won't stop. Again, waiting to hear back from tech support."
"This seat is a great bargain with a lot of higher end features at less the half the price of the top tier Brondell model. It also offers more features than the competitors. I had been researching Bidets for quite awhile and I hadn't found one that had all the features I wanted, so I was saving up for the top tier Brondell, then this model came out and it had everything on my checklist for an excellent price. I purchased it and we have had it a few weeks now and love it.

The only minor cons I have noticed:
-The air dryer is pretty much of no use unless you have 20-30 mins to sit there and let it dry. Some TP still required
-The front wash option splashes water out of the front of the toilet if you are not seated just right because there is a fairly large gap between the seat and the bowl.

Overall a great product at a great price. I would recommend"
I was impressed by the quality and features for the price. I had never used one before. My daughter-in-law has same one and recommended it. How did I live without it for so long.
"Well, easy for me to say how easy the installation was because my hubby is the person who installed it! But, I didn't hear many bad words so I think it went pretty smoothly! LOL! Instructions must have actually been written in American English because they're easy to understand. Very happy with this system and especially happy to have found one NOT made in China! Would prefer that it was made in the USA but had to settle for Korea!"
"A friend of my husband's really talked up having a bidet and was so happy with it (he has a different one) my husband wanted to give it a try. We received this as a gift from our daughter for Christmas. My husband was able to install it easily and really likes it. I have to admit, having a seat warmer has been very nice. I thought having a night light on a toilet was unnecessary and odd but have to admit, it is easy on the eyes at night and useful when trying to find your way around when your spouse goes to bed before you. Overall its been great. Our toilet is round and the round bidet fits a little odd but it works. The round seat is not as comfortable for a man."
"This toilet seat is very good for the price, looks very nice in my new bathroom. I could give it perfect 5 star but I am taking 1 back for it’s drying performance, which is not good at all, it’s like soft air which doesn’t do it’s job. If you are not big & tall you have to adjust yourself on the seat to get better wash. The best feature is that it can not wet your bathroom because unless you sit on it the wash mode will not turn on, perfect if you have young curious guests using it."
Arrived as advertised. Works perfectly
"I discovered these fancy toilet seats on a recent trip to Japan, where they are everywhere (even in porto-toilets), and had to get one for my home. The heated seat is especially nice during the winter months."
"SE400 - Brondell bidet seat review:
I like that control panel is attached to the seat, and easy to reach. Would like to see a LHS control panel for lefties. Water temp and pressure are great, and there are 3 settings. I find the lowest setting perfect. Oscillating option is awesome, as well and front/back washing options . Air dryer I can do without, takes too long, and I end up using TP to dry. I have used Toto bidet seat and this one is lots better. I would definitely like to add this washlet to another toilet in my house, but need a left sided one, so I guess the washlet with a remote control is an option to consider, though it is about $100 more in price."
"I got this for my mom as a gift and she loves it! We all love it! The warm seat is clutch in the colder months and the night light is indispensable for those middle of the night trips to the bathroom. Adjustable water temps makes it great in all seasons. The only issue I have with it is that the jet for the front hits the same area as the jet for the rear. Other than that, it’s perfect! Get yourself one of these and never have to wipe your butt with paper like a peasant ever again."
"Clear instructions. Should have taken only 15 minutes to install, however, the inlet was too close to toilet. Took us several hours to manage to get a tight connection. This is not a fault of the unit, but a peculiarity of my home. Unit performs well, warms up quickly, adjusts well. Would like more than 3 water temps to find the one that is ""Just right"".
Continues to work after 2 years"
I installed this as soon as I finished reading the overall product materials. The installation took approximately 30 minutes and installed very simply and easily as per the instructions and the video that accompanied the amazon page. The setup was again exactly as described. The standard settings work very well and need little if any modification. The spray and the ability to adjust is a good feature. The spray is with good force and works well. The heated seat is of limited value in Texas but is nice on colder nights. An automatic component to the night light (like coming on at night and turning off in the daylight) would be a nice upgrade of the future. The feel of the seat is good and I really like this product.
"This bidet seat has all the luxuries that you would expect: front/rear spray with warm water, night light, and drying feature. The water pressure could be higher for the front/rear spray and there is no way to adjust higher than the highest setting. The move function of the nozzle does make it feel like you are clean when you are finished using though. If you are going to spend $300 on a toilet seat I'd recommend you either pay a bit more for a drying function that actually works or spend less and don't get an electronic one....I also have the $25 non-electric version of this model and I feel cleaner after using that because the water pressure is more adjustable."
"This is my second Brondell washlet, and just like the first one, it's amazing! Bought the first one over two years ago and moving from nasty toilet paper was the best decision ever. Now just bought and installed the second one for my new apartment (with a small round toilet bowl in one of the bathrooms) and this one is just as delightful as the first.

I touch the button and its like the Bellagio Fountains back there ;0)

Highly recommended for sensitive tooshies, the warm water and force air dry are nice touches and the heated seat is a dream in the winter!"
"Unfortunately this item has been malfunctioning since it was received. Upon installation the water pressure was extremely strong and would not reduce, then it began leaking and now it has completely stopped working. Attempt to reach out to the seller was not replied to. Conversations with Brondell have not resulted in anything since 12/04. This defunct product was apparently cleared to be sent back for repairs but no return label was sent and now Brondell is not responding to any inquiries. This is very disappointing and has become a waste of both money and time."
"So my son convinced me to buy a Bidet seat a year or so ago, so I went on the cheap and got one without heat, while it did the job, it was cold in the winter especially, so I started the quest to rinse my rear with some warmer water. Well low and behold up comes this ""gem"", now I already have one of their heated toilet seats (hey I like to be comfortable when I'm doing my business) and it's AWESOME! So when I saw this combo heated seat/heated Bidet, I thought I had found the holy grail of toilet seats. I wasn't wrong, mounted on my toilet, it became the ultimate throne, where not only does this baby warm your cheeks when you sit, but it bathes your rear in a soft warm water bath then gently dries it with a warm breeze, it makes me feel like the true King of the household!"
"My daughter told me about her family’s bidet seat, and so I started looking. Live in a climate where we have real winters, so non-electrical wasn’t an option, need heated water. This is great! So easy to install, I did it myself, 68 year old woman. Super easy to get used to, now I’d never be without."
"Came across this seat at a hotel I stayed at, I instantly thought it was something we needed. My boyfriend loved it. It’s our household staple, the warm seat every moment is so comforting!"
"Just picked up a second SE400!

I wanted to originally purchase the other famous brand, but the SE400 had a better price point for us. It is just as comfortable and full of the conveniences I've experienced in Tokyo. I prefer the control unit attached to the seat as we wanted to avoid issues we seem to have in locating our TV remotes.

Plus features: A cool blue night light, no need to turn on a bright room light late for my middle-of-the-night bathroom visits.

Cons: Related to above, I wish the controls were lite, but my braille skills are improving.

Easy to install. The hardest part was installing the electrical outlet at a spot where the power cord could be attached.

Try one! You'll come to learn how cold and unaccommodating those public seats can be."
"This seat does look different than any other toilet seat. That is because it not like any other toilet seat. Between the heated seat, heated water oscillation and air dryer, any one of these would more than compensate for its somewhat ""handy capped"" appearance. But put them all together in a one button (Auto) operation, wow.

The installation was easy. It comes with a plate that is screwed to the toilet and then the seat just slides onto the plate. Very secure. We originally had an extension cord going to the sink outlet. But after remodeling out bath we had on outlet installed next to the toilet.

As for the price, this seat is a deal! Considering we were contemplating purchasing a complete toilet that costs four time what this seat costs and does the same functions. We are very happy with this unforgettable experience maker."
"We have had this for a little over 2 years and it still works well. We really like it and bought on for my mom. She likes hers as well as we like ours. The features I appreciate are water temp controls, water force control, and seat warmer. It has more features but the ones listed are my favorites. Very good quality"
"So, I've had this for 2 years now. If I had it to do all over again, I probably wouldn't have bought this bidet. First of all, the ""drying"" fan doesn't dry. The only thing it accomplishes is blowing poop smell all over the bathroom. Not a feature. Next, the water temperature is very inconsistent. It might be uncomfortably hot one time, and frigid the next, regardless of how long it has to recover between uses. A sort of potty roulette. Then there's the water pressure; again, inconsistent. Same with the heated seat. There's something definitely buggy about this thing. When it works properly, it's great.
If you enjoy living life on the edge and love surprises, then this is the bidet for you! Me? I think I'll replace it with a bidet with fewer bells and whistles."
"We've been use this kind of toilet seats for years, recently just bought this one, so far so good. We are so used to using this, even wanted to bring it with us when we travel(just wish we could find one small and convenient to bring with us wherever we go)."
"Easy to install, if you have a power outlet near toilet, or can put one in. Reservoir of warm water is not large enough for 2 minutes of spray, but a lot less time is sufficient. Unit is bulky at rear of seat, creating more area to be cleaned. Seat heater and controls are easy to use. I like not having a remote control."
I love this bidet!!! I’ve been wanting one for a long time and finally pulled the trigger. The one i got was for round toilet seats and i was nervous it wasn’t going to fit because our seat seems so small. It fit perfect and the warm seat and water is a game changer. Definitely worth the money. The instruction video it has u go to made it so much easier than reading instructions. I highly recommend this product.
"Given the amount of features packed into this product, the price is actually surprisingly good! Installation was very easy and didn't require any tools, I was able to hand tighten everything and there were no leaks. I leave it in eco mode to save power, and my main worry was that the water wouldn't have time to heat up before use, but that's not the case - aside from first time use (shortly after install, which is understandable), the water was always warm when I used it. If there was one bit of feedback I could leave it would be to double the duration of the air dryer, it shuts off too soon. But it's not a big deal, just press the button again :-)"
"I am very happy so far, my Bidet seat was just installed this morning.
My extra investment so far stands at $120 for the electrical connection,
$100 for installation which included water hook up. I am seriously
impatient waiting for the water and the seat to heat up.
Update!...... I have used my Bidet and am thrilled with it, the warm water is soothing and very comforting.
It takes a bit of effort to position yourself for spot on cleansing, but
I am sure I will get it down really soon.
I am very happy with the lblue light, no more putting the light on and in the middle
of the night and not being able to go back to sleep.
I need this for medical reasons and am thrilled that
it is self cleansing. I am very happy so far."
"Okay, I don't know what we did before we got this bidet seat. When I'm away from home and have to use a regular toilet I leave feeling... well, not really clean. If you have even minor hemorrhoid type irritation, this seat is a must. I really like the ECO mode (it only heats the water and the seat when you sit on it). You don't waste energy heating when you don't need it. Some people complain because the water doesn't stay warm for the whole washing process but that doesn't bother my wife or I. It starts warm and then get cooler. If it started cool it would be a bit of a shock but starting warm and then cooling is not problem."
"We got this as we have a low flow toilet that clogs with a change in the weather. I got tired of plunging it.
This is a super easy set up - we are experienced DIYers, but this requires almost no skill (you need to be able to use pliers and a wrench, that’s it.) Who knew that a warm toilet seat would be so great? My husband, who I thought would not be a fan, also likes and uses the wash function. For the functions you get, this is a real bargain.
Note: you may need to have someone drop a new GFI outlet (on a 15A minimum circuit), they aren’t usually available near your toilet."
"I really love this bidet: it really got my kids into getting cleaner because hygiene is now fun. The best thing is that they are now used to being clean, and they make more effort everywhere, even when a bidet is not present.

Just the boost of hygiene makes this product a ""must-have""; but on top of this, Brondell has a wonderful service support. I recently moved to a new home and my seat didn't fit the new toilet. Brondell was very responsive and proposed to modify it from a ""round"" to an ""elongated"" version for a reasonable price. Since they have a US-based service center, I send my unit and received it modified within a week! Couldn't be happier."
"The product itself has been great, and my wife has loved it for the last 1.5 years. However, just last week, the water stopped heating, and so we call technical support, and spent several hours troubleshooting, and in the end they said that we just need to send it in for repairs, and that since it was outside of the warranty window (1 year) they would take no responsibility for it, and we would have to pay for everything if we wanted it fixed. I talked about it with my wife, and we decided that it didn't quite make logical sense to pay $270 for the unit, and then possibly have it break right outside of the warranty window every 1.5 years, and then have to pay another $150 for the repairs, plus all of the time spent sending it out and being without a toilet seat. I think we will spend the extra money on the higher quality bidets seats from the other company next time, with much higher reliability and warranty reviews."
The blue light might be useful in a completely dark bathroom. I use it to know when I shut the system down. The washing is excellent but the drying while helpful is a bit lacking. The heated seat is nice but not necessary. Overall a reasonable price.
Internal hose attachment broke and leaked within a month of being installed. No help from Amazon since it was beyond 30 days of purchase.
"It worked as expected for three years, and then water started dripping out from below the seat near the nozzle. I contacted Brondell and their recommendation was to send it back to them in San Francisco and basically would cost the price of a new one to have it looked at and repaired."
Easily one of the best purchases I’ve ever made and that’s not a joke. If you’re a guy like me who has to use a ton of toilet paper and spends more time wiping than actually going then look no further.
"I have a dedicated plug for this bidet behind the toilet. The plug outlets in my bathroom are on a dedicated 20 amp breaker. The circuit is protected by a brand new 20 amp GFCI. We are on municipal water, which has a low mineral content.

The first Swash started tripping the GFCI about a month after installation. Brondell customer service sent us a procedure to drain and refill the tank, reset the system memory, etc. We followed the procedure to the letter, and it kept tripping. We returned it to Amazon and a brand new Brondell Swash showed up.

Within 60 days the new unit started tripping the GFCI. I went through the tank purge and system reset and it helped for about a month, but then the unit began to trip the GFCI again. All other appliances on the circuit were removed, and it kept tripping. I replaced the new GFCI with a brand new GFCI and it still tripped. Sometimes it would trip a dozen times a day, sometimes when just sitting there with nobody using the seat.

I sent the second unit back to Brondell and they found corrosion in the tank float switch. They replaced it and sent it back. I suspect that Brondell has a design problem, where incorrect materials were specified and they corroded. If they replaced the float switch with an identical unit, I suspect that it will trip again within 60 days.

Despite good customer service, I cannot recommend this bidet. It has a design flaw, and I'm sure that I'm not the only one who is having the same issue.

Do not buy this bidet."
"We were so excited about this bidet! We've wanted some for quite some time. We did quite a bit of research on features and functionality and this one has a LOT!

The installation went pretty seemless. I had to run a new GFCI outlet, not difficult, and I wouldn't consider this part of the actual installation of the bidet. Once the outlet was ran, the bidet was very easy to install and the instructions were helpful.

We turned the bidet on, the nightlight was cool and very useful. Unfortunately, this product misses on the main bidet features, the water jet and the dryer. The water jet works if you're able to get the right angle and shimmy along the seat. I find myself a toddler needing to go to the bathroom, making weird back and forth motions. Once done, I hit the Dryer button and I get about a minute or two before shut off. Not an issue at all. The hard part is I have to hit it about 3 times before I feel comfortable enough to take a few pieces of toilet paper and finish the drying. The dryer just isn't powerful. You can get warm air which is awesome, but it's like an underpowered fan you'd purchase at the zoo on a hot day.

Overall, we've reduced our toilet paper usage and I'm grateful for that. The money compared to what we got is questionable."
"Product arrived on time and in perfect condition. It was easy to install. I love all the options. Never using toilet paper again. The money you save by not buying toilet paper will pay for this toilet seat bidet. I hope this bidet lasts a long time since I am retired and on fixed income. I can’t see how anyone can totally wipe themselves clean with just toilet paper. You really need water every time you go to the bathroom to get clean. Love this toilet seat bidet! You won’t be disappointed. If I had the money, I would buy another one for my other bathroom."
"This seat does everything it says it does and does it well. The install was simple to follow, easy to do, and quick. The seat and lid are study, well built, and feel like quality. The slow close feature is pretty cool. It easily comes off for cleaning and snaps right back on. The nightlight is a big hit. The remote works and is simple to understand and ""get dialed in,"" the beep feedback is nice and subtle... the text could be a bit larger though. The heated seat is nicer than I thought it would be. In fact, it is quite a shock to sit on one of the other seats in the house, even on a warm day! Wow, what an unpleasant experience, I guess I'll just have to outfit the other bathrooms accordingly... eventually...

So, would I buy this seat again? Yes, but I'd probably go for the model that has unlimited heated water. This model has a tank and the water definitely gets pretty cool by the end of the short cleaning cycle. Also the air-drier is pretty much useless. This is not a fault of this seat or anything, it's just the physics of trying to dry water with a slowly moving waft of warm air, unless you want to run several cycles. It IS nice, after a shower, to sit down and run the dry cycle before donning clothes, and it is really nice on a cold night. Finally, the opening is pretty small, even on the elongated model. I'm a pretty big guy and everything fits and is comfortable, just feels... snug."
"This is a great Bidet. This is the second unit of this model we have. The first one we got a few years ago, is in my wifes bathroom that she uses daily and loves it. He has been urging me to get one for my bathroom and I did the last Prime day. The first one I got was missing a part and had to be replaced. I got it installed Friday, Jan 12. I could not install it myself due to being disabled, but it was easy to install the first one we got a few years ago. I would have gotten one sooner have I known how good it's works and feels and cleans yourself. I recommend it!"
"Okay. I purchased this bidet to replace the inexpensive hot/cold bidet I had before. The old bidet is being moved downstairs. While the old seat wasn't great, it wasn't bad for a $50 either. That was my only prior experience with a bidet and it is what I use for comparison.

The Brondell is one hell of an upgrade from that other bidet and it's worth every penny.

PROS:

1) I read a few reviews knocking the blow dryer in the seat. This was one of the main reasons I wanted to upgrade. In my case, I was very surprised to see how effective the blow dryer is. This feature reduce my TP utilization to zero.

2) When I initially got the seat, I was worried about the pressure. It was nowhere near the pressure of my old seat. Of course my old seat had enough pressure to blow water out your ears. After a few weeks, I've reconsidered my initial impressions. I think this is superior to the high pressure sphincter injection method. With the 'move' feature. It's plenty of pressure to do the job. Sometimes I run it twice. I don't think it's necessary most of the time, but it's pretty enjoyable so I don't mind.

3) I thought the heated seat was a gimmick, but I was pleasantly surprised how comfortable a warm seat is. I usually forget it's heated right up to the moment I sit down. It's quite nice.

4) The blue glow is pretty awesome

Here are a few observations:
1) The heater will definitely stink up the bathroom if you don't flush first. I'm not really sure how effective the deodorizer is. I usually remember to run it when it's too late (after I start the drying phase). This is going to be the same with any bidet with a dryer though.

And now the CONS:
1) The massage option doesn't seem to do anything. I really cannot tell the difference. 'Move' is enough.

2) The damned plastic T-adapter is silly. I cannot keep the damned thing from leaking no matter what I do.

3) The water cools down before the cycle is over. I wouldn't say it gets cold, but it cools off a little.

None of those things are enough to make me knock an entire star off. If I could remove a half star (to 4.5), I would. The seat is so good in the PRO department though that it's definitely something I would recommend.

If you haven't had a bidet, you will quickly learn that not having one is a real problem. If you have a cheaper bidet, you will want to upgrade. This bidet is a very good value and I highly recommend buying it."
"So we got our first bidet seat for xmas 2018. It was a Brondell E600. Just to set the stage...I am 6'3"" and weigh about 270lbs and my wife is 5'8"" and weighs about 160lbs. We really liked everything about this bidet with one exception. It has a water tank with heater and the warm water would run out within about 15-20 seconds even though most everything I read said it would last 40-60 seconds. Now, it really only takes about 10-15 seconds of washing to get the job done BUT...I like to let it go a little longer just to make sure it's all nice and clean on the ole bottom so we would run out of warm water most of the time. Due to this, we decided to move that seat to our kid's bathroom and order another one for me and the wife. Wifey said that the Brondell E600 also didn't seem like it hit the right spot on her front wash and she had to wiggle around a bit to get that done but it wasn't a deal breaker for her because she liked everything else about it. We started shopping around again and decided on the Biobidet BB-2000.

Biobidet BB-2000 - This seat has a lot of features but we felt like the quality of this seat was not as good as the Brondell. We also noticed that the seat did not stay very warm. It seemed like it was just about room temp all the time, after you sat down for about 30 seconds you could feel it start warming up. It almost seemed like it was in eco mode all the time no matter whether it was set to low or high. It did seem to have an endless supply of warm water no matter how long you let the wash cycle run. I ended up contacting someone at bidetking.com and asking about the seat warming and was told that they have one in their office and it's the same way. We decided the cost was too much to just settle so we returned it and have now ordered a Brondell swash 1200.

Brondell Swash 1200 - waiting on delivery so can't say at this time but feel confident we will love it.

Summary:
After owning a Brondell, a Biobidet and a Alpha JX we have decided that of them all we liked the Brondell brand a lot more. It just seems like the quality is better. The seat is nice and toasty at all times even on the low and medium settings. On the Biobidet and the Alpha we noticed when you get up from the toilet the seat wants to lift up with you. That did not happen on the Brondell. Seems like that is due to the heavy dutyness (don't think that's a real word) of the seat of the Brondell. The lid of the Biobidet seemed very flimsy and weak. The Alpha was better in that regard. The Alpha seemed to clean the worst of them all that we've tried. This is a significant investment (well worth it in our opinion) and you should be completely satisfied since you will be using it daily. We truly believe based on experience now that the amount of toilet paper we will save the seat will pay for itself in 2 yrs or less.

Obviously, there is a fair amount of personal preference with an item like a bidet but for us, we think the Brondell brand is significantly better quality than all the others we tried. I can also say that I used to travel to Japan quite a bit and they almost solely use Toto brand there so I have tried them also and the Brondell brand seems everybit as good as a Toto and Brondell seems to have more features for less money than Toto.

My wife said that both the Biobidet and the Alpha did a better job washing her front parts but I believe that's because they both have 2 separate wands (one for the rear and one for the front) which allows for better washing of a ladies parts than just having one wand for both like the Brondell E600 we had first. The new Brondell swash 1200 we have ordered has 2 wands so we are expecting it to wash her front lady parts as well as the Biobidet and Alpha.

No matter which one you choose, if you have never had a bidet seat, I think you'll find it's a game changer and you'll wonder how you have gone so long and never owned one. We will never be without one again. It works so much easier and better than toilet paper and/or wipes. Is better for your sewer or septic system and the environment. The Brondell washed so well that even after the wash you can wipe with toilet paper and find the paper will be completely clean! Other than using the single piece of toilet paper to dry off with, you wouldn't need to wipe at all. That reminds me, the dryer function on them all is pretty much worthless so don't let that be a deciding factor in your evaluation of any of them. Oh, and my wife really likes the blue nightlight function on the Brondell too. Hope this helps anyone who is shopping to help you make a decision and get the most bang for your buck."
"Adjustable temperature, heated seat on cold nights, and quiet flush."
"I gave this Brondell 5 stars but I really want to give it 4.5 since it's close to being excellent except for a few minor points.
The first one being that the warm water tank or supply is a little too small. As in that if you let it do its automatic cycle of 1 minute cleaning and 1 minute of drying, you do end up with cold water being sprayed on your bum. 20 to 30 seconds is nice warm to hot water, after that it quickly turns to cold. Granted, I have it at reasonably high pressure to get myself thoroughly cleaned so it probably goes through the warm water more rapidly.
The second is the hot air dryer. It's nice, but not exactly powerful enough to get you dry, even after 1 or 2 minutes of hot air. So either you need to use a few sheets of toilet paper to absorb part of the wetness followed by the dryer or suffer a little bit of a wet behind when you finish.

Having said this, it is an excellent product. Easy installation, anybody can do it. It gets you cleaner than you can ever get with toilet paper in a much more hygienic way.
Nice extra features like the air dryer and deodorizer are, even with a flaw, excellent.
Absolute luxury when you get it and you will wonder how you ever went without it."
"I didn't have a chance to install it right away, I was in and out of the hospital. Finally had it installed 7 months ago, and at first I loved it. I am disabled, so it was a God send, only one arm works, and it has a torn rotor cuff that won't heal. Then issues started coming up. At first, 2 months in, the LED light failed, and then the remote stopped working at all, so it was a reach around back to activate it, and all the charm was gone, only 1 setting, rear cleaning, no amenities at 4½ months, during the next month, the heated water went out, even though I used Brondell filters @ 3 & 6 month replacements. It sure was cold, painfully to say the least. Then a awful sound started coming out at 5½ months a not-normal grinding and water spraying in a tube sound. This was followed by either no water at all or a weak stream. Now I have to unplug it and only plug it in as I sit down, wait for the grinding to stop, then a beep. And 1 out of 3 tries average will produce a very weak and ice-cold wetting of the bottom, no spray, sometimes as short as only 8 seconds. So many great reviews and so much comparing one to the next, and now it is DEAD. It will be sad to go back to having to ask assistance from my Home Care Worker... nobody wants that, believe me. Buy a more dependable unit, ""don't get caught with your pants down"""
"Ok...this could be a long review but I will keep it short. For many years I have suffered from the ravages of serious Crohn's disease and subsequent ""backside"" issues...the details of which you do not want to hear about...believe me. Suffice to say that I typically use the toilet an average of 12 times a day! I have traveled in Japan many, many times and have wished to have a bidet toilet seat of my own. Initially, I gave up on the idea of buying one there and converting the amperage to the US. And then when they became available in the US they were pretty expensive and I didn't know if they would help.

Recently, my doctor suggested that a bidet would be a big help in my struggles against pain, chafing, bl---ing, etc. So I started the search. I read tons of reviews and bought what I thought was the best fit for me. All I can say is...this Brondell Swash SE600 is absolutely AMAZING...both in how it looks, works and as the answer to my wish for relief. I installed it easily in about 20 mins with no tools. It worked perfectly from the very first and it has made a huge difference. Heck...if I didn't have the other issues, it is fantastic just for the pure pleasure of it. Its construction is sturdy, attractive and is a nice added improvement to our master bathroom! The quality for this price is great.

The only thing that I would wish for in this product is that the remote would be backlit or illuminated somehow. In fact, the blue nightlight obscures the words on the remote that are printed in blue. Otherwise...great item!"
"I was always skeptical of bidets, thinking them frivolous. Then I broke my elbow and taking care of my personal needs became difficult. My doctor suggested getting a bidet and I'm glad he did. Not only does it make personal care easier but I feel cleaner and fresher. I am thrilled with the purchase and am planning to replace for three other family members."
"Update: 11/11/23. Higher powers reviewed the situation and decided to honor the warranty beyond the 1 year period. Product was replaced promptly and was been working well for over a month currently. Hats of to this organization for standing behind their product, valuing quality and caring about a long term customer relationship over quick profits.

(Original post)
Product worked adequately for just short of 1 year. Shortly before one year of use in the least used restroom in our house, the unit stops working. The call to the service center is denying the warranty, claiming the guarantee is only valid for one year from purchase date, not the date I actually received the product and had time to install and start using. Do yourself a favor and consider alternatives, even if it’s costs more, it’s better than paying $400 for something that won’t last past a year. Fool me once, I won’t be fooled again."
"Sadly, I must give this bidet a poor review. I have purchased 2 swash 1400's (one for a previous house and one for the current house) and they are so wonderful, I decided to purchase another for the guest bath as well. Since it is for a less used bathroom I decided to save almost $300 and get the se600 ....how much worse could it be??? First, it came with the cheapest plastic valve I have ever seen and woke up the next morning after install to discover the bathroom flooded. I had to go to Home Depot to purchase a proper brass valve and all is right again. Second, no matter how hard you try, the stream is way too sharp and actually hurts a bit. It cannot be adjusted any softer. And thirdly, it only gives you about 20 seconds of warm water before turning almost cold. I regret not having spent the extra money and gotten the 1400 as it is without a doubt the best bidet toilet seat there is. Not even the Japanese could do it better."
"This is a touchy subject for many Americans, butt (pun intended) this product is great. Being a country boy and being of an age whereas I can clearly recall using the ""outhouse"" (we didn't have an indoor toilet in our house until I was a 10), using a bidet is pretty darn close to sacrilege. Nothing that a true red-blooded American Boy would use. Well, WAKE UP AMERICA! ... The days of damaging your rotator cuff while reaching behind your back so you can smear your poop around your backside, can now be put behind you... literally! I don't care what that perverted family of Charmin Bears say, you can never get really clean by wiping. I don't care how much TP you use.

Now imagine this scenario... Nature calls and you are lured to your throne by the mystical blue glow of soothing LED lighting emulating from the bowl. (Kumbaya playing in the background). You tush settles softly onto the seat that is already preheated to just the perfect temperature. Then, as the unloading begins, you catch a whiff of a disturbing odor... Wait! No worries.. just touch the Deodorize Button on the remote control and all those obnoxious smells are immediately devoured by little activated charcoal crystals stored away in your arsenal of tools. Then, the off-loading job completed, you are ready for (what used to be) the dirty work. Nay, I say. Simply push REAR on the remote and you hear a motor operate, then after a few seconds of blissful anticipation... a gush of warm water flows into and onto your business end, and after pushing the MOTION button, the water flow gently begins moving back and forth to dislodge and eliminate all stubborn remaining material. The flow doesn't feel like it's on the ""sweet spot"" you say? No worries... simply adjust the LOCATION buttons for precise aiming. (Gee! It's just like playing Space Invaders!) After two minutes this watery enjoyment, it's time to flush away all the nasty stuff and leave this pleasure seat. But WAIT! What about that water that's still dripping from my backside? Fear not Grasshopper! There's more! Push the DRY button on the control and Holy Crapp!... a flap opens up and warm air is flowing on and over the fanny to evaporate away any remaining evidence that anything at all had ever happened here! Happiness at last.

* So seriously, the only thing that could be better would get one of these seats that has endless warm water. This model's tank only holds enough warm water for about 15 seconds. After that, it's only room temperature, at best.

* The lid for this seat is rather thin and flimsy. I'm afraid to sit on it as I'm pretty sure it would break.

* I have no idea how well the feminine features on this seat work.

For the price, this model has the best assortment features, and so far, (only a month), everything is working well. I recommend it."
"When the unit came in I was able to install it quickly, and it worked great...for 1 day. The second day the unit kept shutting down during a wash cycle. I reached out to Brondell for warranty repair and they said they would give this priority service. I would like to say that 3 weeks turn around time does not feel like priority service; I believe that standard ground shipping plays a big part in the long time.

I repackaged the unit in the box that it came in with the supports that it originally had expecting that it would do fine during shipping. When I got the unit back it was no longer in the original box. Upon opening it I found a sticky note stating ""unit was received smeared."" Pulling it out of the box I found that the logo has been rubbed across the top of the unit staining it blue, and that the unit has multiple scuffs and scratches (picture shows the ""smearing,"" but the other scuffs/scrapes on the unit would not show on the pictures). Essentially a brand new unit that I have owned for all of 2 days looks like it is 10 years old now. My wife and myself are incredibly upset that we spent $400 for something that now looks like we should have only paid $50 for. At least we got a sticky note saying it's not Brondell's fault our unit now looks... For the record, treating your customers with indifference leads them to no longer being customers.

As far as it being a bidet, it works just fine after the repair. It will do exactly what the manufacturer says it will do. However, as far as the company is concerned they fell flat on their face. Their lack of caring about quality has left me incredibly bitter against them. Every time we look at this unit will be a reminder of this horrible experience and will give us the feeling we just wasted $400. Do yourself a favor and spend a bit more money on a company that will provide a quality product with customer service that matches."
Truly a blessing!
Great amount of options we now have two of these the first one is more rhan a year old and has went through many cycles.
"I had to have an electrical outlet installed near the toilet that was the only difficulty. Otherwise, easy to install. Overall I gave it 4 stars because the fan feature doesn't dry well and only pushes poopy air up into your face. The deordorizer feature works moderately well. Next time I'd get the model 300."
"Best investment I ever made in my bathroom! Once you get a bidet you’ll never want to go without one again. I have been using it for about 18mo now, and it is still working just fine. Some features are pointless (the deodorizing fan and air dryer are basically useless in my opinion), but overall it’s been more than worth it. The heated seat, warm water wash, adjustable movement and pressure, independent remote control, and nightlight are its biggest selling points. For the price, I don’t think that I could have done better. It does not totally eliminate the need for toilet paper, I still use a small amount to dry, but it greatly reduces the amount used and leaves you feeling so much cleaner.

**Caution for female users** Be careful with using the female wash function as I believe it may have contributed to a UTI. I used the female/front wash function for several months with no issues, but developed a UTI after about 5mo (I’ve never had a UTI before, and using a bidet was the only different thing in my lifestyle). It’s possible that bacteria was forced up the urethra with the force of the water stream, but I can’t be sure that it was the cause. Since discontinuing use of that particular function I haven’t had any further issues."
"This bidet is great! All of the features work well, water pressure, water temp, seat temp, dryer though we don’t really use it, everything about this is great. We previously bought 2 others around this price range and didn’t like them nearly as much as this one, the features on the others didn’t work as well as this bidet does. It’s great"
"Great seat, bidet functions great, the night light is awesome for guests, the warm seat makes you wonder how you put up with cold seats all your life.
But the bidet motor failed after about three years out of warranty period. For the price point, the product should have a 5 year life span at least.
With that said, purchased another one, would be willing to pay for extended warranty if it was available, as long as it had immediate ship out of replacement with postage paid return of old unit for their review and disposal. Only the more expensive units have the extended warranty...."
"Having never used a bidet, I wasn't sure what to expect. After using it for a month I have to say it was a good decision. It's nice to know my hands are as clean when I get up as they were when I sat down. Also, living in northern Michigan, the warm water, air and seat are much appreciated. As for the product, it appears to be well built with quality components. To install it, I just followed the video. It was easy, straight forward and I think it took about a half hour. The remote is a nice feature and works as expected. The only negative I have is the massage feature. I guess it really doesn't do anything for me, but maybe others find it a benefit."
"I've never used a bidet, but I'm having back surgery and can't bend or twist for 12 weeks. How do you keep yourself clean without twisting? I know they make toilet tongs, but that's an easy way to end up with another mess to clean. When I tried this bidet toilet seat I was pleasantly surprised. Cleaned without twisting, and with warm water, and then warm air drying all my fears about keeping myself clean were gone. The seat warmer is a delight on cold mornings and the remote control makes sure I don't have to bend and twist to operate the seat. The warm water wash doesn't last for the whole wash cycle, but even as the temperature drops it never gets as cold as the 55° temp of the water right out of my tap. So it's still a great experience. My granddaughter has a bidet toilet seat from a different manufacturer. When she tried mine, she told me that she'd be talking to her husband about her experience using this system, as it was much better that hers."
Overall it works well. Minor items like figuring out the control changes. It does what it is designed to do
Purchased this bidet as an upgrade for a very basic cold water under the seat bidet. I've been wanting to do so for some time. I should have never waited this long. I'm not sure how I've lived 50 years of life without a bidet like this. Brondell is most likely the best option at this price point. This is a quality bidet with every feature I wanted. The heated water lasts long enough for each use. The heated seat is unbelievable during the winter months. The water pressure is good. I really have nothing bad to say about this thing. Oh and installation was a breeze. Get one....now.
"The Brondell Swash SE600 bidet toilet seat is well-designed, sturdily built and has many features. The installation instructions were clear and concise. The hand-held, wall-mounted remote controls the many features and functions. I am pleased with this purchase and would recommend this product. It is not the least expensive bidet toilet seat but is well worth the money."
"I have had this seat for about 3 years now. Basically, when everyone was rioting over TP when COVID hit, I ordered this and haven't gone back since. Does a great job and overall I would say I have been happy.

But, (no pun intended) there is a significant flaw with the water line connection. The connector is very shallow, and tends to slip on the plastic threads of the seat. Hand tightening meant it had a constant leak, dripping every 5 seconds or so, so you have to tighten down with a wrench, which just jammed the threads up. It was fine for a couple of years but now the threads won't hold and the line pops off, spraying water everywhere. I just got done using a shop vac to clean up the water all over my bathroom floor."
Would not recommend this product!! Didn't last a year!!!!! Had to send it back for repair twice!! They should have replaced it when I had to send it for repair the second time but we were told they do not replace them no matter what! I think for the cost and having it to stop working twice they should have replaced it with another new one especially since it was still under the 1 year warranty!! I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS COMPANY OR ITS PRODUCTS!!!
"The heater failed on the SE600 after 3 years. I contacted the Company directly . After complying with numerous requests for detailed purchase information and requests for a prepaid shipping label---I was advised that I would have to pay for shipping and return of the item to me after repair. Beside paying shipping there would be a minimum charge of $150.00 and a repair rate of $45 per hour plus the cost of parts that could be $60.00 or more. They should have disclosed these costs in my very first call instead of asking for repeated information on the unit that was purchased through Amazon initially.
I will now scrap the unit since the charges are only marginally less than a brand new unit. Their full warranty lasts for only 1 year--if you buy one and it fails after that period---good luck with getting it repaired."
"There is nothing to not love about this bidet! It is very easy to use and I definitely suggest buying this one because it has everything you could possibly need and more. Just sitting on a warm seat is heaven in itself. The features are easy to use and I don't know how I survived in life without this. I have been wanting a bidet for a long time, and this has definitely lived up to its quality and pleasure. Just think you will save on costly toilet paper, plus the biggest thing is that you don't have to touch anything down there so to speak. It's almost germ-proof. I think every home should have one of these. I wish you made a little seat for my three-year-old grandson. Even though this was a little pricey, it is well worth the money to say the least! I just hope it lasts for a long time because now that I have it, I don't want to be without it!"
"I'm having total shoulder replacement next week and since my left arm will be immobile for a minimum of three weeks. I decided this was the best remedy for my hygiene needs. I researched many brands and decided on this one, it has all the features I want, and at the right price.

It was easy to install just take your time an read the installation instructions carefully. Obtaining the most comfortable settings will take some time because there are so many options and combinations. I didn't find any settings that were uncomfortable.

The only cons I can think of is that the electrical is too short but an extension cord solves that problem. Frankly, if the cord was six feet long, my receptacle might be eight feet away so it's not a design flaw. The air dryer won't completely dry you but it's a good start. The warm water is somewhat limited but my well water temperature is not too startling.

I'm very pleased so far and would recommend this to anyone who wants a good value."
"The seat could fit a bit better. The spray splashes be onto the rim of my round Koehler bowl, so needs to be wiped after use.
Other than that…it is a winner !
I am thinking of purchasing as a Christmas gift for my family members!"
"Nice bidet, good features. a bit uneven in heating so far on the seat. Very powerful stream. My husband is extremely happy. The part I'm happy about is it's quiet. We had a Toto for 7 years, and while it was excellent in many respects, it was noisy because they all have fans. I could no longer stand it, even though it was still working, the fan just got louder and worse sounding. This Brondell is very nice, works well so far (we've had it a month now)"
"Life changer. I’ve had a lot of abdominal surgeries. I spend a lot of time on the toilet. I was constantly in pain from wiping too much, sitting too long, or simply having to go so often. This Brondell has helped me so much. No more irritation from wiping too frequently, no more cold seat in the middle of my Colo winter, so much more hygienic.

This was the best one I could afford, and I’m totally happy with it. If there are cons I’d say the night light is too bright, the lights on the flimsy feeling remote don’t always work. A lot of people complain about the dryer and deodorizer don’t work but I don’t really care about these options. Come on how long would you have to sit there with a fan and get completely dry; it’s an unreasonable expectation."
"I have tried many different bidets leading up to the purchase of this one and this one by far the worst of what I have tried. There are Many issues, the worst being spray so powerful and small (think 0 degree pressure washer nozzle) the it hurts even on lowest setting for rear wash jet front wash jet not as bad but still bad and not enough adjustment to make that nozzle hit rear, second water barely luke warm even on hottest setting, third oscillating or “Massage” function range of motion way to small still have to scoot around the seat to get jet to cover total area needing cleaned, fourth remote control only seems to work intermittently have to hit buttons multiple times to get seat to activate it won’t start rear clean with out first hitting front wash for some reason"
"This is my first real use of a bidet and my first bidet purchase. Overall, this is a great and well built product. The remote is amazing and easy to use. However, I feel the dryer function is not as expected. Additionally, the warm water feature isn't as vital as I thought before purchasing. This does not in anyway give me buyer's remorse. I would recommend and buy this product if I had to do it again. The installation was simple and easy. The recommend three way value and cfc extension cord are a must buy."
"My husband ordered this for his upcoming back surgery. I was a little hesitant, but anything to help him being independent while recovering I was all for.

What a nice surprise! Once you get used to the water hitting you, its really great. The warm seat was cozy. You do have to adjust the water temperature and your position while sitting but once you set it its done.

The light is bright at night so we may turn it off.

I would higher recommend this product if you want to cut down on toilet paper and want to be squeaky clean!"
"Where do I even begin with this? I know you're sitting there thinking that 400 bucks is a good chunk of change for a toilet seat, I was in your shoes once. But as a big man (75in and 300 lbs) I used to go through a lot of TP and on a hot day, sometimes that just isn't enough. This seat does everything you can possibly want for a toilet seat. The jet is adjustable in position and water temperature. The seat heats up very much and the LED nightlight is really great. I just moved into an apartment and bought a new toilet just to have this in there.

My only warning is to MAKE SURE you measure your toilet for elongated or round. You can go to Lowes and get a 100 dollar toilet that this will fit on if you're not sure."
"This was a really good bidet, and it introduced me to the world of bidets. I will never go back. I will always have a bidet, but this one broke after a year and now I have to buy another one… but while I had it, it was excellent, had great features and worked really well… but it broke and it doesn’t work anymore and I can’t fix it and so that’s why I’m giving it two stars because I have to buy another one now and I’m not going to get the same brand because I don’t like when things break because it means I have to keep spending money."
"I exchanged a less expensive bidet which had short circuited, and though I was upgrading by purchasing this Brondell. The PROs on this one are that it has a remote control, it generates its own hot/warm water, and the fit is much better than my previous bidet. The CONS are that it does not generate very much hot/water and when it runs out you must wait 4 minutes for it to get enough to continue the wash, It decides whether you want a front or rear wash first, the remote is very finicky, one page of the manual refers back to the same page which is confusing, all of the parts are plastic as opposed to metal on my previous one, there is no male/female button, and I cannot find a fuse they talk about in the manual other than the one in my apartment. With all of of this taken into account I would NOT buy this bidet again. In fact I would not buy any self water heating bidet at all, assuming it would be guessing at the volume of water needed for each wash."
"The use is obvious, what is not to like?? Don't know how we ever got by without this awesome Swash. The warm water and heated seat are a comfort on a cool morning. You will love this product!."
"There is nothing not to like. Great product. Love the warm seat and water. Love feeling really clean. Love that it doesn’t look like a “machine” and that it only took an hour to hook up the first time and less the second time.
Yes, this is our second bidet (identical to the first) because we wanted one on each toilet. Actually, we also got one for my daughter and her partner at her request. So this is our third purchase of this bidet."
"Am now a toilet snob ! Will wait till I get home to go ! Warm water wash & heated seat. Was easy to install, several months ago. Added a filter in water line because our city water is full of minerals that will plug up the nozzles. Also replaced the plastic T with a metal one I found on Amazon."
"Just received my brondell se600 as expected, my electricity was ready so, it took me only one hour to completed the installation.
I looked at a lot of different manufacturer and models and the se 600 was the winner because of price / value.
The only one for tha pize that offered deodorizer, night light, warm water, warm seat, warm air.
First the con:
Oscillating option weak, does not feel really the difference
Length of wash not big difference between the 5 options
Deodorizing built in and cannot change the deodorizer for different scent, this is the only big sea pointing point
The pro
Had just got a back surgery and the brondell help a lot, no twisting, no reaching.
Does the work very well in less than 2 minutes and, make you feel totally clean
Like the product a lot, easy to install and does. What advertise for a good prize compare to other options.
Will recommend to everyone
I was not compensated to write this review in any way"
"This unit is great. First and foremost when I am done with my business I am cleaner than just a routine wiping. I can ride in a vehicle or on a bicycle for hours without the discomfort of knowing and feeling whats going on down there having only wiped. If you are like me it is imperative to shower after doing your business before starting your day but sometimes you have to go before you go and the Swash makes things bearable for the times you simply cannot properly wash before going about your day. I save toilet paper, have a warm area for my bum to rest, a nightlight, and an adjustable spray for ultimate cleaning. This unit is easy to hook up, easy to clean, and a great conversation piece. I am writing this on my new furniture knowing it is safe from unmentionables that perhaps could have slipped through the cracks of just wiping with toilet paper."
"My first Bidet. I always wanted one and This seat is perfect. I initially wanted to spend a little less but after spending a lot of time researching
decided this one was the best for me. I wanted a remote control because I'm very left handed and most seats seemed to have the controls on the right side. Also felt a remote would be more efficient at night . The seat works beaufitullly. Love the blue color of the night light. A warm seat is
much appreciated in the winter. The options on the remote easy to use and still experimenting with them. I have nothing negative to say. The dry option doesn't thoroughly dry but imagine that's the same for all the bidets I've seen.
The seat is a good size and comfortable and looks good. I use a lot less paper and feel very clean. Really happy I got it."
"Easy to set up. High quality product. Does everything you’d expect it to, plus many options. I was sold on the first use. I have a round toilet bowl. I believe it would be optimal with the elongated bowl. The spacing is a little tight when you sit on the round. So, make sure you set the bidet as far back towards the toilet tank as possible. Overall, I am very pleased with the purchase."
"After reading a number of reviews I decided on this bidet as the best one for me. It has all the necessary features without being overloaded with unnecessary ones like motorized seat. It was reasonably priced, came well packaged, was easy to install and worked as I expected. I would purchase it again."
I started Using a bidet about six years ago… I started with the 300 and now the picture above is a 1200… I just ordered the 600 for the air dryer… My ex-wife bought me my first bidet And I’ll never ever go back to toilet paper. To me the Brondell is the best. I have used many other manufacturers and have never found a better bidet…
"Purchased July 2022, installed late September 2022 and I loved it! Then starting June 2023 problems off and on, nozzle not extending and then not retracting completely. then no water that was fixed by changing exterior filter early and unplugging the unit while we were away for 10 days in September. Success! When we returned and plugged it back in it worked perfectly - for 5 weeks and now nothing. Nozzle extends but no water spray. Exterior filter is new, interior filter is clean, nozzle is clean but other than a nice warm seat the thing appears dead. Very disappointed that overall this worked for maybe 12 months ."
"My original Brondell stopped seat heating at 13 years so decided to replace it with a newer version. Bad Mistake! Seat started leaking from central portion after just about 13 months. I finally called a plumber at 14 mo and he definitely said the leak was coming from the central part of the seat. I suspect the tank either has a leak or the connection to the nozzles. I paid the plumber $200. for a 1 hour consultation and to remove the plumbing connections to the seat. I have been in contact with the company sending all the required documentation etc. other than the requested moving of leak in action - kinda an amazing request!
I am getting written responses but sure is taking a long time & think I should purchase from another manufacturer. Not happy with the service. Too bad - the original one was spectacular. This has been so disappointing!"
"I had surgery in my wrist and elbow on left side back in Dec with a follow up surgery for my right side last week. Prior to my right side surgery I was really worrying about ""bathroom essentials"" getting done properly since my left hand is still not fully functional and right hand soon to be out of commission. I am a healthy size woman with T-rex arms so believe me when I say this SE600 was a life saver!!! Easy to install, easy to use and once you sit on the warm seat you are hooked for life. I have invited my entire family and friends and Facebook to come use my toilet. The only downside is now I have to keep my bathroom pretty and clean with all the company stopping in to try it out!"
"Wish we'd done this years ago. I have no reference to compare to other units but this first time install is a pleasurable unit. Brondell has a good unit here.
Complaint (Not really)? Warm to cold too fast."
"I'm returning this unit as the warm water runs out after only 5 to 10 seconds of use. This would probably be fine most of the time, but having a jet of ice cold water come at your delicate parts when you need some extra cleaning time isn't fun. I went back and read more of the reviews and found several that complained about the warm water running out quickly. Not sure if it is a defect in manufacturing or just the way they all work. The Dryer on it is a waste, as the air is cold and not strong enough to do any drying. I do like the blue light and the unit is very comfortable, sturdy, and easy to install. (as are all the Swash units) I did watch the You Tube video before I installed it. I think it took me about 15 minutes to get it installed. The remote for this unit is just ok. There is no memory on it so you have to re-enter the settings that you want every time you use it.
I will be ordering the Swash 1400 to replace this unit as the warm water is ""endless"" (it has a tankless heating element). It also has a warm fan."
"In 2014, my son and I visited Japan. We had a bidet in each of the two hotels where we stayed. I fell in love with it! When I got back to the good ole US of A, I search for a bidet only to find that they started around $2,000. I like a clean butt, but $2,000. Sorry!

Recently I search Amazon for a bidet. I found the Brondell Swash SE600 with the remote control! I ordered it, got it, and easily installed it. The best thing is that it was only about 1/5 of the price I was quoted in 2014.

I get kidded because I’m a guy. Do I care? Hell no! I like that I’m just as happy and clean as I was in Japan in 2014.

Thank you Brondell."
"We love the bidet, although the price is a bit daunting. Gentle cleansing, heated seat, easily adjustable with the easy to clean remote. We save water and protect from dry skin in winter by reducing the need for showers. The downgrade of one star is for the non-removable operating guidelines and warnings on the inside surface of the seat cover and because the anchoring system does not keep the seat from wandering a little. Also, the fancy bowl light is too bright and the wrong color. The blue light reflects in the water of the bowl, which makes you squint down your eyes, so that when you return to bed in the dark, your vision is not as sharp."
"Want to feel like the freshest royalty? Look no further! Heated water? Check. Warm seat? Check. Fan?! Yes please!!! It’s even aesthetically pleasing. The blue night light makes it so you can wander to the throne in the dark. Simply follow the glow to sweet relief without waking your partner with the light. For someone crazy short like me, throw a squatty potty under there and you got a place to hang out all day. Now this is living."
"I initially bought a bio bidet 1700. I read many reviews saying the Brondell was better, so I bought it for comparison. I think the BB1700 is sleeker and better made. The only point that I like more is that the Brondell has a built in LED night light. I can now get rid of the hang on the rim battery light. The air drier on the BB1700 is much better, and the water temp is more consistent. I’d I had to purchase another one, I’d go for the Bio Bidet BB2000 with the remote control."
"This is my second purchase of a bidet toilet seat .My first was a Toto which was nicer but also twice as expensive. I don’t regret buying this bidet seat . My only wish was that both my toilet and seat were elongated.I believe the extra room an elongated provides is a much better experience. If like me , you have a round front toilet . I would still recommend this purchase."
Mine is not installed yet but my friends is just like it and that is why I ordered it.
"This seat is everything you want in a toilet seat. I can't even imagine why we never bought one before. it is a clean device and easy to use. we did have to get a plumber in, as the pipe to attach to the water line did not fit. Make sure you check the specs and that the pipe is the same size of the pipe of your existing toilet. otherwise, you will need a plumber. The seat beats spending 1000s on a new toilet and this model is perfect in price, style and functionality. Please note it's white and my toilet is off white so you can see the difference, but I'm ok with it."
"Bought this for my husband who has Parkinson's and some bowel disfunction and movement issues. He thinks it works well, but could have a little more power. He is a big man (250 lbs.), but the seat is still large enough and comfortable enough for him. We had to have an outlet installed in our toilet area to use it, so hired a professional to put in the outlet and install the seat. The cord is quite short, so we need to use an extension cord to reach the outlet. The 4 stars is because I would have like it to have a little more water force."
"My wife ordered this. I would never have bet that I would like it. However, it really is a life changer. It works great and really cuts down on the use of toilet paper. It takes a little getting used to, but I wouldn't trade it."
"This bidet was a gift to our daughter and her husband. We have 2 bidets and love them. My daughter mentioned she might get a bidet for her husband. I got on it and made it their Christmas gift. My son in law is a gifted handyman, so he installed it the day after Christmas. Each has called to let me know how much they like the bidet.
I would recommend this for anyone. It’s easy for a plumber to install. I will never live without this type of bidet.
Five stars"
"Amazon delivered my new bidet seat in two days. I chose the Brondell Swash SE600 (Round in white) after studying lots of reviews, both positive and negative reviews, and comparing features and prices. My bidet seat is brand new I just got it. For me, installation was very easy. All of the functions and features worked really well, I did a thorough test operation. I am impressed and pleased with this new product. If you have never experienced a bidet seat you and your family are missing out on something that can really improve your life style. Bidets aren't just for the elderly or medical applications, they are for cleaning, comfort and quality of life. Brondell figured that out with the Swash SE600."
I installed it in 10 minutes. The remote is easy to use. Nothing could describe what it feels like giving your bottom a warm shower.
"I love it !! The seat was delivered as promised, a breeze to set up, and the remote control makes the operations easy and convenient. Walking away from the seat; I finally feel clean and refreshed. My first experience with bidets was while visiting my nephew in Uruguay. His Bidet was an older model, stand alone fixture positioned next to or along side the regular commode. I just assumed that's how Bidets came. One week of finally feeling clean made me miss it that much more when I came back home. Finally, one night, I started doing a little research and found out how easy getting my own Bidet would be. Like I say, I love it. I never want to go back to the old way of taking care of business."
Over all it is pretty good. There are a couple of things that could be changed to make it better. The length of time that the water stays warm isn't long enough. Within 5 seconds the temperature is rapidly cooling to cold. The sprayer also needsto extend a little further forward to reach all areas. Don't expect to have the dryer do a complete job because even after two cycles you won't be completely dry. All in all I like it and I'm glad that I bought it.
"I really like this product! I had always been a bit skeptical about using a bidet but since I started using this product I am sorry I waited so long to get one. It is simple to set up and use, the remote has different settings for water and seat temperature, settings of the wand and pressure of the water. The remote has a few other settings that can be used and just the regular setting has worked for us. The only thing I find out is that I have to use the ""drying"" cycle twice to feel completely dry.
I find this bidet very useful and I feel good about using it."
"This product had one of the better ratings on line for the value and price, i would concur, it was super easy to install, about 15 minutes, 20 tops. packed well and ready to install right out of the box. I am super impressed with this product and have told about 25 people i know how awesome it is. I will say it doesnt eliminate toilet paper entirely but where a roll used to be used in a day at our house in the bathroom between the family now it will last 4-5 days, A little pat down when finished and off you go. Best and most fun investment i have made lately"
"We bought this about 2 weeks ago & love it 😍 I have irritable bowel syndrome with constipation it is a God send it will actually stimulate a bowel movement unbelievable! It is easy to use & adjust the temp of water, move the nozzle where it is needed & the dryer is awesome no more toilet paper to chafe your bottom. The night light helps at night to see the remote buttons. Massage & move are awesome too! Incredible to have this after all these years they are standard in Europe & should be here too. Best purchase & not overly pricey for what you get. Thank you Brondell for this quality product."
"I replaced a 3 year old Kohler Novita bedit that the shut off valve would not stop the water flow from nozzle.
The Novita was the 1st bedit I had ever used and I had nothing to compare to.
I would recommend this one over the Novita everytime. It has more adjustment and hits the right spot where needed much better. You do have to be careful though, the water can get very hot on high setting, but that is my only negative."
"I can't imagine my life without it as toilet paper is a waste in many ways. The pandemic has shown us how crazy people are. The ease of installation and setup took only 10minutes and my kids love using it as well. I highly recommend this toilet to anyone as I have used these in Japan and always wished for one. If you want a comfortable and clean experience, look no further."
A plumber installed it. I'm no good at these things. It works great and makes me feel clean!
"I purchased the model S1000 about 4 years ago and we just loved it. The seat switch broke and I decided to replace the entire unit.
So, we purchased the newer and greatest model SE600. Well, newer is not better.
Here are the issues we have, that we did not have with the older seat.
1.Warm water reserve is too low and the water turns cold before finishing
2. Seat warmer is set on low and still too hot. Makes your butt cheeks sweat
3. Water pressure is set on low but still has a tendency to exit the bowl
4. Remote is not as good as the old one
I repaired the old seat. (only took a new seat replacement, 65.00) and will be swapping them out. I will be putting the new seat in a spare water closet."
"I’ve owned two Brondell washlets since 2005, and my house hasn’t been without. The older model, in the front bathroom, malfunctioned and instead of bringing it in for Brondell to fix (in San Francisco), I just decided to purchase a new one. The installation was easy because I am familiar with what is needed. My favorite thing about this model is that the water is identified by a blue light, for those of us who need to use the bathroom without turning on lights to disturb anyone. My favorite thing about all these washlets is the warmth of the seat and the cleanliness factor."
"We’ve had three Brondell seats now, and they all work great. They do the job…love the night light and spray levels."
"Better than toto. I just returned the Toto 2034, I had problems with it leaking as I had read about in reviews, but bought anyways. I went to hardware store to try to find better washers but because it’s a Japanese product they don’t have the correct washers at Home Depot or local Ace Hardware. Also the instructions are very difficult and I’m very good at putting things together. The other negatives on the Toto or the seat was hard and small. So now to this brondell product....super easy installation in 10 minutes. Instructions are very clear. Seat comfortable also. Very very happy I returned the other and bought brondell!"
 Frankly Im kicking myself for not buying one of these sooner. Just a life changing Item. Only gave 4 stars cause the warm water runs out a little quick. I should have gotten the 1400 model I guess for unlimited warm water. But still a great seat at a good price with tons of features.
I had the chance to actually try one of these out before I bought. Totally convinced it was worth the price and happy as can be I bought it! Loads of options to adjust to your own comfort level. My only complaint is the writing on the remote. (I have to keep readers in the restroom now!) 🤣
"This was my first experience with a bidet. It was so easy to install. However the pressure was so intense it was painful for me. I asked the company if there was a setting to make it less forceful. They recommended the 1000, it has more settings for spray width. And osculation function, therefore making it less of an intense stream. Also, the heating element doesn't heat the water for as long as on the 1000 series.
Besides the forceful spray, it was wonderful. It was just preference for me. The 1000 series is quite a bit more money. And for me it was worth it. But this is a great product. And the company was great with me with all my questions, wonderful service. Amazon was great in dealing with my return. All in all, I would recommend it."
I've used many bidets over the years and Brondell seem to be a solid product. Easy to self install and easy to keep clean. I do like the stainless steel nozzle to keep it clean. I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5.. the reason is the seat gets too hot even at the lowest settings. It gets too hot to where it gets uncomfortable.. so I don't use this feature because of that.. I wish heated seats were a little less hotter..
Ghost wipes used to be a once in a while phenomenon. They are now a daily occurrence. This brings me great joy. My only complaint is that there was a leak with installation that required plumbers tape. Despite this seeming to be a common occurrence there is nothing in the installation manual about it. Given that plumber tape costs 97 cents they should include a roll with every bidet sent out. Just my two cents. Otherwise after having done a lot of research this is your best bang for your buck product out there when It comes to mid range bidets.
Love everything about it except the range of the remote. Remote works fine but needs to be close to seat. I'm tall and if I don't point the remote behind me nothing happens.
"My husband and I bought this product because of the whole COVID-19 TP shortage. We were hoping it could help us decrease our usage so we didn't wind up in a pinch. And, it definitely did that, but it's also just... utterly fabulous. Never in a million years would I have thought I'd want or need such an item, but I will never go back to the bidet-free days. A thousand percent recommend. And this product is sturdy, effective, and easy to install. <3"
"Great product! Very pleased with the quality and features.
Pros: The remote has great signal reach and included all the basic functions in a easy to read and operate.
Nice slim design in which does not look bulky or non-esthetic.
Decent water power range and reach settings.
Good water and air temperature setting options.
Cons: Only one I found is that when the wand retracts it splashes some water onto the seat edge, but not too excessive.
Overall the family is very pleased with the Bidet. Excellent for the price."
"Have been thinking about getting a bidet toilet for some time. I researched the brands available and decided on the Brondell SE600. I purchased this and can't be happier with it's quality and ease of installation. Having a remote control is amazing. I really love the night light, warm water, heated seat and the fan dry features. This is like a luxury car! I just had hand surgery and this has been wonderful-clean with ease. Would recommend to family and friends."
I’ve had the bidet 2 months. Never had one before. Easy to install. Seat warmer adjustment. Seat closes slowly on its own. The remote is great. Cleans well. The dryer works ok. Still need a little paper to dab off any remaining water. The spray is sufficient and can be adjusted for both temp and direction. All in all a good product so far.
"I tested all the features before use and they worked as they should. However, once you sit down, everything stops working. In order to use it, you have to press whichever setting and THEN sit down, but you cannot stop or change settings while in use. Support is also nonexistent at this point. I'm going on two weeks since I've reached out, both via email and phone, and have heard nothing back. I'd steer clear."
"This is our second purchase of the Brondell 600. We loved the first one so much had to have another for the other bathroom.

The heated seat in the winter is a necessity & much appreciated. I had to convince my husband to try the bidet features but once he did he had to have one for his bathroom too.

I did a lot of research before making my first purchase and feel this one ticked all the boxes for the best price."
"It cleans very well. I like the ease of use and I like the auto feature. What I don’t like is that even after adjusting the nozzle to its most forward position with the remote, the sprayer doesn’t quite reach the female parts without having to adjust position, which causes spray to escape and wet the seat.

The dryer is a bit superfluous. I don’t especially want to sit there for several minutes waiting to dry. Also, the seat gets pretty hot the longer you sit, which makes you want to get off ASAP.

Bottom line: I like the Brondell Swash but I don’t love it - it’s not the best design for women."
"Great for shoulder surgery. Would prefer the Elongated version, but had to use what my toilet was. I'm 6'2"", 246lbs. So the round version is a tight fit. We've had it for almost two years now, still working great. The warm water only lasts about 20 seconds, but reheats fairly quickly. Steam is fairly strong, I would prefer it even stronger but it does the job. I would like a weirder dispersion vs the single stream but the ones I've tried were much weaker than this...at least the ones in my price range (<$300)"
"Broke after 5 weeks....shuts down, pops breaker. Changed receptacle and breaker....same issue. It was 1 week past return period. Contacted Brondell. It took a long time to get a replacement due to Corona virus, however, new unit arrived fine and works great."
"All Bidets seats take about 4 inches from the back of the seat. And, they all lift the seat off the bowel considerably, often causing urine to run out under the seat. Another brand I have has a lip extending from the bottom of the seat to the bowel preventing these mishaps. Mostly, the plunger that comes out to spray is running all the time after only 4 months of very limited use. Who know how long before it has to be taken out of service all together. For 350 bucks I expect Much, Much higher quality."
"Overall I think this is a great product. We have only had it installed just a day shy of a week. I am a little disappointed that I’m still having to use toilet paper to finish it off, but I do really feel cleaner. For the money I would have liked a stronger fit to the toilet it self. One last little gripe is that the dryer just seems to only dry the one cheek & even if you move it doesn’t really dry. Maybe I just need to work with it more than a week. Like I said though I do like it I just was expecting a little better."
"I had a Brondell bidet way less expensive for 6 years and the hot water tank was very good.
This new bidet has a very limited supply in warm water : from nice and warm to cold in less than 20 seconds, which is not the best way to end your experience!
The warm air dryer is not really efficient.
Overall it’s a good product but too pricy for the services rendered."
"I had read all about these seat bidets, and took a chance on this one (SE600) for price, ratings and history. I was warned about the blower needing to dry better, and the reviewers were correct. But overall, this is a quality product with many features and very easy to install."
"We are extremely happy/ pleased with our bidet. Purchased prior to having back surgery, it has greatly facilitated my recovery, and added to my comfort. I am very glad we have it, we researched and compared before buying. It has been an excellent purchase. Thank you!"
"Very pleased with all the functions offered by this bidet seat. I installed it myself after having an electrician install a GFS plug nearby. My only real issue is the dryer, which doesn’t do much at all. The remote is great and all other functions work well. Very pleased."
"I had the Brondell S1000 and loved it but wanted a elongated toilet, this seat is made well, but for some reason I seem to get some ""over spray' and get a little more wet. But it works great and install is a breeze."
Just installed without problems. Operation instructions easy to understand and apply. Nice options to adjust for personal preferences. One problem; the night light turns on when we flip the light on in the room and turns off when we turn the room light off. Seems something is not right with the night light. I will review with the company. Hope it works well for long time!
"As a chronic sufferer of diarrhea, this product is a God-send. So much more sanitary, convenient, cost effective, and comfortable compared to toilet paper and wet wipes."
"Our Brondell Swash 1400 has been absolutely awesome!
Installation:
The installation was straight forward and only consisted of removing our old seat, attaching the Brondell unit base (less than 5 minutes), then installing a t valve on the existing toilet water line (10 minutes). No special tools were required except a crescent wrench to lightly tighten the water line connections.

What we like (Pros):
-We love the heated seat, which we keep on low because it is warm enough.
-The spray performs well and has three different temperature, water pressure, sprayer distance and width settings.
-My wife has indicated that the front sprayer works well, but notes that she keeps it on the lowest pressure setting, which gets the job done.
-The night light is great and allows us to use the toilet in the middle of the night without having to turn on any lights.
-The seat opening is smaller than our original seat due to the components in the back; however, it is very comfortable and has not lead to any negative results.
-We tend to use the wall mounted remote versus the buttons on the side of the unit. The remote performs well and we like the two programmable user options.
-The deodorize function is neat, which basically removes the air from inside the toilet while you do your business and routes it through a replaceable charcoal filter, removing bad smells.

Maintenance:
The unit cleans itself before and after use automatically. It is also recommended that you lightly scrub it with a cloth or toothbrush occasionally. We have not noticed a build up of anything or had any problems with mold.

The charcoal filtered can be replaced, which is an easy process.

There is a filter on the water line that they suggest you clean at least once a year. We have whole house filtration and soft water and have not noticed any build up on the filter.

They do sell a water filter attachment than can be used if there are any filtration issues with your standard water lines.

Cons:
We don’t have any cons for this unit."
"I'm pretty passionate about this product so be ready for a rather long review. First off, I bought my first Brondell bidet about a year ago. I had been interested in getting a bidet for quite a while and, despite some skepticism from my family ( eww, water squirting on your butt! ), pulled the trigger and bought the Brondell Swash 1400 with the round bowl in December of 2018. Bottom line, we loved it, and I mean we ALL loved it. My families skepticism soon turned to praise as the discovered the wonders of having a bidet and a truly clean bottom.

Installation was a breeze. The only difficult part was installing an outlet next to the toilet installing the actual bidet only took minutes. The included instructions did an excellent job walking you through the process. The only hitch, and I can't pin this on Brondell, was that the bidet did not fit quite right on the toilet. The front of the seat hung over the edge of the toilet about an inch. If you look at the pictures I uploaded you can see what I am talking about. It wasn't a problem for my wife but for me things could get a little crowded up front. It was tolerable so we just left things as they were. I was impressed with the durability of the Brondell bidet. This is a device that gets used multiple times a day every day of the week. We have had zero problems for over a year. The only problem that did arise was my wife getting ticked off that the kids kept using the toilet in our master bath so they could use the bidet! Well, we solved the problem by purchasing a second Brondell Swash 1400. This time with the extended seat. We took our time measuring dimensions on the toilet we were going to be replacing our old toilet with to make sure the Brondell bidet would fit properly. It was a success. The seat fits great on the new toilet, looks great, and I really appreciate the extra room up front. We replaced our downstairs toilet at the same time and did the same job of making sure we would have sufficient room between the seat attachment points and the tank so the bidet could sit back far enough to maximize the room up front. I have attached pictures of the toilets we ended up buying. You can see in the pictures with the wood grain flooring the difference the new toilet made with how the seat fits.

Part of what makes the Brondell such a great bidet are the variety of controls that the remote gives you along with the two user customizable presets. It's great to be able to just push a couple of buttons and the seat temperature, spray pressure, spray width, and oscillation settings just the way I like them. My wife thought the night light was too bright and I didn't like chimes when you sat down which is why the ability to customize settings is so wonderful. We turned off the chimes and the night light and now both my wife and I are happy.

To sum things up, I don't think you can go wrong buying the Brondell Swash 1400. I did quite a bit of research before buying and the specs and features of this unit along with the many testimonials I read convinced me that this was the bidet for me. My parents were so impressed when they visited and used the Brondell bidet that they made the decision to buy on for their house as well. Do yourself a favor and pick one of these babies up today, trust me you will be glad that you did!"
"Brondell has installation videos that are great. Just watch them and pause as you get to each step. The bidet comes with all the hoses needed and the batteries for the remote. I’m very happy and excited to have this bidet. I purchased two. One for each of my bathrooms. I was able to setup eco mode by pressing the buttons on the side of the seat but it was difficult because the space on the right side of my toilet is very tight. Eco mode was the most difficult part of the setup due to the buttons being hard to access. The second hardest thing is setting up the user mode. I did the rear user 1 setup. I tried to setup the front for user 1 and it never took. Im going to try again. During the attachment of the hose and T valves, I did use plumber’s tape to ensure that I didn’t have any leaks. That proved to be helpful because I didn’t have any leaks. I love the heated seats and the heated water. I’ve been using a handheld sprayer bidet for the last two/three years and it only had cold water. I’ve done had it with the cold jetstream on my backside. I’m now a convert who can’t ever go backwards. This bidet is life altering for the better. I’m so happy to in such comfortable conditions when I go. We all deserve that."
"It worked great for 2 months. Spent a week jumping through trouble shooting procedures via email (customer service hours by phone end now at 2p Pacific). Figured out (without their help) that the reason the nozzles stopped coming forward was because the water heating element was not working. They didn’t work with Colorado winter cold water. When I purchased the bidet, I chose to pay for heated water for a reason.

Brondell said to send it in for repair. BUT they would not accept a box that exceeds 23x19x9. I squandered an afternoon checking UPS, U Haul, FedEx, USPS and Home Depot (where I went to purchase an interim toilet seat while the bidet was being sent back to Brondell) with no results for such odd size requirements.

I sent an email asking where I could get such a box, and said it would make it simpler if they would send me a replacement and I could send the defective one back in that box.

Their reply:

“ Regarding your request for a new unit, I'm afraid I must inform you that we are unable to ship a replacement box for your unit. It is the customer's responsibility to procure appropriate packaging for the repair.

In addition, I regret to inform you that Brondell's return policy does not permit the return or exchange of a bidet once it has been installed and/or used.
This policy is in place to ensure the quality and sanitation standards of our products.”

I suppose it is a very clever way for them not to honor their advertised year warranty by imposing ridiculous mailing requirements.

So, by all means, spend $500 on a Brondell bidet if you only need it to last for 2 months and don’t mind deceptive warranty promises.

I would, however, like to say THANK YOU TO AMAZON, who made an exception to their return policy on hearing that Brondell wouldn’t even send me a box or accept a box in a more standard size. I will have to pay a $100 restocking fee, but Amazon is basically absorbing the remaining $400. This 1 star review is strictly about Brondell and not Amazon."
"If you're shopping for a bidet toilet seat, then you probably already know how amazing they are. Almost incomparably more hygienic, time saving, toilet paper reducing, saves you from ever wiping yourself raw after a spicy meal, the list goes on. After using one for a while, you'll wonder how you ever lived without it.

I went with Brondell because my parents have the Brondel Swash 1000 and it had everything I'd want. I was tempted to buy a Toto, since it seems to be the brand all across Japan, however the Brondel has all of the same important features plus a lid you can sit on without breaking and a controlled, smooth close (i.e. no toilet lid slamming), plus is about half the cost. Just Google search ""Bidet Toilet Seat Comparisons"" and you can see the features side by side.

Basic features include: Front and back wash, 3 seat temps, 3 water temps, 3 water spray widths, I think 7 pressure levels (narrow on highest pressure will get you clean every time, I guarantee). deodorizer, sterilizer, bowl pre-spray to keep it cleaner as you go, movement function, dryer with different temps, and I think 7 position settings enough physical range to clean wherever you need it to go. The blue nightlight also looks kinda cool in the dark. It also has an eco mode and some memory setting which I never use.

Super easy to install, took nothing more than a flathead screw driver, my hands, and about 20 minutes, all necessary connectors/hardware included. I was fortunate to already have a GFI in my bathroom, however I do run the toilet on a short extension cord since the GFI is by the bathroom lights and not within reach of the toilet.

I have only 2 problems with the seat. First and foremost, the seat sits about a half inch to an inch too far forward on the toilet rim (I have a standard sized round toilet, and bought the round seat). I think this is an inevitability with the length required to store the nozzles plus all of the hardware inside to be seated on an American toilet with the tank so close (if your toilet tank is elevated separately from your toilet however, you could adjust the toilet seat position as far back as you'd need). It probably doesn't matter for women, but for men, things need to be moved around. See the pictures attached.
My second issue is that occasionally the rear washing nozzle sometimes doesn't fully retract, and will spray me a little bit as it cleans itself. This is easily overcome by pressing the ""Nozzle"" button to extend then retract the nozzles for cleaning, but is a bit annoying. It is probably just a small defect in my specific seat though.

I would take away a star for the 2 problems above, but the truth is I love having this seat so much that I still would give it a 98% satisfaction rate."
"I bought this bidet after having a miserable experience with 2 BioBidet failures. One that I've had for 9 months and another that I had just bought. So part of this review will be the misery I have had with BioBidet and the utter lack of customer support and part of this review will be about my new purchase of the Brondell Swash 1400-EW. I will start with the Brondell Swash. Let's start with the installation. Due to my recent problems with other bidets I wanted to follow the instructions to the letter. The instructions that come with the bidet say review the installation video on Brondell.com. Search as I may (maybe I'm blind) I could not find an installation video on that website. so, I went to YouTube and found a perfect video made by the owner of Many Bidets. Installation is a snap. Very straightforward. My 9 yo grandson could have done this with no problem. Things I like about the Brondell Swash 1400: ease of installation, the bum spray can be adjusted to hit the target with an adjustable force. The lady parts sprayer works well too! Things I wish were little better about the Brondell: Compared to the BioBidets the Brondell is not as sturdy feeling. Also, the opening is pretty small. I think it would not be a good fit for a man as they have a frontend package that might have trouble fitting in the opening.

Now for the BioBidet bashing. The BioBidet Discovery DLS is a very expensive bidet.($899) It is also a very nice bidet. The problem is that there is next to no help if something goes wrong. The first one I had came from a family member that could not transfer this bidet to a boat when they sold their house, so I got it. I don't know how old it was when it suddenly started gushing water from the housing, fortunately I was home when it happened. I called the company but there is not even a way to leave a message. The recording says the fastest way to get help is to send an email to customer service and expect help within 4-5 days. WHAT! 4-5 days to get support for a $900 bidet? I decided to buy a new one as I knew the warranty was not going to help me with this bidet. I bought the new one on Amazon. Hooked it up but it would not respond to the remote commands. Again I emailed the company. After only a few days they sent me a diagram on how to pair the remote to the bidet. Why didn't they send this diagram along with the installation instructions??? Anyway after pairing the bidet with the remote, it would only respond to a few of the commands such as ""close the lid"" ""open the lid"" ""run the fan"" but no actual bum cleaning was forthcoming. Emailed again. A week later I still have not heard back so to hell with BioBidet. I went with the Brondell.

In closing let me give anyone looking to buy a bidet some advice. Go take a look at an installation video from Many Bidets and read the comments. The maker of the video gives great advise to anyone who asks for help even though he has not sold them the bidet. I have found after reading several reviews on a variety of companies that customer service is poor wherever you go. You are going to get great customer service with Manybidets.com"
"I bought one previously when I was in a relationship, did not take it when I moved out. Regret! 6 months later I just had to buy it. You don't realize how great and hygienic these things really are. Forget those stupid wipes, this is superior on all levels. You'd think living in FL the heated toilet seat is unnecessary but when u keep the AC so low this is heaven at 3am. So happy I repurchased this."
"...You’ve just returned from doing Your Business and you feel fresh and clean and somehow lighter. Not too far away is a beautiful golden wind-swept wheat field that is dancing in the warmth of a glorious scarlet sunset. It could be your imagination, but it seems to call to you – to welcome you. You willingly oblige.

With very little effort, you seem to float off your porch and before too long, you find yourself in the middle of this beautiful field - instantly feeling surrounded by love. Butterflies are frolicking, and a lazy bird circles overhead looking for a place to settle in for the evening. The setting sun feels so nice on your face and you take a moment to take it all in.

Just then, you feel the urge to run through the field – to feel the wheat brush up against your body. As your body gains momentum, the wheat seemingly and instinctively parts way for you as if guiding you somewhere wonderful and magical. Your effortless slow-motion stride continues until an intrusive thought pops into your otherwise calm mind: “Did I take my allergy medicine?” Yes, you realize, and just then you come to a comfortable floating stop. You find yourself high atop a bluff overlooking a majestic ocean.

Looking to your left and see a lazy staircase that leads you to the beach below and before you know it, you find your feet sinking into the warm sand of the beach. You take all this in – the warmth of the sun, the sound of the ocean, the smell of the mist and with a barely audible song, you notice that same bird in the sky – flying on a pillow of air. Your eyes follow this bird for a while, but eventually give way to scanning the horizon over the ocean. You spot a playful pod of dolphins in the distance and look down to notice that your feet are being softly kissed by the warm ocean water.

A light scent of burning wood draws your attention over your left shoulder as your eyes fall on to what seems to be a small bonfire up on a dune. You turn and face this inviting spectacle and decide to draw closer and explore the amber glow. As you approach, your senses turn to the soft crackling of the growing fire – the scent instantly brings you back to your childhood. Closing your eyes, you pause to feel the heat of the fire on your face while simultaneously feeling the warmth of the sunset on the back of your neck. You could stay here forever.

You slowly open your eyes only to spot a figure on the other side of the flames. You try to squint to see who it is but can’t seem to get a clear image. As you round the fire and you draw closer to the figure, your body is drenched with a wave of emotion as you realize that somehow – some way – the figure you spot is your long-lost lover.

This tsunami of emotion propels you closer to your lover – the lost days, nights, years all seem to melt away as you fall into each other’s arms – becoming one again. The instantaneous passion, comfort, and feeling of joy and security overwhelms all of your senses and you feel more alive than you ever have. Somehow, unconsciously and with extraordinary speed, you find yourselves collapsed and naked on an oversized blanket that is impossibly soft and inviting.

Without words, your lovemaking begins. Your senses explode with almost as much passion and force as a thousand nuclear explosions. The smell of the fire, the light mist in the air. The glow of the fire and the remains of a beautiful scarlet sunset. The sand beneath the blanket makes way and forms into a comfortable cradle under the weight of two long lost lovers. As if impossible, your euphoric ecstasy is multiplied even more when your lover descends into your nether regions, hands firmly placed on your hips. Your breath quickens. Your heart races. Your head is thrown back by some primal and instinctual force and nothing else matters in this moment. It feels so…

“Um, you missed a spot.”, your lover says as they surface.

“What? What do you mean?”

“Well, uh, you know. You sorta MISSED a spot.”, the look is clear across their face. The expression is unmistakable.

Just then, you realize what that means. Suddenly, your heart feels like it has fallen from your chest, through your back and into the sand beneath you. “How?” you ask yourself over and over and over in your head. The quilting, the ridges, the aloe vera lotion… How could my ultra-plush multi-ply toilet paper have missed a spot? All the wiping. All the wiping!!! For the love of God, all the wiping!!!!!!

The world comes crashing down around you. Your lover has retreated in disgust, the bonfire has sent a spark to the wheat field igniting a blaze that burns down hundreds of thousands of acres of wheat crop nearly instantaneously. The pod of dolphin drowns and that annoying bird falls out of the sky only to be eaten by a shark so large it defies reality. Somehow, in your nakedness, you make it up to your knees with your arms stretched up to the sky. “Why? Whyyyyy?”, you scream. But instead of an explication by some omnipotent God, the sky opens up to reveal a torrential downpour, lightning strikes your retreating lover, the bonfire extinguishes (It’s too late for the wheat field…), and you find yourself cold, and in the dark, with an army of giant hungry mutant crabs closing in on you. Your screaming could be heard from miles away – if there were anyone there to hear it.

Two points: First of all, the only good that came out of this story is that thanks to the fire, the world was rid of a bunch of horrible gluten. Secondly, there would have been an entirely different ending if you had just used the Brondell Swash 1400 Luxury Bidet Toilet Seat!

Seriously, folks, using toilet paper after doing Your Business is like trying to get chunky peanut butter out of shag carpet with ripped sandpaper. You just aren’t going to get it all. There is bound to be leftovers that go unnoticed and this is just not a Good Thing.

Buying this seat has changed my life. As a parent of two young children, I have spent the better part of 6 years wiping someone else’s butt. Now I’m happy to have this amazing invention take care of mine for me! The heated seat, the gentle warm mist, the finishing warm air-dry – it takes you away to a world that is reminiscent of the story above. Minus, of course, the carnage at the end!

Installation took less time than it took me to write this review, and while the Swash 1400 won’t help you find your long-lost lover, it may just help you to keep them around a little longer once you do!

"My husband has wanted a bidet for several years, and I've always pushed back on the idea. When it recently became apparent that I was going to have surgery, he refused to take ""no"" and bought this to help me maintain my dignity and some bodily autonomy during recovery. I admit that I thought he was going a bit overboard with this purchase...

Since I've now had my surgery and am recovering from it, my perspective has completely changed. I missed having a bidet while I was in the hospital after surgery, and I'm very grateful to have one at home. He also bought washcloths to use for patting dry after using the front/feminine wash, along with two little baskets for the bathroom (one for clean, one for soiled). This has made a huge difference in my comfort and minimizing pain, and having a bidet has made it incredibly easy to get clean after using the toilet.

I am happy to have warm water to wash with because I find the water temperature straight out of the pipe to be quite cold on those parts of the body. Having the blow dryer for drying off our rears is great, especially for me since I would have to rely on my husband to dry me off otherwise. The dryer doesn't do much to dry lady parts, but that's what the washcloth system is for. Our toilet paper use is basically nil at this point, and we're only going to keep some in the house for when guests visit who aren't accustomed to using a bidet."
"I have been thinking about a bidet ever since the great pandemic toilet paper shortage.After talking to a few friends who went the bidet route and looking at various brands and models, thinking about if I really needed a bidet I decided on this one. To note…I had used a bidet before even though I had friends with various models I just didn’t feel right about asking to use their bidet for a test drive.

When it first arrived, I just kind of looked at the box and wondered should I send it back, do I really need a bidet I questioned myself?

Installation: I had a little issue with installing but that was on me, the directions were average, but went to my best friend…YouTube.

Overall: Now that I have used the Brondell for a month it far exceeds my expectations. I will never go back to the standard toilet seat. Heated seat with three settings,, a soft blue light, various settings for water pressures. It truly is like going to a warm cozy spa. Oh and to address the question if I really needed the Brondell bidet. Why yes I do! Okay maybe not “need” but I will never go back to the standard toilet seat. Seriously you should treat yourself!"
I am so glad I finally broke down and bought one. I would never go back to using a regular toilet seat ever in my house and if we can get these in public bathrooms that would be so great. For those that don’t have one of these what are you waiting for? This is a must have. Even my own man made fun of me when I first talked about getting one and now he uses it all the time. Definitely worth the money.
This is a great bidet…you can have a warm seat and choose the strength of the spray. Only problem is that it doesn’t completely clean your butt unless you’re suppose to have it on spray for more than 3 minutes.
"I had to return it for 3 reasons that may not apply to you.

Con #1: water pressure not strong enough for ME, but probably good for most people. I loved the 3 spray options, but wanted “turbo” option as well. I tried everything and nothing could need my needs.
I wish I had a bidet 20 years ago after my colon surgery. Read into that what you will.

I also wish I hadn’t taken 20 years to find one. Complete life changer! Also wish I could have afforded one like this 3 years ago. Worth every penny!

Pro: Remote control user interface was super easy.

Con #2: Seat was too small. Even though it was the elongated seat, the back of the seat where the tank is, has a sharp curve up too close to your bum, pushing you forward. I’m 5’2” and weigh 165. I do have a booty but it’s not THAT big. I felt like I was sitting on a kiddie toilet and it was uncomfortable on the back of my thighs. I honestly don’t see how a round seat could be useable to average sized adult bums. My husband who’s a lot taller said it was worse for him. Which brings me to…

Con #3: He doesn’t use the “bidet” functions. But after I replaced it with a different bidet, he told me HIS main complaint. He says while sitting, the seat doesn’t allow room for his “junk” in the front. Things women never think about, but I mention this for the male “experience” and figure some men will find this helpful info and will interpret this info appropriately, in a way a woman cannot.

Pro: Top quality bidet. Easy to install and use. Water temp was perfect and water supply was ample. The self cleaning option is nice too. I also like that the lid was sturdy enough for at least a lighter person to carefully sit on, though I instructed all household members not to.
Kids are not trustworthy….It’s mine…don’t break it!
I also appreciate their climate friendly green business model.

In all, I was disappointed and sad that this didn’t work out for me. I’m a long time manual bidet user and this was a big splurge for me.
I replaced it with the
Smartbidet SB3000. It addresses all my above needs, though the remote is a bit more clunky and doesn’t have the optional spray types. All this said, I will never use a lesser bidet again, EVER!
I’m in love!

They lost 1 star for stream pressure and 1 star for seat size.

Wish I had taken pictures of what the “fit” was like for my bum, before we removed it.
Hopefully the BioBidet designers take note and adjust accordingly. It need a flatter overall seat and more room at the back.
All bums will thank you!
Michelle"
"I will start with I want a Bidet in every single bathroom in my house after using this. Bought it as a gift for my husband, however he does not use it all the time because the toilet seat opening is smaller than a standard elongated one. My only other gripe is that the light is always on. ALWAYS! It can really wake you up if like me you use the restroom in the dark at night. I love the seat warmer. I love that I can change the pressure and tempurature of the water. I don't think the two nozzles adjust any differently from each other but that doesn't bother me. I think as much as I love this all other bidets in my home will be full toilet bidet and not a bidet seat. This was a very wonderful intro to into the world of bidet toilets in the home."
Added to a Toto elongated toilet easily. Compares favorably to Toto bidet at half the price.
"I ordered this bidet seat a week before my shoulder surgery and it arrived and I installed it a couple days before the surgery. I never realized as a male how much I would need and enjoy the cleanliness that a toilet seat bidet would offer. Of course my wife loves it too. I would have never purchased such an item if I would not have had to have rotator cuff surgery. Not too hard to get the picture here as the surgery was on my dominant shoulder. The toilet seat bidet was my cleanliness lifesaver after the surgery and of course continues to be. You just feel squeaky clean after doing your business. I am a 6ft. Tall 235 pound muscular male and I found the opening of the seat very adequate. Some said it was too small of an opening. My thought was doesn’t the water spray only need to hit the target the size of a quarter……? ok let’s say at the max maybe a silver dollar….Well…..I will stop my imagination from running too wild here, but actually if you would need more surface area coverage the spraying nozzles do oscillate back and forth and spray a wider pattern with more pressure if you press those options. All of those are adjustable and can be programmed for two users.

Enjoying the cleanliness of this product there is no way I will any longer be without one. I Almost hate doing my business anywhere else now outside my home unless it’s an absolute necessity. I am a handy guy and installation for me of course wasn’t difficult. For now and couple month ago, and since time was of the essence to install this before my surgery, and since I have no GFCI outlet near the toilet, I ran an 8ft. Heavy duty 10 gauge Extension cord purchased at Big Orange, around the back side of the toilet and vanity and plugged the toilet seat into the bathroom GFCI outlet. The cord is really almost hidden but I will run a dedicated GFCI outlet close to the toilet when able. Of course power needs to be run to the seat for it to function, and also for the heated seat and water. I fastened the remote onto a wall close by and the buttons on the remote can be pressed while the remote stays fastened to the holder. Bottom line my wife and I absolutely love this bidet. We both have the same perspective. At home we will never again be without one."
"cHello! Look here, I'm about to review this thing. I decided one morning that I would be Mr. Frugal fancy pants guy and buy a refurbished unit to save a few bucks ($75 or so cheaper than new). I did bad. It worked great for two months but now when activating the rear wash it loads up (which takes forever for some reason) & fires like 300 psi of scalding (at least 600 F) hot water (even when set to lowest water temp setting) for about 1-½ seconds before it shuts down and emits two successive beeps two, maybe three times. It won't restart after that. Not good, man! I've got sheet to do! So far I've been able to restore function by power cycling the unit (unplugging it & plugging it back in) prior to use but I doubt its malfunction has magically disappeared. Also, I'm not thrilled to have to power cycle a $500+ terlit seat to get it to work pre blast off nor am I optimistic that power cycling will continue to ""fix"" the problem indefinitely. So there's that. I will also say, it'd be cool if the LED light turned off with the lid down or maybe if it was dimmable or changed color but that's a pretty small gripe overall. Unfortunately for me the return window closed two weeks ago so I guess its my loss. I saved up for like 6 months for this thing so I'm kind of butt hurt.
I'll continue for clarifications sake. I'm a Brondell fan boi for sure. I used and abused a lower end unit (Swash 400, now obsolete) for almost 10 years that never gave me any trouble until one day I got a little silly with the shower wand during a deep de-crusting and accidentally fried it. I figured the TOTL seat from a company I'd had great success with would blow my mind to oblivion. I will say that for the 2 months it worked the 1400 was an impressive ace washer. It made quick work of the typical Wednesday morning pounding after a wicked Taco Tuesday. The 1400 effortlessly erased any and all remnants left from the unbelievable heat fire eruptions the morning after an epic 12 hour IPA pounding, chili cheese fry slamming booze cruise on the lake. As you can probably imagine, It's got some power! You can literally give yourself a daily colon cleanse if thats your thing. It's serious business, guys/gals. I'll be sad when it finally quits on me for good...
Furthermore, the deodorizer function is a critical component for this setup and is an absolute gas blast killer. Definitely a game changer during uncontrollable diarrhea situations. Before the 1400, I would sometimes dry heave so hard during the morning poopies that I frequently had to lay out work just to recuperate. Now that all my hotness can be swiftly swallowed up by the rugged 1400, I can focus on tying my shoes and eating candy before my shift at the mill. Overall, my productivity was way up overall. I liked that for the 2 months it worked. It had absolutely no problem immediately gobbling up the otherworldly blasts from my fat can. It was really impressive, honestly. A total game changer as previously mentioned. I've never used the front blaster because I'm a dude but I'd be willing to bet its just glorious for the ladies. Actually, I had some pretty rowdy Indian food for din dins so for the sake of research, I might (need to) give it a try later. Just to see how it feels. Don't judge me. I'm not feeling well. For my parents sake, I hope the unit decides to work when it happens.
One more for posterity. I live in a 150 sq-ft basement loft at my folks house and they get super pissed when I blast the serious heat fire. It radiates straight through the floor and into there mouths. The 1400 has saved my butt (and my rep) countless times on all accounts. I always seem to suddenly and unexpectedly get the bubble guts while trying to get busy with Tinder hotties that just want to party at my place. I don't know what I'll do next time this happens and the ol refurb 1400 decides to let me down, again. I'll be crushed as a man for sure and might end up with no more ladies forever. I assume the rents would probably evict me as well. Again. It could be a totally ruinous situation.
I want to help you fine friends avoid the treachery & deceit I've experienced during my dealings with this refurbished Swash 1400 Luxury Bidet terlit seat. So, to sum this whole thing up, I'd recommend everybody steer clear of the refurbished units. Don't be like me! Avoid that Booty Burn! Unless of course you're in to poaching's of your private potty regions. If thats the case, get some! Good luck and Godspeed. Hope this helps.

Bye for now,
Soggy Ace"
I like the bidet because it greatly improves my personal hygiene and reduces the use of toilet paper.
"SAVE THE BOX AND PACKING MATERIAL!

First of all, I love the concept and most of the execution of this unit. Note, as with all similar items, you must have an electrical outlet nearby, preferably behind or beside the toilet.

I got my first one before having major wrist surgery. The Swash 1400 was a life-saver. Ditto a couple years later when back surgery made it hard for me to just hop into the shower whenever I wanted to clean up.

If you have to replace the seat itself (not the lid), the process of disconnecting the seat and installing the new one is not easy. I'm pretty good with technology, but had to watch a few youtube videos to get advice that was easy to comprehend and execute. And I was terrified of breaking any of the plastic pieces.

After only a few months, one of the two units failed. The water didn't heat up. Per the manual, it seemed to be overheating and tripping the internal fuse/breaker. Brondell requires you to ship the entire unit back for repair. Even though it was quite new, they didn't replace the entire unit, just the electrical ""brain"". Removing it, draining it and cleaning to their specifications was not fun. And they threaten that if you don't clean it to *their* satisfaction, they'll tack on an additional cleaning fee.

The other unit, which was used by just one person, failed after 5 years. In the meantime, there are other bidet toilet seats that get great reviews and which are less expensive, with new additional features. So I won't repair the old seat. I'll just get a new one.

I'm not sure how long one of these things should last. I suppose 5 years isn't bad if there are multiple users.

The plastic lid is easily scratched. It isn't flat, so if, for instance, a cat jumps on it and starts to slide off, you'll see a lot of scratch marks. Don't clean with harsh products or scrubbers; you'll ruin the finish.

If you want a wider range of reviews, look at Amazon and also online for ""best bidet toilet seats"" to get comparisons and additional info."
"It really does the job. Warm seat all the time. Must buy!
Very impressed. Works great."
"After extensive research and perusing Amazon reviews, we settled on this bidet toilet seat. My husband installed it. He did have to buy a hose and T fitting to hook up the water, but it was very simple and fast otherwise, and we have been enjoying impeccably clean bottom bliss ever since. I did not realize how much I would appreciate a warm toilet seat until I had one. Water pressure, temperature, and nozzle position are adjustable and satisfactory. We’ve read about a high pressure (aka enema) setting on some bidet seats - this is not something we were looking for so I cannot attest to that functionality. The highest pressure setting is more than adequate for external cleaning. If you’re squeamish you should stop reading now and just buy the damn thing. You’ll be happy you did.

So you decided to keep reading, on to the detailed review..... Basically the value in these bidet seats is to squirt poo off your brown star, negating the need for toilet paper. I can attest that this bidet seat will wholly and satisfactorily meet that expectation. “Rear” wash setting gets 4 thumbs up. As a woman, I was very skeptical about the “front” wash settings. It has been alluded to that the wash experience could be very “enjoyable”. IMO that is a laughable stretch of the imagination. I was concerned about the spray being ”intrusive” - pleased to report this has not been a problem. I find the bidet generally unnecessary for clean-up after #1, although it does help keep your lady parts so fresh and so clean clean in the event you’ve been to the gym/hot yoga/had sex since your last shower. It also does a great job addressing the monthly menstrual massacre. I was initially concerned the outcome would be something akin to blood spatter all over the toilet, but thankfully that was not the case. I did not expect the bidet seat to become the choice tool for post-coitus clean up! Let me set the stage - you’ve waddled into the bathroom with the sex towel/t-shirt/boxer shorts pressed against your crotch like you’re holding pressure on an arterial wound, because no one wants to clean that off the carpet, and you settle onto the toilet. Chances are its going to take a fair bit of wiping or a shower to get your vag back to a state that will not produce the equivalent of a loogie in your panties. Enter the bidet seat! The front wash setting will wash his man gravy out of all your nooks and crannies, along with any water soluble lube. If you did feel the need for a little soap and water action, the bidet produces enough water/water pressure to adequately rinse you off. We bought this bidet seat basically for the back door applications, but its utility for maintaining fresh girly bits cannot be understated."
"First I'd like to say this is a very nice product. It's a bit pricey, but most of the design is well done. I bought two of these (elongated first, and later the round version). The round version is rather small, but it worked for a toilet in a small bathroom that is close to the tub. Elongated is better if you have the room. After five years the elongated version soft close lid broke at one of the hinges. This was from normal use with no abuse of the lid. If you close the lid when you flush, then you will probably have a broken seat after five years. I suppose that could be considered normal, but it seems it would have been easy to make the hinges out of metal or even a more robust type of plastic. Warranty is three years, so of course this broke in five. Also, it doesn't appear that there is a replacement lid for this model. Just wanted to give a heads up to anyone that might be sitting on the fence about what brand to buy...this may help your decision. Also, I should add that the toilet lid still works, it just snaps open or closed when it's moved. Other than that and the short burst of cold water before you get warm water as mentioned in some other reviews I like the bidet seat."
"We've had this for about 6 months now. There are definitely features we don't use (the blow drier, the ""deodorizer,"" the ""wide spray,"" etc.) so it's possible a cheaper one would have sufficed.

But we make daily use of a bunch of the features:
* Rear wash: works great for me.
* Front wash: Mrsmicah says the rear wash function doesn't hit her in the right spot, but she uses the front wash function as a rear wash so I'm glad this seat has that flexibility even if we don't use it as intended.
* Presets: Mrsmicah and I have quite different preferences for water temperature and strength, so it's great having the presets where you can hit just two buttons and after 3-4 seconds of warmup time it hits us in the right spot with the right strength and temperature.
* Remote: I definitely appreciate being able to place the remote somewhere convenient (we have a little ledge above our toilet paper dispenser) instead of twisting around.
* Toilet bowl LED: Having our toilet bowl lit up with a blue LED is a little cheesy (it can be disabled if you hate it--otherwise it's on all the time, even when the lid is closed), but it's actually quite nice if I wake up in the middle of the night and want to pee without turning on the lights.
* Sittable lid: Other brands (like Toto) say you shouldn't sit on the seat lid when it's closed as you might break it, but Brondell approves sitting on this one. I'd hate to give up the ability to sit on the toilet when getting ready in the morning.

Note that you do need a GFCI outlet to plug it in.

My only complaint is that because of all the electronics/mechanical parts in the back of the device, you end up sitting a little farther forward on this seat than you would on a standard toilet seat. We are using the elongated model on an elongated Toto Aquia wall-mounted bowl, and the outer edges line up perfectly, but because of that forward seating position I find some of the solid material we deposit into the bowl doesn't fall into the water but falls an inch or so in front of the water and tends to stick to the dry toilet bowl even after a flush. I suspect that a ""pre-misting"" feature like on some of the Toto brand bidets might alleviate this problem, and that's the one missing feature I wish this seat had.

But all in all we are quite happy.

Also be aware that this seat goes on sale a few times a year on Amazon, Amazon's Woot.com affiliate, and at places like Home Depot for under $400, so don't pay $500+ for it."
The Bidet is better than I expected. Works as advertised. I am very happy with this purchase
"Why four stars? The Remote feature is nice, but at this point with so many options I still end up touching the remote 3x+ to deodorize, clean and then dry. the User memory feature is just too basic to be worth the extra. I also dislike the space required for all those extra components on back of the bowl.

Why almost the Cadillac?: That other brand that also happens to be the name of a dog in a movie is just a bit more elegant. I've used a comparative unit elsewhere and I was surprised how well thought out the other brand was. Was it worth nearly 2x the price? no. Even now I'll be replacing the remainder of my home toilet seats with similar Brondell Models and not the overpriced competitor.

Installation: Wasn't all that bad. It took me all of 30 minutes to remove, clean the area and install the Brondell unit.

Remote : At this point in a tech world, it's almost crazy to think that I couldn't program and/or control this with an app. Sorry for the TMI, but like many people I bring my phone with me and may do my business while reading the news (go ahead, judge me, you're probably reading this on the toilet). I should be able to hit a previously programed physical button on user 1 and it does my preferred deodorize/cleaning/drying cycle OR open the app and it does the same. Am I the ideal user? maybe not. But it's a feature we should see in 2020.

The blah:
Overall, this unit has flaws that are annoying (ahem.. remote), but won't degrade the overall experience. But where it comes in short (pun intended) is that big box on the back of the seat. Elongated toilets should be a minimum for this seat if you're a male. But understand this:. for those of us with dangly bits hanging there, nothing bugs me more than moving around and hitting the front of the inside bowl and this is why I bought an elongated toilet. The Brondell unit occupies a large space on the back rim, about 1/3 back of the bowl making the toilet effectively a smaller round bowl. I understand I bought the top model, so it's hard to pack all that in, but I feel there's a better design with effort.

Brondell: always happy to be a tester :)"
"I have wanted a bidet for years but thought you had to have one that was like a toilet (as in Europe). Turns out these add-no’s work very well on a regular toilet! If you have any GI difficulties, I would say these are a must-have! They actually do clean well, much better than just toilet paper. I got the fancy one that has warm water and warm air, and I’d say it was well worth it. The remote control makes it very easy to adjust things. I put mine on the wall at hand level. I’m guessing it would be very hard to adjust if you had to try to bend down to see the non-remote controls. As for the installation, my son installed mine. He is very handy, and it took him at least an hour. If you think it’s beyond your talents, just face facts and get someone to do it for you. I’ve had no problems with leaks or instability at all. Rarely, the remote gets confused and doesn’t do what you asked, but so far it’s not much of a problem. These were reviewed in Consumer Reports, and they came out first (both brand and model), so that made the decision for me. The other ones tested came out well also, so maybe they’re good too. It does bother me a bit that they caution you not to use strong cleansers. After all, this item probably poses the biggest hygiene requirement in your home. Also, I find it hard to believe that their “sterilization” process does what it claims. The little and gentle streams of water come out the same nozzles that the body-use ones provide. They claim that silver does the disinfecting, but I doubt that it does much. ( Would like to see their data on this!) The seat is comfy, but if you put the lid down and try to sit on it like a regular toilet, it feels unstable and is slightly slanted forward so that you slide forward. Just don’t try to use it as a chair! The air drying, even with heated air, does not dry you completely so you need to complete that process on your own. All in all, I would highly recommend this item and am delighted that I finally got it! Highly recommended!"
"While Toto (made in Japan) and BioBidet (designed by Korean manufacture) are the two market leaders, Brodell definitely gives a run for their money with its the latest model Swash 1400, after 1000 and 1200.

It carries almost all the necessary features in the premier class, with two outstanding features inline with leading models from Toto, the nozzle sterilization and spray width adjustment (wider front spray width) which are often not found in other brand in the same price range, for example BioBidet.

I have a BioBidet 6800U and BB-2000, the sprays are ranged from mild to strong but all are narrow. While BioBidet is proud of its water pressure and vortex features, a wider spray actually brings much comfort than water pressure, especially to female front clean. So far, only Toto and Brodell have paid attention to this.

However, Brodell 1400 has a lower than average water pressure, although largely compensated by the wider spray, some may feel stronger spray is favorable. Also due to the pure tankless design, it takes 15 seconds from pressed button to the nozzle to spray warm water. This delay is consistent with all other tankless bidet which doesn't have a hybrid design including a small tank avoid the delay in the initial water heating.

The reason I gave a 3 stars is because Brodell 1400 is still far from perfect. There are two design problem/decision that makes less ""premier"" than other high end bidets. One is the deodorizer, it's almost useless comparing to BioBidet or Toto's, but mostly attributed to it doesn't turn on automatically when you sit on seat. Even your turn it on it only runs for like 2 minutes, so you'd have to repeatedly turn it on. Comparing others turn it on as soon as you sit down and automatically turn off when you leave the seat which is a much better design.

The other problem may be subjective. The nozzle position seems shoot water either at a strange angle or simple not far enough, result in spray doesn't reach far enough, for both front and back wash. Several of us tried and all must lean forward to allow the spray aim better but causing splash to the back of seat. I've looked all over on web for reviews of this issue and only a couple complained the same. So I can't claim this is an overwhelming problem but beware of this and try for yourself.

Other than these few drawbacks, I'd mostly value the features that are more important to me, such as the wider spray and nozzle sterilization, which are incidentally the only two features Toto does better than all the others (if not count the premist). For half of Tot's price, you get what you paid for."
"They say to not cheap out on anything that connects you to the ground. E.G. Shoes / Tires / Bed, and in my opinion, bidet. I would consider myself something of a bidet enthusiast since making the switch about 7 years ago. It's one of the few quality of life changes I've made that I feel like has had the largest impact for the lowest cost of entry.

As for the S1400-EW I can attest that it is quite the upgrade from my first model, being a $20 Amazon special (Luxe Neo 120) that was basically a rectal sandblaster, to the first electric seat (my directly previous bidet) that cost around $200 (S300-EW).

Feature wise I will advise that if I read correctly the heating element in this model is based on ceramic heating which is much faster at heating the water, but also has a stronger energy pull than the S300-EW and if like me, you happen to have touchy GFCI breakers this can cause a little house on the prairie style BM in the dark.

That aside, the other functions work quite well and the nozzle adjustment, water pressure, and user settings are all very easy to navigate and work great. The night light works great for those half blind 2am calls of nature. The blow dryer is quite nice and gets VERY warm if you have it set to max heat. I will advise to FLUSH BEFORE YOU USE IT otherwise the smell you will generate by using it is not something you will want to talk about.

All in all very happy with the upgrade even if I have been just using it on cold while I get my breaker situation figured out. 10/10"
"We’ve owned 6 Brondell heated toilet seat/Bidets over the last 20 years and remain absolutely amazed with them. Their versatility for multiple users, the heating variations, the auto cleaners and the water sprays are FANTASTIC !! We live in northern Alaska & NOTHING is better than a heated seat year ‘round!"
Recently went to Europe and used a Bidet over there and loved it. I have been using wipes for years so this is much better. Set up was fairly easy and remote works well. Please not that the seat opening is kinda small. I am 6’4 about 260lbs so sitting on the small opening is not great but still happy with the purchase.
I used an older model which ran out of warm water half way though the cycle. This ones is much better. Thank you for the upgrade and here's to a clean booty. Perhaps an adjustable fan speed could help.
"The original review is below. This is my updated use on the Bidet as of 5/15/21.
So this does not get me clean enough in my opinion and all the extra bells and whistles are not appealing as I was expecting. This seat stinks!! It seems like public restroom and I believe it is just the seat and the deodorizer absorbing all the smells. Yuck. We are constantly cleaning the seat to remove the smell but once the family starts using it again it returns. Not only that it's also the smell of the plastic that makes it bad. So if this was 300 dollars cheaper and sold towards really small individuals it would be good. Because my children fit perfectly and can clean themselves in while on the bidet without having to spread their cheeks and shimmy your butt around. I really wish I could get the water pressure stronger. The spray that is coming out just doesnt cut it. The position should be able to be saved under users. It doesn't spray my fiancee or myself in the proper area dead on. This should be a design priority because different sized people exist. The temperature still works properly, it does have a off moment where the temp will get really hot or really cold for a split second in the middle of the spraying cycle. And the seat tempature has been consistent. I really don't use the deodorizer it should just be removed from the bidet all together. As I stated above, constantly cleaning the seat anyway. The dryer is still subpar, maybe with the deodorizer gone they can install a larger stronger blow dryer.

Original review
Installing is simple just use pliers. I find it strange that from the cheapest attachments to the most expensive seats, people often complain that the water can't hit them right. I'm 6'4, my fiancee is 5'7 and we both need the sprayer pushed all the way forward. We both adjust ourselves during the cleaning process. I don't like the posture the seat puts me in. I also think the water pressure could be stronger, I felt it with my fingers and it's a real lack luster spray. I'm used to showering after no 2s. When I went through one cycle and wiped after I still had doo doo flurries and juice. Because of that I have started to use the cleaning setting twice, once with soap and water. The dryer function is subpar as well. You might as well sit back and read until your butt is dry and that's IF it dries all the spots. All and all I'm on the toliet for about 15 minutes now. Just not worth the price tag.

Final verdict: if you dont see improvements in the newer models that point out the flaws of this model review dont buy it. Get a older model, don't waste your time or money. And there are similar complaints on other reviews for other models as well. All the companies need to take into consideration of a bigger sample of heightxweight individuals. Water pressure should be stronger so you can actually clean your butt. The deodorizer is pointless. The seat stinks after multiple uses making you constantly clean your bathroom. And nozzle position should be able to be saved under user settings. I originally had this at 3 stars but I'm dropping it to 1."
Very comfortable and easy to use.
"The water nozzle movement isn't that good, you have to scoot yourself to reach the cleansing stream. What's the point of buying this Luxury Bidet Toilet seat, if it doesn't clean as efficiently. I bought another Luxury Bidet Toilet seat for $150 less that works much better. Disappointed."
"Combining over-the-top technology with a clean, neat design, easy to install easy to use. I think it's the best bidet we can get right now. Love it!!!"
"This was my 3rd purchase of a Brondell unit over the years but first time purchase of a unit through Amazon.I received the 1400sw and it's awesome as expected.The only problem I encountered was the location of the power supply cord.My other units all had power on the right side of the unit and that's the side of the wall I had installed the electrical receptacle.This new one is on the left.By the time I had reworked/moved the electrical issue several days had passed.Beware if you try to purchase the extended 5 year warranty from Brondell and 14 days have passed since you ordered the unit from Amazon,your time is up and your out of luck with the extended 5 year warranty purchase.You are stuck with the 3 year warranty which has limitations in the 2nd and 3rd year.If I had known I probably would have called Brondell the day I ordered.Hopefully this one will be as dependable as the others were."
"I just installed and tried out the Brondell Swash 1400, so this is my initial review.

I followed the installation video on Brondell's website, pausing as I went. The visual instructions made it super easy to install. A surprise for my install was a hard supply line, as opposed to a flexible one -- so I removed the old one and took it with me to the hardware store to get a flexible one. I came back and finished the install in probably 20 minutes.

I must say I have greater respect for plumbers after working in the tight space between the toilet and vanity to switch out the supply line! :)

First test use went perfectly. The remote was super easy to use (referenced the User's Guide to understand aspects of operating the remote, and figured other aspects out myself -- it is intuitive enough to use).

I had been using a Toto Travel Washlet before this (we just had an outlet installed next to the toilet yesterday), and the Brondell does a more thorough job. I still had to follow up with a flushable wipe, though -- it didn't completely clean my bum. Next time around, I will let it go for two rounds instead of one! :)

The water temperature was initially cold (the default), and quickly became warm when I adjusted the temperature setting. It should remember my temperature preference the next time I use it.

One aspect that I am not crazy about is that the opening is smaller than with a standard elongated seat because of how the Brondell comes up at the back. The TOTO S350e and S300e Washlets differ in that aspect of their design, but they also cost a bit more. The reviews also seem to indicate a level of dissatisfaction with their reliability in comparison to the earlier S350 and S300 models.

I'll report more as I use the Brondell, but so far, I love it!"
"A life style changer! Happily use it every day.

We had many concerns, would the seat fit the toilet, would I and it fit, (I'm 200#), would it be too high for my wife (Petite), how ugly would it look, would we like it, would it work as described. It's a significant cost and our first bidet so we contacted Dexter at customer service (very helpful and patient) and were eventually and happily satisfied with his answers to the degree that we ordered the Luxury 1400 model.

It came quickly and was installed just a quickly with the parts provided. We read the instructions, watched some YouTubes and started experimenting with the settings...many settings, even more for my wife.

So here are answers to initial concerns: Seat fit perfectly and is more secure on our bowl than previous regular seat (W.C. is Glacier Bay French Curve from HD.); I and it fit very comfortably and all went fine in the stand up mode too; Just very slightly higher but fit wife fine (seat very comfortable for both and she loves the heated part, me not but we live in FL); It truly looks attractive and sleek no issues here; We love it and ""almost"" look forward to our daily visit; It works exactly as described, no disappointments; The investment in our comfort was worth the extra money to get the 1400 Luxury features, we use every one of them! Think of the memory button as in your car's memory seat and mirror adjustments....couldn't live without it.

The biggest life style change is the deodorizer. We no longer strike stick matches, spray stuff in the air and turn the exhaust fan on high. The deodorizer really works and it really pleases my wife. That alone is worth the price.

I'm and older dog and happy I learned this new trick. Brondell Luxury 1400 is the bomb, they got it right. (These comments are 100% voluntary besides, I couldn't make this stuff up:)"
"The price is great, it is fairly easy to install and has lots of features. However, the water, that was supposed to be heated (on the unit we received, anyway) first sprayed cold, before heating up, every time. The cold burst wasn't pleasant. The seat barely heated up - only a little in the back, but not on the sides or front. I believe the unit we received was defective. However, there are design issues as well. The back of the seat is very high (for the water heating tank presumably) but this is not comfortable for one's back. The front spray does not reach nearly far enough forward for the average female anatomy, a common issue with washlets. One has to lean forward and shift back for the spray to even come close to reaching the area it is intended for. I dislike that the night light is blue. It's a very nice blue, but blue lights are not recommended for night time, as they can disrupt sleep and sleepiness. The light can be turned off entirely, but then you've lost the night light feature. The Toto is much more expensive, but it is more streamlined and much more comfortable without that super high back edge of the seat that the Brondell has. The Toto has a much more sleek appearance, and has a seat that fully heats, and warm sprays that better reach the right places, and the lid opens/closes automatically which I wouldn't have expected to matter, but it turns out to be a really nice feature. For the money, and if one received a fully working unit, the Brondell seems to be a good value item. It does fit more securely than our Toto does, and it doesn't have the unpleasant off gassing odor the Toto had for a few weeks when the fan/dryer was used."
"We really like our new Swash bidet system. Installation was very, very simple and took less than 20 minutes. The Swash does a surprisingly good job cleaning. We hoped it would but just had some doubt that it would be as thorough and fresh feeling as it truly is. My wife uses both the rear and front cleaning modes and loves it. She was somewhat concerned about the two cleaning modes splashing dirty water into the opposite side while in use as she has susceptibility for urinary tract infections. After many uses she is satisfied that there is nothing to worry about there. I suffer from mild hemorrhoids and I really looked forward to keeping my rear end cleaner and less irritated than by using toilet paper. I'm happy to report that it passed my test as well. Quality wise, this bidet is just plain awesome.

The only reasons why the Swash 1400 did not get 5 stars are the following... Programming the User 1 and User 2 settings and using those settings with the remote has not been working like we expected. Maybe it is user error on our part with the instructions. But those particular instructions weren't as clear as they could be. I'll keep trying. The other issues are the odd steps it takes to turn on and off the night light. There should be a single button for that function. Sometimes we want it on; other times we don't. Otherwise, absolutely no complaints from us.

If you are considering this unit we definitely say... Do it. You won't regret it. It's worth the investment."
"This seat has many useful adjustments incl spray width, nozzle movement, temperature and pressure controls. All work well.
I bought this model because you can program settings for two people that start their respective settings with the touch of a button. Otherwise, you might set adjustments during each use.
There is also an ""auto"" button that runs a preset cycle.
The drying function is a very slow, marginally successful process that takes too long. A quick dab with a little tissue works fine.
Installation is very easy as long as you have a gfi socket nearby. Be really careful to not cross-thread your connections, something I did by mistake, causing me significant consternation.
Sometimes a little residue may remain that you can remove with a little tissue.
Some reviews mention the tight opening. I agree. Getting Big Jim and the twins in place comfortably is a little tight.
Overall, very happy with the 1400."
"This is an excellent product in my experience so far, after purchasing it about 2 months ago. It was fairly easy to install, although it was difficult to access the nozzle under the toilet tank as my room is very narrow - I had to use a mirror to see what I was doing - no leaks yet. Features I really like - the adjustable nozzle position and spray width, adjustable seat temp, water temp, and water pressure. I don’t so much use the deodorizer as it doesn’t seem to work too well, and the air dryer seems to blow odor out of the bowl into the air ( I suppose one could flush first, but my flush button is hard to reach while sitting.) The night light is great. It’s easy to keep clean. One negative is that after checking my toilets measurements, the seat still fits a little strangely- it sticks out in front of the bowl just slightly, and the front of the seat exposes a little of the rim (see photos). Overall, I found it to be a minor issue and decided to keep the bidet even though it is not a ‘perfect’ fit. If using with a foot rest/squaty potty, the seat may be slightly awkward as far as how much room there is in the front (I’m a man and have had issues with not enough room at the front of the bowl in the past, so this particularly bothers me when its an issue)."
"I first bought a swash over 12 years ago. I thought it was a fun novelty item for the bathroom and that my friends would get a kick out of it. I loved this bidet and my new one is AMAZING. I doubted that the deodorizer would really be effective...WRONG! It works great. There are many more features on this new one. I found the dryer to be stronger thus drying has been improved from my previous one. The blue light makes a great night light if you leave the lid up...don't leave the seat up cuz you know the little lady won't be amused (or anyone else thinking that they can sit). There are so many features that put you in control of every feature. (almost every feature has multiple settings. One of my absolute favorites is that you can move the water stream to reposition it to ""hit the mark"". It even has a button for a back and forth motion that it will move automatically. If you have a favorite setting you can use the ""User 1"" or User 2"" buttons that will remember your settings. The buttons are large and easy to use. Sometimes in the middle of the night, I don't feel like turning on the bathroom light because it's ""overstimulating"" and I may have a harder time getting back to sleep. I have a pretty good idea where the buttons are and because they are large the remote is easy to navigate. Maybe their next remote will light up...hint hint. The one thing you do need to consider is that you will need an outlet close to the toilet. I had one installed near the base of the toilet. Finally, I know...you thought this would never end...you will not need as much toilet paper...a little dab will do ya..."
"I was very sceptical buying this product. Just a thought of having something shooting up your rear end did not sound pleasant. But fighting off my fears and reading and watching some reviews I decided to buy the product. It was a well worth the buy and even more. I had my new construction specifically wired to have this AC product. The installation was very easy. The first use was pretty scary, but over time you get used to it. Some of the awesome features are: soft night light. You wont be blinded by bathroom lights if you have to use the toilet at night. The different levels of seat warmth. No longer you have to cringe when initially setting your bum on the cold toilet seat. The different levels of water temperatures and water pressures will make sure you are clean. The product even comes with a remote, so you feel like royalty and not a peasant. And once you are done cleaning your royal end, you will be dried, which you can set with different levels of warm air. There are 3 things that I did not like though. Due the sophistication of the product and all the components that had to be used, this will make your toilet opening smaller. So if your rear end is large you will have to reposition or find something else. Also the drying process probably need more though. You will not be able to dry everything in one go. Multiple passes are needed or a toilet paper. Lastly, because your hands never come in contact with your posterior you have to still remember to wash your hands. Otherwise you will get that disgusting look if you use the toilet and won't wash your hands."
"We were a little tentative about our 1st bidet purchase but after hearing positive feedback from friends & family we decided to take the splash. As with a lot of our purchases we research through reviews. In our searches we found many favorable reviews about Brondell products. Next we visited the Brondell website and viewed the videos about their products and also viewed installation videos on YouTube. Decision made! Let’s order the Brondell Swash 1400!

The Brondell was received from Amazon in only a few days. Installation could not have been easier. Let the Swashing begin. My wife and I were amazed how much we had been missing out on the bidet experience. Personally being greeted by a warmed seat 1st thing in the morning is most enjoyable. The deodorizing feature is especially appreciated. We honestly don’t have one negative take away from this purchase.

For those considering a bidet purchase, as with most other purchases, you get what you pay for. You can buy a bidet for under $50 but would prefer a cold or warm splash on your bottom? How about a bidet that has a sterilization feature or one without? Let’s not forget the money you can save on toilet paper with a drying feature. Needless to say we love our Brondell and would recommend it to anyone."
"Bidets in general, are surprisingly underrated and underutilized in the States. This one features nearly all of the latest design innovations available. The seat is comfortable for a 6ft 280 lbs man and even more comfortable for 180 lbs frame. You can even sit on the bidet lid, which is rare.

I have long history with digestive issues and for me, a bidet is essentially a requirement now a days. This allows me to use only toilet paper again Vs. needing several wet wipes. The water pressure is high and even capable of mini enemas if positioned correctly. The heater is instant, the quality is well above average and the bowl light is bright. Easy to install and looks fantastic overall.

The only feature I wish it had, was a bowl pre and post spray to coat the interior of toilet with sterile water before and after use. Other than that, it has evey feature needed, except power lid/seat lift, but I would never use that anyway.

The remote is flat and easy to clean, intuitively designed and aesthetically pleasing to eyes and touch. What makes this quality bidet stand out the most, is the phenomenal pricing. The only brand comparable is the Toto and the Toto is about double the price. This bidet is an unbelievable value from a quality, Canadian company with a hefty warranty and responsive customer support, which I also tested.

This also has oscillating spray heads, which may sound gimmicky, but is not, the oscillating heads allow you to cover much more area, so it is invaluable."
"Overall, a very disappointing experience. The seat certainly does not live up to the rave reviews I read on several different sites.

Installation was straightforward and easy.

First impression on sitting down was that the seat is extremely uncomfortable for me. The seat is slanted into the bowl somewhat sharply, and it feels very narrow and uncomfortable under the thighs. The seat also seems to narrow at the back, and does not hold me comfortably. The tank and other parts at the back nearly turn my elongated toilet into a round, losing much of the comfort from having the larger bowl.

I had a problem with programming the user controls, and the wands were not extending when the user settings were activated, just water dribbling out of the unextended wands for 2 minutes. I eventually solved this by reprogramming the settings.

I'm also dissatisfied with the function. I find that the wands don't really extend far enough to use comfortably. Using the front wand to rinse my rear gets close, but I still feel the need to lean forward to get properly positioned. Despite some water dribbling out before the spray starts, I still get a quick unpleasant spray of cold water before the heated water kicks in. The dryer seems mostly ineffective.

The remote seems to work well (apart from the previously mentioned user controls problem). Changes to settings (movement, temperature, pressure, etc.) happen quickly, and there's a big enough change in every setting level to notice the difference.

I'd really like to return it, but how do you return a lightly used bidet?"
"The Brondell 1400 Swatch is a great product. I recently purchased the Brondell Swash, and the Toto C200, and Overall the Brondell wins out on almost every category (I bought the brondell for 400 open box, and the Toto for 350).

The install for the Brondell was pretty straightforward, and the video provided on the website is all you need to walk through step by step and great. The Toto literally did not have anything in the instructions on how to install the unit, so I had to hit YouTube to get throtogh install.

The actual unit/Bidet with the Brondell is wonderful. Rear/Front has varying widths with the spray, so you can change the preciseness of the stream, and you quite honestly get a better cleaning from the Brondell than the Toto.

My only minor complaints about the Brondell are that the seat is a little bit thinner than the toto, which leads to the heated seat not being quite as effective (Its still great, and you wouldnt know unless you directly compared the Toto and Brondell, but the Toto's bigger seat makes a huge difference in this area. Also, the dry function on both units doesnt get you fully dry, which I think is just par for the course with these type of bidets.

Overall, I am very happy with the purchases and both units are great, but I recommend the Brondell over the Toto because it's just a little bit better than the Toto with the actual Bidet functions and experience."
"OK - So this is a pretty amazing item I am new to the bidet thing, and I have to say that this is pretty awesome. Installed very easily with clear instructions from the manual. I installed the needed GFCI receptacle while waiting for the item to arrive. This was easy as well. So far as the bidet goes:
1 - It is very full of features - Heated Seat, heated water, variable nozzles, variable spray patterns and pressures, and all can be saved to 2 different user pre-set buttons very easily via the remote control.
2 - This is sort of the cadillac of bidets in my mind and the best value for the money. As this is my entry unit, I did a decent amount of research and figured this would be the starting point and I did not want to sell myself short on anything - This has it all and I really could not think of anything else I would need.
3 - After setting it up, I ran it through all of the options, and am completely satisfied with it. My only complaint is that I may spend more time in the bathroom than previously, but I will have the cleanest posterior around due to this little beast of burden.
Brondell packages it well, clear descriptions and good instructions. If you are hesitant or not sure if you want to spend this much, trust me, you will be happy with the quality and the product."
"I have two Swash 1400s and both have the same issue of the water initially (for a second) coming out cold despite the heat setting for same -- seems that no matter what, it does not fully drain the water.

Other issues are common to all of the bidet seats I have tried, so it is just something to be aware of:
1) The dryers do not dry -- maybe if you sat for an unreasonably long time but best to hold onto your toilet paper for the drying.
2) Heaven forfend it needs repairs: you will need to hold onto the original packaging box and if possible, the original shipping box and packing material because it is large (and in charge) -- obtaining what you will need for that elsewhere is costly. If you are not handy or able, you will need someone to uninstall it, pack it, get it to the shipper to get to the manufacturer (all at your expense) and then reinstall it (also at your expense) when it is returned to you. I had my Swash 1000 for 8 months before it began leaking and had to go back for repairs for which a portion was covered by warranty -- but it was returned with a new issue of the smell of rubber or plastic burning or such when the dryer was turned on. They did offer to pay the shipping back and any repairs but it was not worth the cost of the uninstall, packaging and reinstall to me.

I have had one 1400 for ~8 months and the other for ~5 months. They both work well with no leaks so far and just that one issue of the initial cold shot as the water spray starts. When I spoke to customer support, they indicated that was odd and that they would escalate the matter to tech support and then never responded again when I followed up on that so I guess is a known issue that they cannot do anything about.

UPDATE: 3 Years later and both 1400s had the same issue: the front nozzle could no longer extend beyond a very short, useless distance. Since it had so many features that are unnecessary or sub-optimal (e.g. dryers are an expensive feature that really do nothing functionally unless you have some hours to sit and wait :) ), and I suspect the issues with the 1400s were due to the very hard water where I live, and there is the problem with Brondell customer service being poor before Covid and non-existent now, I opted for a Brondell that has the features I like and want without the many I do not need - the BL97 is half the price (of my original purchase of the 1400) and with much less that can go wrong... and if it does, at that price, it is easier to weigh whether to deal with poor customer service and expensive processes to return it for service."
With tougher BM hard to impossible to get completely clean.
"After a few trips to Japan in the last few years my wife and I quickly realized how outdated we were when it comes to toilet technology. We promised ourselves when we had the means to do so, we'd make the jump and this was our selection. We'd heard great things about other brands as well but were ultimately drawn to the features this Brondell Swash 1400 had and haven't been disappointed in the slightest. I was able to install this in less than 30 minutes with little to no knowledge of bathroom plumbing. Its a standout great looking product that has reliable features and relatively easy operation. Neither my wife or I have setup our user profiles as of yet, that may be the only area I think the remote could use a little work, its not entirely intuitive to setup of the profiles without the manual, but the features are all very easy to use without even having to setup a profile. My wife can be at times technologically challenged but she hit the ground running with this and loves it. We are ecstatic that we are now saving not only money on toilet paper, but keeping our dependency on paper that much lower. We highly recommend this Bidet Toilet seat to anyone that wants to take that step, but also benefit from some of the better features out there without spending $800-900+"
"While I've used bidets in the past (including in Asian countries) this is the first time I buy one for my home in the US.

I was looking for high quality, full features (primarily remote, temperature control, fan and oscilating nozzle). This product offered this and more.

From a product perspective, I think that the vendor could improve a few things, like for instance dim the night light ... small changes really because I find this now a must-have item in our house.

I spent probably weeks researching brands and can say with confidence that the Brondell S1400 is a keeper. A bit steep in price but not bad if paid in installments."
"Sounds silly, but i've learned to love the seat warmer. So nice not to be startled with the cold seat when I get up in the middle of the night in a cold house. The wash and dry work very well and it's completely adjustable. The remote is mounted on the wall next to the toilet and is easy to use.
You will need to have an electrical outlet installed near your toilet, if you don't already have one.
After having used it for about a year, I can tell you that I would not want to be without my Brondell bidet now."
"I've been using a basic luxe under the seat bidet model for years and have enjoyed it, but decided it was time to upgrade. After studying all the options, Brondell seemed like the best bang for my buck. I'll start off with the pros, night light is neat, deodorizing function is neat, heated water and heated seat work like gangbusters.

But, for me, some big cons, the round sized seat of this is just embarrassingly small. Round sized toilets are already small, when you install this, you lose what looks like almost a quarter of the toilet bowl to all the electronics and whatever is hidden in the bulky back end of the seat, and then the seat/opening on the Swash cuts that size down even more. It feels like a kid sized toilet at this point, maybe alright for ladies, but not a super comfortable fit for guys. Also I've always found plastic toilet seats uncomfortable, and that opinion remains unchanged with the Swash's seat. But the biggest deal breaker is I just don't feel I get as clean as I did with my more basic luxe bidet, I chalk it up in part to weak water pressure of the Swash compared to the Luxe.

I imagine the elongated version of the seat isn't as uncomfortable or awkward, and maybe the spray even works better when you're not in such a cramped little seat, but at the least, unless you're fairly petite, I'd really recommend you away from the round version of this device.

EDIT - July 2020; didn't quite make it 3 years for me. I don't know what the expectation is for bidets or electronics is these days, I feel like a $500+ toilet seat is a long term investment though, and 2.5 years doesn't quite match that expectation. Because its in the 3 year warranty, Brondell did take it in and offer to repair it at 50% cost, which came out to $150. The rational side of my brain tells me to just drop back to the $30 non-electric versions that clean better anyways. But the nagging side of my brain that is a sucker for the fallacy of sunk costs, and might convince me to drop the $150 so something this expensive doesn't just go to waste. Either way, having the thing break after 2 years sucks."
"I like this seat but it's not perfect. The seat is a little uncomfortable and small, the bidet cleaner isn't quite long enough. You can scoot back to get better coverage, but both my husband and I felt that it was not hitting the right area when you are sitting normally on the seat. The remote is ok, the memory is a nice feature. After you push the clean button, there is quite a long delay before the unit actually comes on and sprays water. Also when it first hits you the water is cool not warm. It does get warm right away but is kind of jarring. The Dryer feature is nice and warm but would take all day to really get you dry..... kind of a waste."
"Truly, the Brondell Swash 1400 Luxury Bidet Toilet Seat is the best purchase I've made to date. I had been looking for a ""bidet add on"" for my toilet for a very long time. Due to space restrictions I could not install an actual stand alone bidet. What held me back from a purchase in the past was the thought of having freezing cold water doing its thing, if you know what I mean. I was researching bidet's almost daily when I came upon the Brondell Swash 1400 bidet, and what really drew me in were the words ""continuous warm water"" and ""heated seat."" The Sanitize and Deodorize features for the bidet are awesome as well. I am a 68 year old woman with arthritic hands and I installed the bidet by myself; it was that easy. Living in the Northeast warmth is so important, especially in the bathroom! Believe me, you will not be disappointed with this purchase. My husband thought I was crazy when I told him what I bought. Since I installed the bidet, he has changed his tune. He said it was so relaxing he almost fell asleep. If I had a second bathroom, I would buy another one!!"
"I purchased my first Brondell Swash about 12 years ago, but got separated from me during a divorce. It was ""replaced"" 8 years ago when I was having bilateral carpal tunnel surgery. Definitely one of the best reasons to buy one ;). Unfortunately that one died recently ~ first the remote, then the hot water turned cold, then total loss of power and the seat was freezing! This particular model is available at a great price right now, so I did not hesitate to order one. I keep telling my friends how wonderful it is, but I still don't know anyone else who has a bidet seat. If you've been considering, can't beat the current price. Don't be afraid of it!!"
"Installation was extremely easy. Definitely a DYI job. Video on the website was great to assist with installation. The whole family is now using my bathroom instead of the other three. Cleans great for normal use. Apocalyptic incidents will require some clean up the old way in addition to the Bidet.
Would certainly recommend"
"This is a great bidet it has pretty much every feature you can imagine. I haven’t found any other bidet manufacturers that can compete with all the features. Especially the button that thoroughly sterilizes the nozzle.

Imagine this situation. You wake up, take a shower, and as soon as you leave the shower, you get the sudden urge to poop. In a normal situation, you would be mortified by the idea of a post shower poop; but with the brondell, you don’t have to worry about the dreaded feeling of walking around all day with a sub par butt cleansing. You’ll walk around the rest of the day without even thinking about your post shower poop.

While the seat has a lot of features, I am looking forward to the day that brondell adds the following features to this toilet:
1. Pre-mist to prevent poop from sticking to the bowl
2. Automatic deodorizer when you sit down so you don’t have to hit a button."
"I purchased this unit after doing a bit of research - I wanted my next bidet toilet seat to be built at a higher level than my last one - a SmartBidet which barely made it to 2 years before dying. I've installed the Brondell 1400 & am going through the remote setup. The instruction manual is well laid out & easy to fallow. The only shortcoming I'm seeing is that the seat ergonomics has been built for smaller folks from Korea - where its made. The seat seems to be on the small side. The problem isn't on the front but on the back. Due to the units hardware, the back part of the seat ' begins ' nearly 3 in. ' inside ' of the base toilet bowl that it sits on - which results in just less space / hole size of the seat. This forces me forward & for me - a man - there is not much wiggle room. After my wife gives it a try I'll see what she says."
"Ever since I moved back from Asia, I have been wanting a bidet toilet seat. I finally bought one.

It is very good at cleaning one's backside.

The seat itself is very comfortable. The heating of the seat is very nice for the cold nights when the heat of the house is turned down.

The nightlight is very handy at night to find the toilet without having to turn the lights on.

The water jet sprays at a comfortable pressure and the oscillating back and forth does a very good job of cleaning up after my business.

While the heated dryer does a fairly good job, you will still need to use two squares of toilet paper to finish the drying. Unless you want to spend a fair amount of time waiting for it to dry completely. If you want to wait for it to dry completely, then you can spend your time catching up on your reading. ;)

I would recommend it to anyone. Especially for men. I have had no skidmark incidents since I have owned it. I cannot talk for women, but it does have the positioning for dealing with that ""not so fresh"" feeling."
"After using the Swash 1400 for a few weeks, I must say that I like it. Everything from the quality of its construction through the ease of installation to the easy and effective operation is excellent. The heater does not fully dry hard-to-reach areas, but that isn't surprising. A quick pat down with toilet tissue easily solves that problem. I find the narrow water stream to be a bit aggressive, but the wider two settings work very well. The elongated seat is about an inch shorter than our toilet's opening. Were the Swash 1400 a bit longer, it would be more accommodating, but it's adequate as is. All said, it's worth the price."
"My mother had an older Swash model that worked well for over 15 years. The nearest equivalent model was the 1400, which added stainless steel wash heads and LED light. The old remote was a panel that attached to the wall near the seat. This new model is outstanding. The new remote is more like a TV remote (dumb idea) but it uses button batteries, which don't leak inside the unit. The old wash heads were plastic and had to be frequently cleaned to keep from getting stuck. The 1400 stainless steel heads are not only self cleaning, but they can be adjusted using the remote and moved back and forth also using the remote. My mom quickly adapted to the new remote and just loves the LED light. What will they think of next.... a seat that sings?"
"Bought this a s a birthday present for my wife, she just loves it! doesn't do much for me but I sure got the brownie points for this!"
"In home experience with the Brondell Swash 1400 was nothing but problem after problem. Our first unit suffered leakage where the water hose connects to the bidet seat. I had hand-tightened the connection without any success. This unit was returned to AMAZON who then sent us a replacement unit. This unit did not suffer from leakage. However, as with the 1st unit, the warm temperature suffered from extreme variation in temperature, going anywhere from cold to very hot. After about a week, the unit turned itself off while in use due to internal over-temperature safety feature. I was shocked by the extreme temperature. When this occurred several days later, I decided that this unit also was defective. At this point, Brondell offered to send me a 3rd unit telling me I did not have to return the unit to AMAZON for a refund. Brondell said they would take care of everything if the 3rd unit did not work out. Stupidly, I went along with that. As It turns out, the 3rd unit leaked water exactly like the 1st unit and the temperatures varied wildly. I did try to put plumber's tape on the water inlet connector without any success. It is virtually impossible to install this tape due to the location of the connector. Bad engineering!

At that stage, I decided to return the unit to Brondell for a refund. Incredibly, Brondell told me they did not have the money for a refund since my ORIGINAL purchase was with AMAZON. I had pointed out this potential issue to Brondell when they offered to send me the 3rd unit. In any case, It was then well past the 30 day return window. What was I to do? I ended up taking my case to AMAZON & they were gracious enough to issue a refund. I put way too many hours into installing & reinstalling the units while following Brondell's directions/suggestions. My body took a beating working so many hours in a confined space. Then there was waiting to see if anything worked. Unfortunately, nothing did.

Brondell has maintained that they tested all units & that they were all functioning properly. I don't buy this for one minute. I am now the owner of a competitor's bidet toilet seat comparable to the SWASH 1400. It does not leak & temperatures are very stable."
"Product works great! Wished it fit our commode better, we have American Standard one piece commode and it's slightly off set. It still seals the water in but....
Love the remote and all the options. I had back surgery and needed this because of no bend or twisting. It works great! Watch for a sale and you shouldn't be disappointed!"
"To paraphrase a Beatles song: Happiness is a warm bumm!

We just entered the brave new world of bidets! After researching many brands, we selected the Swash 1400 due to its advanced features. Paramount in our selection were the continuous warm water, dryer fan, heated seat, and remote control. So far, our experience has been great! The bidet seat was sturdy, very easy to install and easy to learn to use. We couldn’t stand the thought of being washed by cold water, or having the warm water run out and turn cold mid-stream. The Swash 1400 didn’t disappoint! And, the ability to adjust the water and air temp and the wash location was as advertised. We are now confirmed bidet users! If there is a down side, there are two: cost and electrical supply. The 1400 is pricey, but the features make it worth it (remember warm bumm!). There is the added cost of adding electrical outlet, if one is not already in close proximity."
"This is my first bidet and I really like it. However, I have two gripes. The first is that the toilet cover (lid) significantly slopes forward. I've always used the toilet with the lid down as a chair for putting on my socks and shoes because our walk-in closet is accessible via the bathroom. Now, I have to be careful to not slide off. I understand the the mechanism is at the rear of the seat and it requires height, but I wonder if they could have provided a clever solution the lid closing geometry. I'm 6'2"" so I don't mind a tall toilet.

My other grip is that the nozzle position does not seem to be saved with the other settings. I always have to readjust it after starting the Auto cycle. I've tried storing the settings several times to no avail."
"I used to order the flushable wipes by the box. I just don't know how people can feel clean with only using dry paper! I ordered this about a year ago after researching several brands and models and decided on this for all of the features. :) I am so glad I chose this one. A year later and it still works great, I love everything about it. The only thing that doesn't work the greatest is the dry function.... unless you plan on sitting there twiddling your thumbs for quite some time... Just remember to replace the filter for the deodorizer... i thought it had quit working until I figured out there is a filter that needs to be replaced. The water is the correct temperature and it's sooo nice having a heated seat... you will dread having to go anywhere else and will want all your friends and family to have one at their house too. ;) I am a single female and I was able to install this myself so the installation is simple and other than replacing that cartridge I haven't done a single thing to it and it is still working great."
"My husband and I had two cheap cold water bidets, but really wanted to upgrade to one with different water temps, heated seat, air dryer, etc.
We studied the different brands and ultimately decided on this one because of an absolutely brilliant review someone had given.
We paid someone to come to our house to install and additional power outlet so that we could install the bidet.
We loved the night light, heated seat and air dryer, but two weeks after installation, my husband is reinstalling the $35 cold water bidet. All that money down the drain because it had zero water pressure… none. Even on the highest setting there was not enough water to clean. Save your money and buy a cheaper one."
I've never had a bidet before or ever used one but it came highly recommended to me from someone who has. I figured I was missing out on something pretty useful so I purchased it. It does everything it is supposed to and does it well. I really like the blue light too and the remote has all the options you would ever need. I like that the lid is sitable and the unit seems well made and sturdy. I am a true amateur when attempting to install or fix anything and have to watch Youtube videos to accomplish anything I attempt but I did manage to get it installed. I had to watch a video first to know how to take the old toilet seat off. All went well with the installation until I turned the water back on and it leaked. I asked my husband to help me which I was trying not to do and he said I just didn't tighten down the connections enough. After he did that it didn't leak at all. I am happy with my purchase and find the appliance useful.
"Hello, got this washlet about 2 months ago while remodeling downstairs bathroom. Now, we are only using that bathroom. It works great. We truly enjoy warmed seat and having clean butts. I do not see one single issue with that. We will e remodeling upstairs bathroom shortly and I will get one more for that room as well."
"Toilet is great so far. It does its job, period.

But we ordered the round, and the order was changed ( unethical ) and they sent the elongated. They charged me, of course, for the round which was a higher cost. They owe me $53. They have made no attempt to contact me about it. Reseller gets a zero. The toilet gets at least 4 stars, and maybe a 5. I will change this review once the reseller contacts me and fixes the issue."
"I personally had never before used a bidet, even when I was in in Europe. However, my wife had used them. This one is GREAT! Heated water, heated seat, heated air, nozzle moves, water pressure changes, and the temperature of the seat goes up or down as needed. It saves the settings for two different people. The only ""drawback"" such as it is is that the opening of the seat is not as large as the opening in a normal toilet seat. If you have a large rear end - like me - you might notice the difference. The first time I purchased this product my wife made me send it back without even opening the package but then she did some reading and LOVES it now.

It requires a GFI plug so there must be something nearby to the toilet for you to run one from. If you are not fairly competent working with electricity plan on having an electrician do it for you.

I plan on getting two more for the other toilets in my house."
"Not much I can add from all the other reviews except that I love it, and didn't think I would.
Warm toilet seats are great! The remote control works perfectly.
The different spray patterns ensures you leave super clean.
Love it so much, I'll get another for our 2nd bathroom.
I can't believe I waited all these years to get a bidet.
Never again will I get a 'code red' hiney hole situation, where your hole itches so bad you feel like you could dig the skin off!
No more going after code reds with warm washcloths! No more skid marks!
No more stink! Nothing but a 100% clean, fresh, hiney hole!
If you're still using toilet paper, you smell like ass and nobody's telling you.
Baby wipes, ARE NOT flushable, no matter what the label says! Ask any professional plumber, they'll agree.
The Brondell 1400 is the Cadillac of bidet seats. Get one. You need it and don't even know it."
What I like is being clean. I like the options for temp of water and temp of air drying. What I didn't like was how much my electric bill went up when I had the heated seat on all the time. I am not able to afford that.
"Lifesaver!! Underwent shoulder surgery, and knew I would be unable to perform normal paper cleanups during recovery. This unit worked perfectly: washing and then blow drying. In recovery at the moment, but thankfully no longer concerned about cleanliness thanks to this unit. In fact, I am likely to buy another for the other commode in my home simply for daily use. One thing you should be aware of, tho, is that the unit will warm the water spray to your chosen temperature and try to also warm the blown air for you. I keep the water temps at cool, since 'no warming' is uncomfortably cold straight out of the cold water tap (which is the only water connection you will be making). However, when it tries to warm the air, it does so by heating the water and blowing the air (somehow) over that heat - and then circulating the hot water thru the seat unit. The seat can get uncomfortably hot, so press the minus '-' key 3 or 4 times to let unheated air do the drying. Everything else is just great!!"
"We purchased our first Swash 1400 3 weeks ago. The installation was simple, but you have to be careful with the plumbing connections and check for leaks. OK. Beyond the installation lies a transformation I never expected. We have been transported out of the dark ages of toilet paper, etc. and into the modern age of superb South Pole hygiene! I'll never go back!!! EVER!!! Beginning with a warm seat during cold winters in Wisconsin to the deodorizer which really works you're off to a good start. Following evacuation, expect a warm pleasant adjustable cleaning that does a fantastic job. The air dryer is perfect and leaves you fresh and clean. NO TOUCHING REQUIRED. Seriously. I loved the first seat so much, I bought a second one and installed it today. 2 bathrooms down and one to go. I hope I win an additional Brondell seat!!! I'm sold. As a physician specializing in anal diseases I recommend everyone use this technology. You will enjoy an amazing transformation in health down there. BRAVO!"
"I only have had this bidet for 2 weeks now. It was fantastic at first, but it completely stopped working after only 14 days. I am going through the return process now, but as it isn't sold and shipped by Amazon, they cannot replace the item. I have to refund the item and order a new one, which ends up being a pain if you utilize the prime credit card as I do for 0% APR payment options on products. The refund money will go directly to your payment installment balance, and WILL NOT go towards the replacement product purchase. All in all, this has not been a pleasant experience. I can only hope that I was unlucky and received a rare defective product and that my replacement will work fine for a long time."
"Update#2!! Over 2 years now and works just as good as when I bought it, still haven't had to replace batteries. Amazing considering it gets used twice a day or more.

Update!! Had this unit over a year now and works great. Best purchase I’ve made in a long time..

I researched for a month and read a lot of reviews and I really glad I decided to go with this model, I also replaced the toilet with the one piece glacier model they show in most of the pictures as they look great together. The most important feature on this model is the unlimited heated water supply, the drying function is great but you still have to use a dab of toilet paper to dry off.
Also the 3 year warranty was a huge factor in my decision as well, I called Brondell customer service before I purchased to make sure it would still be under warranty if purchased through Amazon and they said yes as long as it was not from a third party seller, they answered the phone right away and had great customer service."
"I first experienced this product when visiting family in New Orleans and loved it! I live in Duluth, the climate opposite of NOLA and found the warmed seat not as warm in cold Duluth! A warm toilet seat when the temperature is 75 feels a whole lot different when it’s -15! Nonetheless, this is a great product. The water pressure is fine, the temperature is good, the remote control works well albeit if a person is in a hurry, the water doesn’t come on instantly!
I now use a towel to dab if need be since the nether regions are so clean!"
"Like everyone here, I never thought I would review a toilet seat. Like everyone here, I depended on the reviews for help. My turn to help others decide.

I thought I was just buying something that would be a mild improvement on a regular one. Never thought it would compare to the real bidet in my wife's br. In Florida we don't really consider heated seats or other fluff. I was so wrong. To my astonishment, I really love this seat. The jet is powerful and quite adjustable. Heated water! Now that it's cooler here, the heated seat is great. It's sturdy and well built. I was expecting a cheap plastic junk.

It was easy to install. Waiting on a new outlet but just using an extension cord for the time being. Had to buy a flexible supply line. Don't overtighten!

In general, there appears to be issues with bidets being durable. Can't comment on that yet.

After looking at reviews and comparing seats, I settled on the 1400. Extremely happy and very pleasantly surprised. I strongly recommend it."
"I purchased the top of the line 1400 seat before our house was completed due to the fact that the covid pandemic was causing order back logs. Almost 2 years after my purchase, due to covid delays, my house was finished and I installed the seat. Yes it is a very beautiful home and took years to build. 1 WEEK after installing the seat I found a leak coming from inside the seat. Supposedly there was a ThreeYear Waranty on the seat so I called and was told I would have to pay for shipping and repairs. After complaining on the phone, Brondell sent me a FedEx mailing label. After about two weeks I was told the heating unit was bad and I had to pay $150.00 in repair fees.
I told Brondell to keep the piece of junk.
On top of all this it never worked well. The spray nozzle wouldn’t hit the spot and adjustments were minimal too none.
If I had known Brondell was out of San Francisco, I never would have bought it.
I was treated like a fool and a liar.
Since this bad purchase fiasco I have purchased a Kohler bidet seat and I love it.
DO NOT BUY BRONDELL!!!"
I feel much cleaner after using my bidet! It was easy to install and it works well!
"We love this bidet and the only regret I have is that we didn't get one sooner. Especially when my sister was having back problems. It was easy to install. I have arthritis, can't kneel or bend down for long. It took me a while because of those issues. I had to take a break in between steps. I'd say if I didn't have to take breaks, it would have been installed in less than 30 minutes. The most difficult part was emptying the water from the toilet tank. That is how easy it was. I bought an extension cord and one of those cord track you stick on the wall to control the cords. I'd do it again."
"Heating element malfunctioned within first week. Customer service was great. Sent it back and had it repaired within about a week. So have now been using this for over a year. Definitely beats using leaves and sticks to do the same job. One intermittent problem that crops up is that the cycle sometimes interrupts. Other times, the water warmer doesn't work properly giving you either cold or very hot water. Just had that happen and thought I'd revise this review. Quite a shock getting really hot water squirted up your hoo-ha.

This has been used over a thousand times, the misfires have happened maybe a half dozen times so you can make your own decision on whether this is a deal killer or not.

Still mostly satisfied with this purchase."
"It was very easy to install and came with all of the parts you need unlike some of the other brands like Tushy.

The electronics portion of the seat takes up about the 1/3 of your entire bowl. We even have an elongated bowl and it still took up a substantial amount of area.

The controls area are easy but it takes about 1 to 2 minutes before the bidet kicks in after you hit start. The water stream is very mellow like a water fountain, whereas Tushy’s was much stronger. I personally prefer a little stronger. The deodorizer and drawer aren’t that effective and seem a little gimmicky to be honest. The rest is great and performs well enough to keep."
"I had a previous version of this bidet which lasted more than 5 years. It was a five star product. Once that product went end of life I ordered the newest model, but unfortunately it lasted less than a month.
I reached yo the manufacturer customer support, but they were unable to solve the problem over the phone. The only option they offered me was to ship the product and stay with a naked toilet for several days or weeks; luckily Amazon agreed to send a replacement instead and send them the broken product later. Five stars to Amazon customer service!
I will update this rating if the replacement unit last a few extra months.
Updated 11/7/2022:
I eventually ordered a new one, which lasted just seven months. My interactions with their customer support service are very frustrating, they take 3-4 days to respond to my messages, the responses involve new questions about my address, the actual problem, etc. I reply to their questions within an hour or two, then they sent a new question 3-4 days later. I was hoping they were going to send me instructions for how to ship the product for repair, but nothing was sent so far…"
"This is, in theory, a fantastic bidet/toilet seat. A lot of great features on paper, but multiple units have suffered from water heating problems. The first unit was able to dispense heated water ONCE (the first time we tried the unit), before it refused to spray any water if the any water temp setting other than ""off"" was selected. I did an exchange through Amazon, and upon setting up the second unit, we have now encountered another, albeit less severe, issue with the water heating capability.

The new unit is not able to provide a consistent stream of heated water for more than 2-3 seconds, regardless of the spray width or temp selected. Additionally, the unit suffers from the widely reported immediate cold water blast (even when you can hear the water heater working prior to spraying). The final issue I am having is that the water temp will wildly swing from moderate to scalding, and back to moderate, within a span of a few seconds. A TON of water temp issues with both units is a bad sign of a larger design problem.

Frustratingly, I purchased the mount kit and alternative valve that allows me to install this on a skirted toilet, so I have sunk additional money into this seat.

Before there are assumptions that I must be doing something wrong to have two seats malfunction similarly, both seats were installed by a familial plumber. We also had the (new construction) GFCI outlets and wiring checked to ensure it was not an electrical fault. These issues are on Brondell.

If someone from Brondell can reach out directly to get this solved, I would appreciate it. But for now, I would recommend looking elsewhere for a similar product."
"I am very pleased. The 1400 was easy to install and simple to use. It is a bit different, now, without actually needing TP, but it does what needs to be done in much better fashion and with more comfort. How did I live without one? I attach a picture which shows one of the two water tubes extended during a self-clean mode.

Regarding the bidet operation, it is very comfortable and thorough. The only thing I can think of improving is that the built-in seat heater does not automatically turn off in eco mode when the bidet is not in use; if the heater was on, it goes to low heat when not in use. This is not a problem, as I can turn it off with the remote, but I have to remember."
"When I revealed I had ordered my Brondell 1400, I became the subject of joking around by my adult children, and my wife. However, now that it's installed everyone wants to try it! It was very easy to install; Had no leaking connections and blends well into our bathroom! On multiple occassions, I've heard family members state they did not want to assist our elderly family members with the ""Paperwork"" of using the restroom! I was one of them. We recieved our Brondell on my 68th, and a week before my wife's 68th B'day. I already suffer from dupytrens contracture, and some arthritis and in my hands. I'm hoping if I progress to the point where ""wiping"" is beyond my capabilities, that being a convert from ""wiping to washing"" will make it so my joking family members will be grateful I made the switch. In the mean time, I'm enjoying the luxury and comfort of my new Brondell bidet, and telling the wife to cut back on those bulk purchases of TP!"
"We recently moved into a condo from our home of 32 years where we enjoyed use of a full sized standard bidet. We were indeed sold on use of a bidet for daily hygienic health. However, Installing the same type unit in our new home was out of the question, cost and plumbing wise, After extensive research I selected the Brondell 1400, installed it myself with the easy instructions, and have been using it for the last two months. During that time I underwent a total hip replacement. The Brondell 1400 has completely taken care of my sanitary needs in the most satisfactory manner during this time when time on the toilet was a major undertaking because of the movement and posture prohibitions ordered after the surgery. Use of water temp, stream size, position were instrumental in helping me clean up with little left to do after using this bidet. Kudos to the designers for such a useful and necessary part of my daily routine.! . Alex Creighton, Lincoln, MA"
"I've had this unit for three months and love it. I had been wanting to leave a review right from the start because it worked so well, but thought it better to give use of this product some time before commenting in case it didn't stand up to my initial take. I had been having perianal issues, to the extent that I had seen a doctor and after adhering to her suggestions was better but still not ""cured"" of the itching and burning that flared up from time to time. I had reached the point where I was about to return to the Dr's. office and perhaps surgery, but before taking that step bought this bidet. My ""issues"" have been resolved and I am very happy with this product."
"This bidet seat is not bad and, certainly, better than most. The profile is lower (not the lowest). Because it is not the tightest profile, the opening of the seat is not as large as it should be. It is essentially the size opening of a normal round toilet seat. The water pressure and nozzle spray pattern is great. This may be it's best feature. The overall construction seems a little flimsy. I am a big guy so it is probably more than sufficient for most people. It is ok for me but just seems like it could be a little more stout. The endless warm water ability is good, but there is a split second when it first starts that is, relatively, cold until the warm water flows out. Lastly, the remote control technology could be a bit more with the times in terms of interface. However, that is pretty much par for the course for all bidet manufacturers. If you are looking for the best bidet seat on the market right now, hands down it is the Toto S350e. It costs more, but you get what you pay for. If you want to spend a little less, this bidet seat is still pretty good."
"Decided to take a chance on this because I had a couple of gift cards. Always wanted a heated toilet seat and this one is so much more. I installed it myself and my husband was impressed. So easy to install. Love the warmed water, pressure and temp controls, and dryer. Still need a bit of tp to dry but that’s ok. No need for those “flushable wipes” that are really bad on the septic system (learned the hard way!) The warmed seat is great. Should have bought this years ago!"
"First let me say WOW! I wish I had bought a bidet a long time ago. It truly makes the experience an enjoyable one. I started to give this 4 stars...but I think my only qualm is not with the product, but bidets overall. The only negative is, unless you want to sit there for a half an hour to get completely dry, you’ll still likely to use some toilet paper...although a hand towel could do just fine if you could get over using it to wipe the wetness of the area. Works excellent for 90 percent of your bathroom movements. you’ll soon figure out those times it doesn’t. Had been looking at getting one for some time, but the current situation made me pull the trigger. Does require an outlet. I’m sure that will be a standard add on for new and remodel homes in the future. Highly recommend."
"I just had one of these installed a week ago. Wow! It works swell! I find my self wanting to sit on my bidet all day long, hahah! I feel clean and refreshed, though a little wet. That is one of the minor reasons I gave it 4 stars. It doesn't dry very well and the dryer temperature is cool at best. Mine does not seem to warm much, if any. So I use paper and that's fine by me. It also leaves the back of the toilet seat a bit sprinkled, but that to is quickly dried with a bit of TP. I can do without the night light. Over all...Fantastique!!!! Wish I had one for my other bathroom!"
"My son purchased a Blondell toilet seat last year and has been after me to purchase one. I did the research and I purchased the top of the line Blondell Swash 1400 Bidet Toilet Seat. It is truly awesome. It washes, cleans and dries the area with little or no need for any toilet paper. The Swash 1400 heater works well. It also has a deodorizer which works wonders. I wish I would have purchased this bidet years ago. Our family likes it so much that I purchased another Swash 1400 for our other bathroom. They are expensive, but do everything that Blondell says it will do. It is well made and easy to install. I would recommend it to anyone."
Great seat Would buy again.
"This is specifically for the EB800 model: Once you start adding control panels and wireless remotes and blow dryers these things start getting absurdly complicated and don't last. I was happy to find one that was heated water and seat only. The price premium is worth it over vowel-soup amazon brands. The attachment mechanism is the best and most secure I've seen on any toilet seat.

My only complaint, is the manual is worthless. I feel like it was put through google translate a few times. It covers multiple models but doesn't actually say that it does. The manual tells you both that it has and does not have a heated seat, and tells you the heat has ""4 gears"" meaning four settings. Very silly."
Easy to install and works great!
"Play Video
 It doesn't fit well on my standard sized round toilet. The seat needs too much clearance in the back to open up. The hole doesn't match my toilet. I needed to use PTFE tape to keep the hose from leaking. The sprayers and/or internal hoses leak for minutes following use (I also have a pressure valve to prevent high-pressured water in the bidet, so it shouldn't leak at all). I also had to use other bidet hardware to secure the seat since the plastic 'expansion nuts' didn't fit into the holes in my toilet. We will see how long it lasts before it leaks internally (I have yet to find a non-electric bidet that doesn't leak).

I don't know what kind of toilet Moen made this crap for, but it's certainly not the standard round size/shape."
"Update 10/28: after buying the right connectors, and needing to use Teflon tape and tightening way more than seemed safe it worked ok for a couple months. Probably used 25 times? Came home today to it leaking from inside the unit onto the floor. It’s w here the plastic threaded piece connects to something. I tried tightening it and pushing it in and finally cracked worse. I’m thinking maybe it always had a hair fracture that got worse. Might take it apart and see if it’s fixable but what an absolute piece of crap. $20 would be a more reasonable price.

Edit 2: will see if moen will send me replacement piece. That piece has so much lateral movement when torqued that it just cracked rather than bend the plastic pipe. Still there was a leak coming from somewhere before I tightened so I’m just not sure what I was supposed to do. Still think there was probably pre existing crack.

Out of the last five or so products I got from Amazon that interfaced with my faucets and toilets water supply this is the first not to fit. It is approx double the size of my current fixtures. My place was built in the 50’s and remodeled in the 80’s. Even without the water fixture issue. (I had to get new t and adapter for moen fixtures.) Anyway it’s all a lot for something u can get easier and cheaper and better in an add on."
"Product page needs fixed, as this is not electronic in any way, although it looks like it should/could be. It's like they're being too careful since so many people get the electronic versions only to complain about needing an electrical outlet...

Anyway, this very much looks and feels like a super-high end American Standard-branded direct Japanese rebrand that I have which is electronic. The seat plastic is extremely similar.

Now, all the toilets in my new (for me) old house are the round kind instead of the elongated kind that I believe have become more normal in the States due to people getting larger. It seems to me that this seat is trying to fit both types, but I just can't put it back far enough on my toilet to keep it from hanging over in the front by about a half inch. It seems like I should be able to get it back further, but then the seat won't slide into the mounts. The mounts are odd, but if you crank the screws down enough, they finally stay in place.

Better than my electronic version is that it is much thinner and doesn't look quite as weird. It sort of looks more natural than the cheap add-on bidets since you don't have an extra piece sitting under the seat, but I sometimes wonder if I just like a regular, non-plastic seat better.

I am happy with this, though, that the self-closing mechanism works very well for both ups and downs, but the lid also stays up easily, whereas that was always an issue with my electronic version.

The hardware all seems very good with this (and is metal), which is better than most of the add-on types.

The water spray is definitely much better than the four or five brands of add-on's I've used. And it has front and back for those who need it (some add-ons have that now). But I feel I get the same clean from this very comfortably, whereas most add-on's can be a very sharp spray until it feels clean. This one also manages to have the arms retract and all that solely through water pressure.

The electronic ones have more features, of course, but have plenty of drawbacks of their own. It's hard to pick a favorite, but that's maybe because none of them are perfect. If this fit perfect, I might like it best.

Oh, this - like the electronic model I keep comparing it to - covers a bit of the back of the bowl, which is not ideal for bad aimers. I think this is not as obstructive, and probably more along the lines of what an add-on is like. But it's still something to consider.

I'm guessing the perfect bidet really only comes built into a fancy new toilet, but then, it really better be perfect, because you're stuck with it anyway..."
"If you don’t mind the cold water by this one! Great pressure, front and rear ….easy to use non-obtrusive."
"Moen bidet is one of a few that is long enough to cover the elongated toilet bowl.
It is sensibly designed for ease of cleaning and operation (seat surface is one piece). Competing bidets have splits on the seat that may accumulate dirt and are difficult to clean."
This is a good buy for your buck not a powerful spray but it gets the job done and it's a quality made product nice design and very durable
"We ordered the Moen EB1500-EBS biscuit colored bidet for elongated toilets. Easy to install and works well, lots of options for operation. we like the heated seat and heated water for comfort, definitely better than the cold water from other units.

Down sides:
1. the pictures shows a warm air dryer function which is missing in the unit we received. we paid for the warm air dryer but didn't get it, very disappointed in the bait and switch. be aware that at least some of the units being shipped are missing that function even though the Amazon listing shows it is included.

2. all plastic construction including plumbing fitting on the unit itself, you have to be careful with installation cause plastic is weak compared to brass or metal and you can strip it or tighten it too much. otherwise we didn't experience any leaks after installation.

3. unit stays on all the time so it likely has a significant vampire electrical load but it needs to for the remote control and night light functions to work. just be aware of that."
"Have 3 toilets at home, one is a perfect fit, another one fit but cant open the lid completely and the basement one dont fit at all. The plastic connector dont feel very strong."
"Easy to install, works very well. Reading some of the low rated reviews and thinking these people need to either change their diets or just run a garden hose into their bathrooms. Lol."
Not a comfortable seat. Put you on an uncomfortable angle. Pushing you forward. The water strength couldn’t knock a mosquito off of wall. Very disappointing. You’re better off buying a separate bidet attachment versus this all in one. Definitely not worth the money.
Wasn’t hard to install and it’s working as described. Pretty happy with the product.
"My husband thought that this would be easier for him after have major back surgery.
But then you get what you pay for!
Thanks to this CHEAP product. The unit will not stay seated where it was installed. He slipped off the toliet! Buyer Beware!!"
"It looks like a nice unit, thinking about keeping it and buying a new toilet in my basement. The lid will not go up all the way if I adjust the seat to the bowl. If I adjust it for the seat to work, the seat sticks out in front. Should work on large round bowls with the tank set back. Should work on elongated bowls. And yes, I made sure I got the right one"
This was nothing as advertised . Tried to give it a shot anyway but it has cheap installation parts that didn’t work well. Has only 2 settings on dial
I returned this bidet since it leaked. The plastic screw that connect the water to the seat is poor quality and impossible to tighten a metal screw to a plastic connection. It bends when tighten and leaks.
"The back hinge area on this bidet requires too much clearance between the mounting holes and the tank to fit on our toilet. Considering the price, I definitely can't recommend this one. Even the fancier, electric models from Toto or Biobidet fit our toilets, so I didn't expect this basic Moen to require so much extra depth."
" *update as of 9/12/2023

So I've begun trying out some other bidet designs without the heat option. I've used the original tushy design that inserts under the seat which was a pain because you need to purchase separate adhesive bumpers for under the seat to make them operate best. I installed a separate spray nozzle in my camper with some mods and now this one I installed at my moms for her. In order to get a safe cleaning for women in the front you must clean your booty hole first by holding your back straight vertical. Then lean forward to clean the front... Disregard my screaming I was trying to show the feature of this bidet that allows women to clean their front."
"I fell in love with the concept of bidets a few months ago and purchased a small add-on unit. I decided to upgrade to an integrated toilet seat bidet and being the Moen brand I honestly expected a lot better. Installation was straightforward however you’ll need an adjustable wrench and Phillips screwdriver which is not included. It includes a stainless steel braided water line and the adapter as well as the toilet bowl hardware itself. It only took about 15 minutes to install. I have a standard size toilet and this overlaps the basin by a solid inch. I can’t move it any further back because the lid doesn’t fully open. It’s too far back against the tank already. I had to double check my order to make sure I didn’t receive an elongated unit by accident. The seat itself has a very large rim along the backside and when you lift it and there’s a large shelf that can easily collect splashes when the guys use the toilet. The lid itself is just ridiculously oversized and overly complicated. The control itself doesn’t include a cleaning option but both nozzles are protected and retract the into housing. I’m not sure why the water flow is so drastically different from my last one, but even at high flow it’s half the pressure of my last unit. To turn it off you have to get it completely vertical and there’s no adjustment of the spray nozzles themselves which is baffling. Rotating forward does the feminine wash and rotating backwards does the rear wash but most bidets include two separate switches for these. Overall, I just really expected better being Moen and I’m really disappointed. I will probably be switching back to my old unit."
"Overall, this toilet seat/bidet combo is good looking, easy to install, quiet, and works awesome! I never would have thought a small upgrade such as a new toilet seat, could have such a “big upgrade” feel. I now understand what all the rage has been about and the environmental impact with saving paper is a great bonus too.

It’s worth mentioning though for anyone considering this for their own home, that I do have a couple queries with this that easily could have been prevented had the product description been accurate;
1. This is not an electric add on - it uses a basic waterline connection that is controlled with a single knob, that happens to be build into a toilet seat.
2. “Fits most round toilets in the United States” - I would say it is mostly for toilets with more of an oval bowl shape… unfortunately, I have a true “round” toilet bowl and therefore this does not fit perfectly. Had there been more details on size or shape, I would have likely skipped this for something that fit better. My suggestion for improvement on this would be for the company to add a bit more detail on size/fit or even a birds eye view of the toilet shape this fits would be helpful.

Alas, I went ahead and installed it anyway considering we are upgrading our toilets in the near future anyway (to ones that happen to have the right shape) and my previous lid drives me bonkers with it slamming shut. Installation was a breeze!! The instructions are clear and they provide two methods for water hose installation. When the lid is closed, you can hardly tell it doesn’t fit perfectly and the fit luckily does not compromise the functionality. Being non-electric actually ended up working out better for this particular bathroom anyway, as there isn’t a power outlet immediately available next to the toilet and I would have needed to install one or use it in a different bathroom."
"This is a pretty basic bidet toilet seat. It does not have a remote or connect to electricity. There is no way to warm the water. The installation is very straight forward and simple. Just make sure you have an elongated toilet bowl that can accommodate this bidet. Also, learn from our mistake and check to make sure your water supply has the correct size of connector for the water supply tube. Our house has the original water supply fixtures from the 1960s. I think a more modern plumbing set up probably will work out better, We have 3 toilets in our house, and all of the water supply connectors were too small to use this. I am sure there must be an adaptor, but we don't have the plumbing skills to sort that out. We are having a bathroom remodel done later this year, and will have the toilet water supply unit upgraded so that we can actually try to use this bidet. We will report back and let you all know how it works out."
"This manual bidet seat from Moen is very simple and does not have a lot of the fancy features that other electric bidets include. If you just want a bidet for rinsing purposes, this would be a good option. It fits on my toilet pretty well, but hangs over the front slightly. It's a bit more oval than I thought it was going to be. The lid has a slow close, which is very helpful with little kids. Installation was fairly simple and the instructions are well-written and easy to follow, even if you aren't super familiar with plumbing work. There are two positions for the sprayer, for the front or back and then the water pressure can be adjusted. Everything is controlled by one dial so it's simple to operate and to switch between the different modes. There is an extra piece that remains down even when the seat is lifted up and if you have any little kids, it is basically a given that that piece will need to be cleaned often. Also, since this is not electric at all, the water cannot be heated so just be prepared for cold water. Overall, this is a simple bidet with basic features that is easy to install and leaves you feeling clean."
"My toilet seat was broken so I was just looking for a nice replacement, not really a bidet seat. I always think of Moen to be top quality, so I went with this one. I was a little worried at first because the plastic pegs that are supposed to fit through the back of the actual toilet, near the bowl, to hold this in place, didn't fit, too wide. I had to cut them in half and rig it a bit for it to hold. Then, because of how long the seat is, it goes over my toilet rim half an inch. At first I didn't think the hose would fit, so I had to do that a little differently too. After all that, at least it works. It is a comfortable seat which was all I was looking for. The bidet works well and it's very simple to operate. Nice to know it's there if it's ever needed! I'm content with it."
"Got this assuming it contains everything needed but no, it doesn't. My toilet plumbing uses a much thinner tube so it was hard to use method 1. I had to opt for method 2 but still had to get a tube that was flexible enough to accommodate this outlet.

No heat modifications and the water just comes out like regular cold tap water. The only adjustments are the two different regions that you want to clean (back end or front end for women). And then you can keep turning the knob for higher pressure. Honestly, not the best high tech bidet on the market, it does the job but honestly, there could have been some better modifications to make it better.

The lid does slow close which is good i guess."
"I have a similar bidet seat in my guest bathroom. I had an older one in my master bath that just did not work as well as the one in my guest bathroom, so I decided to try the Moen Bidet Seat. Definitely like this bidet!

It was easy to install. I removed the old seat and removed the water line, then installed the new seat and screwed the water line in. Piece of cake. The water pressure dial works great. I keep it set on about the halfway mark.

When I installed the original seat, I put in a three-way cut-off valve so that I could cut off the water flow to the bidet if necessary. Partially because I don't trust my own plumbing work and did not want water leaking through the floor. But, partially so that I could turn it off if I was going to be out of the house for several days at a time.

This fit my oval shaped toilet just fine.

Also, during installation, make sure you use the plumbers tape so that you get a very good seal on both sides of the hose. that will reduce the possibility of a leak. There is no electric connections and no water heating. So, the water spraying on your backside is a wee bit chilly in the winter. But, as long as you are prepared for that, it is fine. (There are bidets that heat the water first. This is not one of them.)

On the whole, I'm very pleased with this Moen Bidet. I have other Moen fixtures in my house and find their quality to be excellent."
"We've had several powered bidet seats over the years. I've never tried a non-powdered seat. I have tried the full appliance type a few times but I prefer just the seat. I didn't expect to be wowed, I just wanted a non-powdered backup for when the power goes off (we live in the mtns so it's pretty common).

It comes nowhere near the pressure a powdered seat can bring but I think that should be expected.

It's easy enough to use, the dial is pretty simple and you do have some control over pressure.

The lid can be sat on. That's not usual for a powdered bidet.

It does have separate front and rear streams.

Lots of trouble getting this hooked up. We had to buy our own connector. Our house is 11yrs old so I wouldn't think it's an issue of old fittings. It continues to leak. It doesn't appear to be hose-related but we can't find where.

It also doesn't quite fit our fixture. I've had no trouble with regular seats or other bidet seats so that makes me feel like it's a design issue. With males in the house, that's not an option so we removed it.

It works fine for cleaning and I may have just gotten unlucky with the leak, but with the leak and the odd fit, I think 3 stars is generous.

"It is a manual bidet seat. It's not electric, so it isn't temperature controlled and doesn't come with a remote. We haven't installed it yet so I can't say how it works but it appears to have all the necessary parts. Moen is generally a good brand so I have no doubt we'll be pleased with it... until winter anyway. No temperature control means it'll be quite brisk on warm parts during a season when you most want warmer water. Still, I'll rate it 4 stars for effort."
"It only took a few minutes to install this, and it fit our toilet well. Operation is easy. There is only one knob, and you turn it one way to wash the butt and the other way to wash the front on a female. There is no heater in this, so using it can be quite refreshing. If a male uses the front setting, it is an excellent substitute for a cold shower. It does do its job and is reducing toilet paper consumption."
" Not sure which model I was sent, but most assuredly there was no temperature control, remote, or electronic component of any kind on the Moen Bidet seat I received. Nonetheless, this Moen Bidet seat is the greatest invention since rolled toilet paper, and I cannot stress enough how easy to install it was (about 10 minutes), or what a true pleasure it was to use. It really works great. Please watch the attached video I made for an in depth demonstration of the front and rear wash functionality, and ease of installation of this bidet seat. Everything needed is in the box including the stainless steel hose with filter screen on the seat end, the water diverter, and all the hardware for the seat, which is a snap on arrangement that mounts to a fixed plate attached to the toilet. The seat is easily removed by a button you push that releases the seat from the plate. This seat is also a soft close style, and is nice and roomy to accommodate today’s trendy larger posteriors. The Moen build quality is there, and there’s a three year guarantee. You really must try one of these Moen bidet seats for yourself. You will not regret it!"
"This was installed by my father, who prohibit me from installing anything for everyone's sake lol
It was easy for him to install this but everything seems to be easy for him, so not sure I can say that for everyone.
This one was installed to the toilet at our vacation site where I don't spend time all the time, so it wasn't used everyday (but used heavily over summer whenever I went up there lol)
It's been over 5 months, and it is still working fine the last time I checked.
This one is the most economical bidet I've ever gotten, so I didn't have that high of expectation on both quality and performance. So from such a perspective, this one didn't disappoint :)
If this one fails me unexpectedly, i will definitely update my review."
"This toilet seat was easy to install. Instructions were clear and easy to follow.
However the seat didn’t fit securely on our exsisting toilet and hung over the front a few inches.
The water line we had also did not fit into the seats connection so we had to order a new one in order to use the bidet feature.
Otherwise everything else was great! It’s truly a great seat with great features. Just make sure you check your connections before ordering."
"This is a nice bidet seat, but there's nothing electronic about it. This is cold water only."
"Play Video
 Update after 2 month use, it start leaking. I notice a water mark on the floor and found it start leaking.......(see video)

-----
The screw adaptor does not fit with my Kohler wellworth classis, glad that adaptor is made by plastic so i have peel it little by little to screw it in. After spending hours to make it work, the installation is easy, it came with all parts that you need. The bidet work ok but the seat is not as comfortable compare with my original Kohler toilet seat."
Installed in 20 min works great no leaks great price and keeps me clean.
"I've replaced my bidet every time I moved. I had 2 Blue Bidet 3000-A & a third 3000-B, also had a cheap Chinese Bidet in the last 14 yrs. They all had excellent water pressure & I thought that was the norm. Nope! The water pressure is awful, it is more like a limp trickle. I have 3/8 hose all the way to the sit. There's no blockage in the line & the house has perfect water pressure. I removed the hose to check the pressure & it's like a garden hose fully opened. It's the bidet, the bidet is designed to not let pressure through. It's awful for the $100+ price. This is my most expensive bidet & it's the worst. I do love the slow sit close & easy install. But the limp trickle water pressure ruins it."
I love this product except for the odor it omits. I thought it was coming from the toilet itself so replaced the toilet but still the same strange smell. I see the new one comes with a deodorizer and this may be part of the reason for this new upgrade to the product.
"The SmartBidet is a well designed and constructed product that easily interfaces to the toilet, replacing the existing seat. Its features a heated seat and heated water reservoir that is very much appreciated in colder environments, and with variable temperature settings, you can get all that just right to your liking. A position adjustable nozzle wand extends under your bottom when seated and the control activated. The nozzle can be in normal flush or in “turbo” mode that provides a more focus jet for those hard to get places. Addition fun can be had with the oscillation mode, which moves the wand back and forth a bit to cover extended areas in needed.

Functions and activation are made with a handheld IR controller. A handy mount allows for placing on a nearby surface for secure keeping. This makes usage of the bidet much easier than having to blindly reach down to the side of the unit to activate various functions. The IR beam seems to have a very reliable transmission to the bidet’s controller regardless as to where it is pointed in the room.

The seat and lid are dampened upon moving down so that they cannot slip and crash into the base. This has saved potential damage to these components many times. Having said this and now that I’m used to this design feature, I find that I may now forget that a standard toilet seat/lid may not have dampeners (that’s just me, maybe).

The installation connection to the cold water valve servicing the toilet is made easy with the provided hardware, but be mindful that if the separation distance is too far, you may need to find a longer hose. Also, this product does require AC power, so you’ll need an outlet in the room. For my room, I also needed a simple extension cord to reach the end of the provided cord and the wall outlet, which I affixed to the baseboard to make a clean installation.

After a couple of years of usage, my SmartBidet began to show functional irregularities where it would not activate. I’m not sure if it may have been impacted by numerous power failures/surges I had this winter, or perhaps the ‘skin sensor’ in the seat falling to detect, but upon reaching out to customer service, a replacement solution was agreed upon. They responded via email within an hour, so I have to say they are very responsive and supportive based on this experience.

Without reservation, I recommend this product for its solid design and construction, customizable features, and great customer support. As a bonus, my toilet paper usage has be reduced to a very minimal amount while actually improving hygiene."
">UPDATE<
Two and a half years later, moved to a new house (took the bidet with me) and still going strong. Still use it every time I go #2. Not a single issue, even after installing, uninstalling, moving, reinstalling. After the move, I really missed it for a couple of weeks while I was unpacking and didn't have time to reinstall it. Nothing like a squeeky clean pooper.
>END UPDATE, START ORIGINAL REVIEW<
I recently spent a week in Seoul, South Korea. My hotel room had a bidet. Being a born-and-bred American, and maybe a bit uncultured, I had always assumed that bidets were a thing for women, so even though it was there in my room I didn't use it for several days. I may not have even noticed it, but the ""flush"" button was on a panel with several other buttons, so I was forced to at least glance at it, if just to figure out how to flush. Eventually, with nothing else to read, I began to look at the other buttons on the bidet panel. Curiosity got the best of me, and I just had to know what happens when you push the button with the image of water spraying up towards what appeared to be a butt. Well, suffice it to say that the last half of my week in Korea I had the cleanest bum I have ever had.
So I get home (to Texas) and immediately start looking for a bidet. I was happy to find this one, with pretty much all the features of the fancy one in my Korean hotel room. I ordered it. It came one day late (day 3 of a 2 day delivery), but I won't knock the product for the shipping issue. It was a bit harder to install than I had hoped, because I live in a house that, while very nice, was built in the 80s and has the same toilets and plumbing that was here when it was built. I had to replace the entire valve behind the toilet and getting the bolts out to remove the old seat ultimately required bolt cutters (which I happened to have handy), but I got it done. The ""install"" was much easier than the ""uninstall"" of the old stuff, so again, not really a product issue. I also had to install a power outlet. Luckily I am handy and there was a receptacle right on the other side of the shared wall, so it wasn't too hard.
I got it hooked up and plugged in. No leaks, no fouls, no errors. Took me about 1.5 hours, and I'm pretty handy, but again, at least an hour or more of that was dealing with the existing stuff.
Okay, so I had a friend over, and I was a bit embarrassed to try it out with him standing there, so I waited until he left. Once I had some privacy, I did the requisite startup procedures (see the instructions) which took about 3-4 minutes (including tank filling and water and seat heat-up time). It was all automatic with the push of a button on the remote. No need to get my hands wet or carry funnels or pitchers of water around or anything.
Now for the moment of truth. I must say, there really is nothing to prepare you for that moment. I suggest you start with the normal ""back"" wash instead of the ""turbo"". I also suggest you set the water temp to low or medium for your first go.
Okay, press the button... wait for it... wait for it... WHOA... Wow.... wait... oh... hmmm... uhhhh... well.... okay... yeah... nice.... yeah... I could get used to this.
For the first day or so, I even sat down to pee, just so I could use the bidet. I NOW know that bidets are for women AND men. You have heard this in other reviews and I'll repeat it here. This is the civilized way to clean your bung-hole. I don't know how I could ever go back to the old wipe-and-check method. Maybe for camping or the pre-historic public bathrooms, but I see the bidet as an important part of hygiene just like brushing my teeth now.
FYI: The first two or three times I used it, the water spattered a little bit onto my junk. That seems to have stopped once it got broken in a bit.
Look, I consider myself to be a manly man, but not a Neanderthal. I no longer see any need to scrub my dookie-chute with a piece of paper, although you may want to do a little dab-drying before running the dryer, just to speed up the process. You can spare a square for that, but no need to get a softball sized wad and hope it goes down. You will use a LOT less TP. Maybe 90% less.
Now, as for the ""turbo"" setting, you may want to keep your finger on the ""stop"" button the first time you try it. It is not for the delicate skinned. It is probably just short of powerful enough to peel an apple. I'm not sure if it is related to the water pressure in your home. All of the wash functions have adjustable water pressure, but just be warned. That said, if you are worried that it won't be powerful enough to git-er-done, rest assured that unless you are eating lead paint this thing will give it a spit-shine.
The dryer works better than expected, but don't expect a leaf blower. Without a dabbing with the TP, you will be there for a while. The air is probably equal to a hair dryer on the lowest setting with medium heat, at best. That is not bad for a bidet, but don't expect what you would get from an air compressor at the tire shop.
The oscillate feature works as expected. I wonder if it would cause excessive wear-and-tear on the motor, but so far it works exactly as you would expect. The sprayer arm simply jigs in and out about 1/4 inch each way. It does not turn from side to side, so make sure your stance is centered before you commit to sitting down. Still, if you are off by a little bit, it is pretty easy to squirm around and get it on target. The nozzle is also adjustable using the remote (again, only forward and back, not side to side), so your typical landing should work with a little tweaking.
As for the remote, it worked for me no matter where I pointed it, including straight up, down, sideways, in the opposite direction of the detector, or whatever. Keep in mind that my toilet is in a separate small room just big enough for the toilet and the passenger with saloon-style doors, so your mileage may vary. I wound up mounting the remote holder just beside the toilet roll holder, which for me, works fine. I don't even need to take it out of the holder to use it.
The seat and water heat up very quickly. It claims it takes about 3 minutes. I use it on medium heat, and it is fine after about 45 seconds, which means, at least for me, even if I turned it on just as I am sitting down the water would be ready long before I am. If you turn the heated seat on after you have already sat down, you will notice the heat within less than 10 seconds. Probably some body-heat assist there, not sure.
The soft-close feature is good, but if it is up and you are in a hurry, it may increase the urgency while you wait for it to close so you can sit down. I personally never close the top lid, but it also has the soft close feature, so you never have to worry about the SLAM that you may get with typical toilet seats. One good thing about this setup is that my old toilet seat would not stay open unless I held it open (huge pain in the butt for men when standing) but this one does stay open on its own, so that was a bonus for me personally.
I also bought a ""glowbowl"" type light, which fits fine under this seat. It is a nice accessory ""add-on"" I recommend when you are buying this on Amazon. Just search for ""glowbowl"". The SmartBidet manufacturer should consider adding this feature since you already have the electricity right there. I assume the addition of a motion sensor might have other benefits as well, especially for energy saver mode.
Bottom line (no pun intended) this works at least as well as the fancy one in my hotel in Seoul, South Korea. If, as others have reported, it works for several years, this may be the best money I have ever spent... At least on a cost per-use basis. I am married, so my wife will probably use it more than me, and it is a sure thing that it will get used more than once per day at my house. That probably calculates out to less than .10 cents per use over its lifetime, more or less. The reduced cost of TP will probably counter the added electric and water bill, if I had to guess.
Last point... If you are looking at other ones that cost twice as much as this one (I paid $249) I can say with confidence that this one works just as advertised, just as I expected, and just as well as the ""heavy duty"" hotel-grade one that I used in Asia. I researched everything on Amazon and this is the one I got. I am thrilled with it. I will update with any new discoveries or problems."
"I did quite a bit of research before picking this one. It's a good value for the price. Works well, simple to install and use. Works great. You won't regret your purchase!"
"After touring Italy and a family member who installed a bidet, I joined the club. Completing as much research as I could muster factoring in affordability and function, I landed on this model. We are very pleased. The water temp, varied spray choices (bum to female) are well done. The fan is not so powerful, but, it's not a big deal to (a) use a bit of paper or (b) sit and enjoy the show for a bit longer. I often turn and flush first if I'm using the fan extensively. I love the slow close of the seat and lid. The remote works well.
My one complaint is the seat. It's sits comfortably, but it shifts a bit. That is, it clatters about when I'm beginning to sit. It's not tightening the seat to the toilet that is the issue, but seat joint itself between the seat and the lid.
I appreciate that I can turn the seat heat off at all times, or, if it's cold in the house, on a low/medium/high setting.
I installed it; a bit of challenge for me, but after numerous tries, plus several YouTube videos on its installation, I conquered all!
It's a great value and I'd buy it again."
"This is a perfect bidet that has worked well since installation. Warm seat, warm water, good power, the dryer is slightly wimpy, but if you allow it to do its job it dries just fine. The remote control is intuitive and easy to use. I am getting a second one for another bathroom, it's great value for money and very high quality. I highly recommend it."
"Stop your endless searching and comparing. Let me start by saying that I've had my eye on a bidet seat for well over a few years. I started building a house and thought to save all luxury expenses until after the home was built, which is what happened. I've been in my house for nearly a month and this seat was my latest luxury appointment added to my dream home. I know this is a big investment for most of you so I'll break it down as much as possible. Since there is always some kind of compromise when retrofitting something like an existing toilet, let's start with the good, then I'll talk about the bad, if you can call it bad. I will also address this brand versus others.

The Pros: It's simply human nature to follow in the footsteps of generations past. Most of us were raised knowing how to use a toilet and after simply wiping with a tissue. The more we wipe, the cleaner the tissue gets, but we all know it only really gets mostly clean. We accept that as good enough since it's simply how everyone does it. The pro part is that this product really works. I mean it REALLY cleans. When you lightly tab-dry your spot after cleaning, there is no trace of anything. Nothing. There is also this sense of satisfaction knowing that you're even cleaner than you used to be. That's also how I felt after moving from a regular toothbrush to a Sonicare years ago.

Before I mention the Cons, I'll say that the Pros outweigh the cons by miles.

The Cons: There is usually some compromise when you retrofit something. In this case, the seat is a fairly large statement sitting atop the toilet. It's wider and bulkier than a toilet seat and although you'd know that going in, once in place, I lost the beautiful lines of my expensive Toto toilet. Now, if I had to put a rating on the pro vs con, I would say 10 points to the pro and 3 for the con. Pro wins!

So yes, I'm completely willing to give up the clean lines of my toilet for this utility I don't want to live without now.

So let's now discuss features, price and how I ended up with this particular brand and model. If you're anything like me, you'll read a thousand reviews and compare and compare and compare till you feel you have your best answer. I did just that and thought for sure I was getting a Brondell swash 900 or 1000. It was a better value than Toto and the reviews were great. Only at the time I was ready to pull the trigger did I stumble on SmartBidet and starting comparing features. It came down to this: I didn't want to spend upwards of $500 for something that could fail in a few years, so I made a price limit for myself which was $300 and under. After reading a lot of reviews, I felt the features of this model were on par with others' which were more expensive and reviews seemed to back this product up. I'll admit, I've had this installed for about 48 hours, but I've run it through its paces and I would give up my Sonicare toothbrush before giving this up.

Operation: This seat has more things than I actually wanted, but more is better than less. I didn't need a heated seat or even heated water. I live in Southern California, so only time will tell if I ever use either function. On those few cold weeks, we have here in LA, I might revisit these functions. I've tested them, and they work, but I don't feel the need to heat anything. I prefer this remote version to the versions with the controls on the side of the seat, mostly for aesthetics and cleanliness. Also, there is a dryer function that works well, but as another reviewer also stated, you're stirring around a lot of air particles that you might want to leave alone. I will say, though, it does dry pretty well. You'll still need a light tap with toilet tissue. The functions I feel are great are Nozzle Position and Oscillate. Only on my second use did I discover the water pressure + and - function and WOW. The top pressure might take graffiti off a block wall. Okay, not that strong but it made you chuckle right? Variable pressure is a great option for sure.

******* 5-YEAR UPDATE*******
So, five years later it still performs like new. Also, I've only had to change the batteries in the remote once in all this time. Also, I have a tip if you're going to buy one:
Click the Energy Saver button on the remote so the unit has (2) red LED lights on. One for power, the other for Energy Saver. It will stay in this mode, just verify now and then by looking for both LEDs to be lit up. The reason you want this is so the heating element for the water sprayer only goes on after you sit on the seat. Otherwise, it will be warming the seat 24/7 and since it uses conductive heating, that can cost you on the electric bill. Besides, it starts to warm the water once you sit and only takes about 60 seconds. You need that time to do your business anyway, usually. It might also warm the toilet seat, but let's get real. It's plastic. However cold your home might be, a plastic seat warms with your body in about 5 seconds or less anyway.

***********UPDATE**********
Just after the 5-year mark, it started blowing outlet circuit breakers. I thought it was the outlet and changed it. The unit will always work initially, but when I return to the toilet, the breaker the GFI circuit it tripped. I'm now going to consider a new one. I'm not sure if I'll get the same version again or a different one. for 5 years, it worked great until it failed."
"Growing up in the US, my bathroom hygiene consisted of toilet paper and wet wipes (like any other good American). While this was serviceable, the alcohol in the wipes would often cause irritation with heavy use. I figured that was as good as it was going to get. After the Coronavirus hit, both wet wipes and toilet paper were in short supply and much more expensive than before. Adding to that the environmental impacts of wet wipes on city sewer systems (seriously search on youtube Fatbergs The Guardian), and it became clear pretty quick that I needed to make a change.
With a flood of bidet ads all over youtube and TV, I didn't know which to choose. I knew I didn't want freezing cold water on my bottom, but my toilet was in an alcove far away from a sink. That meant an electric bidet with an extension cord. I also wanted one with a dryer. Comparable units at that price point cost $330+ and didn't come with a remote control to easily see what button was being pressed (again toilet is in an alcove so a control rod by the bidet wouldn't fit easily). Thankfully on one of those review sites someone mentioned smart bidet. I pulled the trigger on this unit and boy am I so glad I did!
Installation went smoothly! All parts needed were included (except for wrenches). They even had a braided steel toilet supply line in the box, which I ended up needing to replace the cheap PVC one that was on my existing toilet. If a 30 y/o female with no previous plumbing experience could do it, you can too! Hint: watch youtube for installation video.
Now to the part you care about: how does it work? Amazingly! I can't believe these aren't standard in all toilets across America. The water pressure is awesome!! It cleans well, heats nicely and I haven't had to use any toilet paper or wet wipes since it was installed weeks ago. For a girl with autoimmune disease this has been a godsend! The only negatives that I can say is that the dryer isn't super powerful (not a dealbreaker) and that the hot water does run out for the last 10 seconds or so of the cycle (but the water is still room temp not cold). Buy one (trust me), you'll be glad you did and wondering where these were all your life!"
"I bought this unit to replace an existing model that's almost exactly the same. I bought the original model at a warehouse store (over 10 years ago). My original model had two main problems -
1) the remote control unit didn't work perfectly all the time. I contacted customer service, and they shipped me a replacement without hassle.
2) over time the seat and lid started to crack. Now, there's a warning that comes with the unit indicating not to use harsh chemicals - I suspect that my problems were as a result of ignoring this.

So it's to be noted that over the time of me owning my prior unit, there were never any problems with the fluidics.

The instructions are a little clumsy, and don't concentrate on a few key points, such as how to align the base plate. I suggest laying the base plate (the light yellow coloured plastic part with the arrows) on the cleaned seat-free toilet bowl with the anchor screws in place, then, while holding the screws in place, snapping the base plate into the bidet unit... then putting the entire unit on the toilet bowl with screws in place, aligning, then fastening the screws.

This unit comes with all of the plumbing hardware that's needed - the T-join for splitting the toilet tank intake water from the bidet intake water, and a pipe screw adapter if the incoming pipe is too big. It also has the two hoses - one for the toilet tank, and one for the bidet.

The unit has spray functions for men and women, the ability to change nozzle position, change the temperature of the water, oscillation, a dryer, and an eco-saver (which doesn't pre-heat the water). My existing remote still works with the new unit, although some of the labels have been renamed.

I'm really happy with my replacement unit, and expect at least another 10 years out of it, while knowing that customer service will help me if something goes wrong."
"I admit I was skeptical, bemused and cautiously optimistic about buying and installing a SmartBidet in our master bathroom. This product is awesome and transformative of the usual and customary trips to the toilet. It does take some getting-used-to; the water takes some time to warm. My first experience - with room temperature water - was rather alarming to the senses. But take your time, let the reservoir water warm up and really enjoy the go. Press a few buttons, including air dry, and your posterior is safely, gently and thoroughly cleaned; almost miraculously so. Highly - and lowly - recommended purchase."
"We have had this bidet for over 3 years so far. Zero problems, great features and I wouldn't hesitate to get another. We have tried 3 different bidets, and we love this one the best! Why spend more if you have a great product for less $ than others cost?
*We DID purchase a cheaper one for the spare bathroom recently, and although it IS good, we just can't put our finger on why we love this one so much! (better) 🤷‍♀️"
"I finally decided to pull the trigger on upgrading my lifestyle with a nice bidet, and I'm not disappointed! It was fairly easy to install, despite the convoluted Quick Start Instructions that were included. Once I read the user's manual and sorted out the problem, it went smoothly.

The heated seat is real nice and have a few temperature settings for comfort. The heated water is nice too, but it doesn't last as long (30 seconds) with higher nozzle pressure. Usually I'd be almost done washing by the end of the hot water. I'm very happy with the nozzle options, and pressure! It has a regular, oscillating, turbo, and female wash. There are several water pressure, and nozzle position options. I use them frequently for maximum cleanliness throughout my bottom region.

I probably won't rebuy this particular model, but spend a bit more for an unlimited hot water model. The models with a nightlight, and odor eliminator options weren't a priority for me. Overall, not a bad buy for a first-timer."
"water temperature & pressure are low at highest level are very low. Power cord is only 43 inches and you will add a cord extension if power plug is in right side of the toilet. If it is 60 inches(5 Foot), it will be much better.

Anyway it is better than nothing."
This is the third one I have purchased - the other two were considerably more expensive but this works equally as well as the more expensive brands.
For the bidet
"The old one didn't control the heat sensors anymore.
New one replaced the old one seamlessly."
Needed a new remote for the bidet and product showed up as described and worked right out of the package. Will buy again when needed for sure.

SmartBidet SB-1000 Electric Bidet Seat Review

SmartBidet SB-1000 bidet toilet seat is a Japanese toilet distributed by Hitrons Solutions in North America. Hitron Solutions is a company that specializes in distributing small business products from Asia in America. The SmartBidet SB-1000 is a toilet seat that is packed with different features and priced at $ 249.99 on Amazon.
The SB-1000 design is clean but simple and comes in white. It’s back is 7 inches making it taller than most toilet seat designs making it seem clunky at the back. The SB-1000 is also remote-controlled. Its remote has different buttons to change both the water and seat temperatures, the pressure of the water, the position of the nozzle, ending the washes, the Posterior button, the Feminine button, and the Turbo button (Amazon.Com). The remote also has a drying, oscillation, and energy saving button. The remote uses 2AAA batteries. The elongated toilet seat dimensions are 20.7 inches long, 17.3 inches wide, and 7.13 inches at the back’s highest point, which can be used on all toilets apart from a French curve toilet.
The SmartBidet SB-1000 has many features: a nozzle that self-cleans, oscillated washes, and can be switched over to energy saving mode. Its wash settings have three cleansing buttons, which are Turbo, Feminine, and Posterior (Amazon.Com). The Turbo cleansing button is a backwash for a female, the Feminine button is for a female’s front wash, and the posterior button is for a male backwash. The oscillate button used can be combined with the three other buttons for the nozzle to move back and forth, thus creating a more extensive wash.
The SB-1000 is also customizable as the nozzle position can be adjusted to 5 different levels, the seat for four different temperatures, the water temperature to 4 different levels, the water levels for five different levels, and the dryer for five different levels.
The SB-1000 comes with a customizable toilet seat with warm water, air dryer, and customizable cleaning. It is also remote controlled. The Energy-saving mode saves energy by lowering the seat and water temperature (Amazon.Com). Overall, it is a simple and very applicable. The SmartBidet SB-100 price is fair as it has a lot of features, and similar products have very high rates.
The major drawback of the SmartBidet SB-1000 is that it has a system and a tank. The tank started to leak a little I think but it’s not really worth taking it apart. The system heats water using a coil, and the second system heats and stores water in a tank and keeps it warm up to the amount it can handle. When the warm water runs out, the toilet seat's user has to wait for it to fill with warm water. The toilet seat is bulky because of the water tank it comes with.
The SmartBidet SB-1000 is an excellent product with features that can be found in more advanced bidets. It can be found on Amazon. In case one doesn't have a problem with a clunkier bidet, its functions that is: it can be controlled by a remote, has wash settings that are customized, energy saving, and has a nozzle that can clean itself for a great prize of $249.99. I absolutely love this product, it makes cold winter midnight restroom trips much more enjoyable with the heated seat feature.

"I purchased the SB1000 E/W in 2018 and have been more than happy with its features and performance...that is until recently. The seat and seat lid have a soft close feature that worked fine until the other day when I pulled the lid forward and it slammed closed. When I took a look I could see that the plastic around the ""soft close"" was cracked and broken in at least 3 places. Under closer examination I spotted areas that had blobs of dried up glue, so obviously this had broken previously and someone tried to fix it....and returned it. BUT the real interesting thing is that in 2022 I recommended this bidet to a relative and when they went to install it they found the soft close lid didn't work. Checked it out and the plastic around the hinge was cracked. they returned it and ordered a replacement which worked fine. Obviously this has been a flaw in the design that may or may not have been addressed. I went online to order a new lid and they are out of stock..HMMM?"
"The seat and bidet are great. The sensor on the seat is a nice feature but you need to be aware of your legs. If they're spread too wide, they won't contact the sensor and the bidet will not function. The lid is not a great design either. Since it has an edge, you can't really lean back on it without it digging into your back. You can put a pillow back there, just be mindful of the pillow when you stand up."
"This works on SB-100R also.

The remote control came with the bidet breaks in 2.5 years just do not make sense."
"Getting a bidet is definitely an upgrade for your bathroom routine. This one works as advertised. Installation instructions were clear and well-detailed. Feels sturdy, and I'm a big dude.

A nice surprise is how quickly it heats the water. No need to always have it 'running'. I just use the remote to go from Off to Hot, and within 3 minutes or so the water is nice and warm. Then I shut it off til next use.

There are good positional adjustments for the spray. And I've found no need to explore spray power above the middle setting, and no way am I hitting that Turbo button!

The Dryer works ok, nice warm air, however I've found you'll likely still be a bit damp and want to handle that, so you won't be going totally paperless, but very close. I'm happy with my purchase and would buy again."
"Love this!! Having a warm seat is money! Although, it seems as though it has caused some intestinal issues, as the wife has to constantly use the restroom for a LONG time."
"I bought the elongated one April 2022. It started leaking, a lot, last week. We tried to fix it but we gave up today and trashed it. The other issue, which was minor, was the water never reached towards the front of the bowl. The user had to sit in exactly the right spot for cleaning the posterior otherwise it would hit above the intended area and splash back all over the lid while the feminine setting was just a weaker version of the regular setting. But the big disappointment is the massive leak it sprung. I would expect a $250 bidet to last a lot longer than this did."
"Every home in America needs one of these. For the life of me, I can't understand why we don't have these or something similar to be clean.

I had a bidet attachment on my toilet prior to this and I think I may have gotten one that wasn't designed for round toilets so it would constantly need tightening to get it in the right position.

It also wasn't electric so I could only get cold water out of it.

I decided to splurge on this smart bidet because of the features. Heated seat, dryer, warm water, oscillating... I mean, it's a huge upgrade from what I had.

I can say this, I WISH I would have discovered this sooner. I have a standard round toilet and this smart bidet fits my toilet perfectly. It came with an anchor too so it doesn't move around when sitting on it.

You kinda don't know that you're missing out on warm water until you experience this thing. Same with the oscillating feature. And the heated seat. It's a lot more comfortable and I feel cleaner than I did from the warm water compared to my old bidet attachment.

Now there are a few cons.

First is, I'm a woman with a larger butt. The seat is pretty small to where I have to sit with my back kinda pressed against the back of the bidet attachment so that I can get the nozzle in the right position.

Also, I can't fully get to the front without moving my body around, even after adjusting the position of the nozzle using the remote. It comes close but not quite there.

It's big. Not the most dainty looking seat for your toilet but I can live with it considering all of the features it has.

And lastly, the dryer. Although it will run for three minutes, it doesn't get you dry. It's also off to the left so you feel it more on that side.

So you'll still need butt towels or toilet paper to get fully dry. Still not a huge deal.

Overall the cons are super small in comparison to all the benefits you get and at this point, I can't imagine not having this at home moving forward.

It will be interesting having company over and explaining how to use it. And hearing their take on it. But for myself and my teenager, it's already perfect."
"It feels strange calling a $300 toilet seat ""mid range"" but let's face it... there are $600, $700, and $1000+ models out there, and there are $50 models out there. This baby is mid range. For the price, I'm more than satisfied with its performance.

With TP nearly impossible to buy and our supply we purchased before all the hoarding and supply chain breakdown dwindling, I thought it was time to upgrade our existing cold water only $50 bidet attachment. Yep - we already had something, but I'm the only one who would use it, having been forced to become familiar and comfortable with it while recovering from an injury. I'll let your imagination fill in the blanks. Back to the subject at hand.

The water gets plenty warm, and is adjustable. The pressure is great, and adjustable. My wife reports that the feminine cleaning function performs adequately. So far I am the only one to sample the turbo function. It seems like the stream is narrowed in order to provide more pressure. I find the ordinary wash function with the pressure maxed out far more comfortable, but if you feel like you need a pressure washer back there I guess it's nice to have it. I would like if the turbo stream didn't have to be narrowed so much to accomplish its task though.

The warm air dryer is somewhat like the little tugboat that could. It does get the job done. It takes a while to get there. But let me tell you, as someone who had to use a cold water followed by a drip dry for some time, this warm air dryer CAN eliminate the need for TP if you just take a little more time with it. Let's put it this way - the wash functions run for 1 minute at a time, but the dryer will run for a full 3 minutes. There's a reason for that! I do think the warm air dryer would be a lot better if it was angled to come in at a similar attitude to the wash nozzle, or heck, even adjustable using the remote the way you can adjust the wash nozzle angle...

Anyway, pulling off half a star each for the slow and non-angle-adjustable air dryer, and for the narrow stream on the turbo function which makes it pretty uncomfortable to use. Mind you, I'll still use both these functions as needed (the turbo much less so) but they could be improved.

Installation was very simple. If you've ever done a little handyman level plumbing you can do this easily. They include everything you need for a typical installation, except the tools. You'll need a 16mm & 17mm wrench, or an adjustable - other than that, everything's in the box, including a new compression fitting hose for your toilet tank supply."
Works great !!!!
"I had never used a bidet before but was going to have a surgery that would make clean up challenging during recovery. We installed this before so I could get used to it, thinking I would need time to get used to it.

Didn’t need an adjustment period at all. This thing is fantastic and I can’t believe I never thought of trying a bidet before this. It gets you SO much cleaner!

The remote is great. It has different levels of heat for the seat and the water temperature. They pretty much thought of everything. You can easily adjust everything through the remote with several different settings. Posterior, feminine, even turbo. It even has a dryer.

I would recommend this to every single human being on earth. But beware….once you use this you will never want to return to your old school bathroom routine. Lol

Honestly I would give it 10 stars if I could. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"
"I had this toilet seat for years in a house that I put on the market. I decided to leave it due to the plumbing already set up. So I thought I'd buy a more expensive updated toilet seat for my new home. It was pretty, and lit up inside, but wow did I miss that turbo feature. In my research I found there are really only two that have that good turbo. So while I tried to accept the new one, I finally could not take it anymore and was happy that I could even still buy the older version. I recently had major surgery after a pelvic floor prolapse. I need to be very careful and not push BM. This seat is my savior."
"Bought this at start of covid in 2020 and it's going strong 3.5 years later: zero maintenance, no finickiness, no leaks. It just works! Not even sure if we've replaced the remote control's battery.

It has good settings for adjustment of angles and suits everyone who has tried it. Highly recommend. It's pricey compared to some cheap ones, but I have dealt with those and they are awful... so awful at my partner's house I gave up on them and am about to purchase this one again."
"Got this model b/c it was randomly cheaper on Amazon than the store website at the time - was not disappointed.
No more cold butt in the morning or late at night, even with the energy saving options turned on.
Sometimes I find the water can be a bit too warm or strong coming out, but the remote makes that easy to change and adjust as needed for whatever mood your underside is in that day.

Every home should own these at this point... treat yourself to some comfort!"
"This is my third one of these particular units and they are great. Don't turn the seat heat up too high, your best to use Eco setting all the time...and keep the seat down. Make sure you don't use chemicals to clean the seat. Having it on high heat with the seat up is going to make the seat work extra hard to get hot and it discolors the plastic. Also, there's a sticker on the inside of the lid that's quite ugly but if you take it off the warranty is void. So make sure you leave it on.

The product is good with these caveats."
"I am 76 years old, and I found this product very easy to install. You do have to lay on the floor for the hose hook ups, but it is all very straightforward. All it takes is a socket wrench and a few other little tools. The directions are good and I had it working like a charm within 30 minutes. Try all of the settings on the remote before you settle on your favorites. I accidentally used the turbo setting in the middle of the night when it was dark, and I could not see the controller perfectly. I would not advise this ladies; It is one of those episodic memories that will last forever.

Reader should be aware that you cannot use regular cleaning products on the plastic. I mixed up a little bottle of vinegar and baking soda, and that is what I use. It’s slightly annoying, but better than ruining the seat. Everything works great on this product So far. You should be aware that it takes less than a minute for the seat and the water reservoir to heat up. So if you’re in and out, don’t expect a warm stream of water or a heated seat. So hang out for about 30 seconds and you will have the experience you’ve been expecting. This is an excellent product and I would highly recommend buying it again."
"I bought the SB-1000 WE 6 months ago. I really love the product BUT BUYER BEWARE! The air dryer stopped working. I called the company, they admitted there were problems with the air dryers on these models. They told me they would replace the entire unit free of charge. A few days later I received an email saying they were requesting the serial number on my unit. A reasonable request. HOWEVER, the serial number, they told me was on a sticker inside lid area. When we received the unit, my late wife didn’t like all the stickers all over the unit which she not only felt they were an eye sore but unsanitary when cleaning. Most companies emboss the serial numbers or put the sticker inside or under the unit, not at a eye sore area. I called the company again and explained this and produced the receipt and was told my only recourse was to BUY the main body part at a cost of over $100. They gave me a 20% discount but the final cost is still close to $100 for a defective part. Half the almost half the cost of a new unit. This company does not stand behind their products. BUYER BEWARE."
"I've read other online reviews by customers who said they installed their SB-1000 SmartBidet in 25 minutes. In what alternative reality universe can anyone (other than for a professional plumber) install an electric bidet so quickly? It took me 25 minutes just to read the provided User Manual and the Installation Guide instructions and to find and watch some helpful How-To installation videos that are available on the Internet for the SmartBidet Model SB-1000.

I am not a handyperson. I was worried I might damage my bathroom's water pipes or plumbing shutoff-valves and end-up with a flooded mess in my bathroom. Additionally, this SmartBidet is mostly made of plastic. I was concerned about cracking or over-tightening or stripping-out the plastic parts--especially the cheap plastic water connection to the SmartBidet warm water reservoir.

I ended-up taking the product installation very slowly, carefully, and gently. Finally, two (2) nervous hours later, the installation was done successfully. (Whew!)

Now that the work of the installation is done, I am enjoying this SmartBidet. All the functions seem to be as advertised, except for the nozzle cleaning functionality listed on Page 18 of the User Manual (see Section 10: Maintenance). In the Section 10 subsection entitled, ""Cleaning the Nozzle,"" it says: ""...without sitting on the toilet seat, use the Remote Controller and press and hold the STOP button for three (3) seconds and the water nozzle will extend"" for easy cleaning.

Nope.

After several attempts, I could not get the nozzle to extend itself. I even tried unplugging the bidet and restarting/rebooting it, but I still had no luck with this maintenance feature. However, the rest of the functionality seems to check out just fine with my unit. Although I have had my SmartBidet for less than a day so far, I think I will be very happy with all of its full-featured offerings. My unit has all the bells-and-whistles I could possibly want. I would recommend this model to a friend as a good value at $250. I just hope my unit will last me a long time, given its flimsy plastic construction. I guess I will just have to be gentle when using it."
 I've been using the Biobidets for years. My first was the BB-2000. I had it for 8 years and it was great but it was time for a new one soni bought the BB -1000 which is more stream lined and updated. It works great. I have installed all of my bidet seats and never needed to call CS for anything.
"Thus far, I cannot praise this product enough. It delivers everything that was promised. Perhaps most surprising of all, it was relatively easy to install, but I do suggest watching one of the videos on YouTube that walk a person through the process. Also, as to the installation directions, pay attention on how to release the seat attachment array in case it's locked in place ""prematurely"" (which I managed to accomplish and had to spend considerable time deciphering the photo, as the picture detailing the release was confusing).

Regarding the function of the bidet seat, the water is warm and a comfortable spray thoroughly cleanses the entire area. This is an enormous help to an older person such as myself who might suffer from limited range of motion. I realize that this comment would apply to any bidet product, but since I'm reviewing this item specifically, I’m addressing my satisfaction with this unit.

I'm going to give the seat six months or so to see how it holds up, and if it continues to work as designed I'll be purchasing another unit from SmartBidet for our other bathroom (I weigh 250 pounds, so I want to be certain it will continue to handle my weight)."
"Let me first say that this review will be slightly grafic. Not in a bad way but I feel I have to give details. I am 63 years old. I have been using bidets for about 12 or 13 years. I started using bidets because I suffer from hemorrhoids and it has been the best method I found to clean myself after going number two. Before I discovered bidets, 12 or 13 years ago, I suffered every time I had to wipe with to. I would be so raw that I would constantly bleed when wiping after number two. I tried preparation H and different wipes to no avail. Once I started using a bidet, my life became a lot more comfortable however, I was using portable bidets that you could control the stream strength. The problem was when I traveled, I had to take a bidet and install it in the hotel I was staying in. I did manage to find portable didets that didn't require installing but were manual. I just moved into a new home and decided to purchase this SmartBidet and, let me tell you, it was well worth the price. I have been using this bidet for about a week or so and it has been wonderful. The first time I used it, I thought I had made a mistake because I didn't thing the stream strength was what I was used to with my manual bidets however, I was pleasantly surprised after I padded my bottom with some TP and found, no residue left behind. The tempature of the water was so great. The oscillation feature was wonderful. The airstream for drying was very good but I would always pat myself with TP just to ensure there was no residual left behind. I am so happy with this bidet that I felt compelled to write this review voluntarily. I highly recommend this bidet to everyone and I want to say that it is WELL WORTH THE PRICE. I hope your experience is as good as mine. Great product."
"For those out there that have never used a bidet, you should try it and make sure it's something you prefer over traditional toilet paper. We all go, so let's be honest. If you have to go ""often"" sometimes, you can get raw down there. This would help with that. So.....about this particular model: I've used bidet's in fancy hotels and resorts, and this one works just as well if not better than some. Installation was pretty easy, but the instructions are not the best. If you're not sure about something, maybe you should look for a video on it. We had just bought a new toilet and wanted to go ahead and upgrade to the bidet feature. Toilets with those built in are too expensive. So we got a good quality American Standard toilet. Luckily for us, there was a wall beside the toilet and an outlet on the other side. An electrician friend installed another outlet easily (see last pic). The seller says to measure your holes to make sure this fits. I did not do that but was hoping with a new toilet it would be a standard width for the holes and sure enough this fit on there perfectly. If you have an older toilet, you may want to measure to be sure. The bracket that holds the bolts and attaches to the bottom of the seat, was the part of the instructions that are not perfectly clear. But after looking closely at it, you'll figure it out. Attaching the hoses was super easy. Just use the Y adapter, your existing water line and the new one that comes with this. This bidet has a water reservoir that keeps warm water ready for use. So if you are cleaning yourself for too long, you'll definitely feel the water turn cold. The remote control is really cool. You can set up the temperature on the water and the dryer. And you can even set the seat temperature. It's great to sit down on the seat and it's already a little warm. Overall, this is well worth the money. You can get cheaper ones, but not sure if you can find one that has the heated water, dryer and seat."
Significantly decrease on the toilet paper and clogs ... just get this thing.
"I read many reviews on many models and was considering the Toto most expensive model and found for the money I did not need the extra things it did verses this model for 1/4 the price. It works perfect just installed it last night took me about 20 min everything needed was included including the 3/8 tee needed on the water line. I have a jacuzzi that sits right next to my toilet with the access panel there so I was able to get a ground fault outlet that shares the jacuzzi with no extension. As far as the unit it works flawlessly. Water is plenty warm enough and seat too pressure is perfect and super strong on the turbo mode, you may have to sit all the way back on the seat to get it in the perfect spot with the wand extended all the way forward, but wasn't an issue. Drier works great and in the hottest setting is actually too hot so again there's plenty of adjustments for all to be satisfied. My two things I'm not so happy about is one the lid is very flimsy plastic that you can not sit on it will crack or break but I did know this before buying it as to other reviews. But really should be made better. My wife likes to sit on the closed toilet when she's blow drying her hair since it's by the sink now she can't do that anymore unless she sits on the toilet seat itself, not so bad since it's heated. My other Issue is that the color of the plastic lid does not match the actual unit and toilet seat. I ordered the oblong white. The seat matches the porcelain White of my toilet perfect but the lid is a pure bright white and is not the same match as the porcelain white of the toilet or the seat on this unit, kind of stands out but isn't much of an issue since it's in our master bath and only I and my wife see it, but if I had this in a guest bathroom it wouldn't look right. And only because the top flimsy lid does not match the color white of the rest. I'm not sure why the company's quality control did not see or notice this when manufacturing? Hmm. Overall I still gave this a 5 star review because the unit itself seems to be made of quality, and really works perfect. The actual toilet seat is very well made as to a very high quality seat you would by at a do it your self store. Note Add on bidets are a bit bulky on to of your toilet but that's to be expected since you have a tank and moving parts stored on the back also both the seat and lid is a soft closing type and work well."
"One year after I bought this bidet the remote died. I contacted the company and they sent me a new one. Great. Except a year later the new remote died. I'm like what's happening here. I contact customer service, they say they are sending me a new one. I wait and wait. I call them back and she tells me I'm out of warranty I have to go to their online store and order a new remote. $30 for a remote. I hope this one doesn't die. The bidet is great, the remote not so much and I wasn't thrilled with customer service."
We love it and highly suggest getting yourself one! So great even our 4 year old loves using it!
Was easy to install and works very well. Warm toilet seat is soooo nice
love bidet
"Love this bidet, the seat is nice and warm at all times, the features work well and are comfortable. This bidet was one of the best purchase I have made!"
"Things I love :

Heated seat
Heated water
Oscillation
Sturdiness
Quiet close

Things I'm not thrilled about:

Fairly short power cord. I don't know about all of you, but my toilet is close to my tub and for obvious reasons there's no power outlet near the tub or behind the toilet. They don't give you a lot of cord to work with. I ended up purchasing an outdoor extension cord and I drilled some holes in my vanity so that I could run the cord through the inside of the cabinet and out through the front right next to the toilet. This required a lot of work and electrical knowledge.

Dryer is about useless. The air direction is not adjustable. The dryer is set to the left (as you're sitting on the toilet) and basically blows straight forward. It does a great job of warming your left butt cheek. If you want it to blow where you need it then you have to physically turn your body to the right about 25 degrees. Even then, after the dryer has run for the max 3 minutes (you can press the button again and run it a second cycle) at max settings there's still a little bit of moisture left. It's not enough to be a problem and I know some people who use bidets just drip dry for a minute or so and move on but I like to be dry so I find I'm still using a small amount of T.P. to get rid of that residual moisture. Not something I expected to have to do after having a dryer blowing on me for 3 minutes.

Still giving a five star review because I'm in love with 95% of the features and I don't mind a little bit of T.P. use or using a personal towelette / washrag to dry myself."
"I have always wanted one of these but thought they were too expensive/difficult to install.
I read a ton of reviews for many, many bidet toilet seats, in multiple price ranges, which were very helpful and gave me good guidance.
The great news:
I have to say this is one of the BEST splurge purchases I have ever made. This one has almost all of the bells and whistles the way more expensive ones. The only thing missing is the deodorizer, which honestly seems ridiculous if you have a functioning fan/vent in your bathroom.
It is very responsive as far as changing the settings for temperature and position.
Some people complained about the placement of the dryer but I have to say I don't see it as an issue at all. Perhaps they have improved it since some of those reviews were written.
This model has the remote which I personally find much more appealing that twisting like a pretzel to reach the controls on the side. It comes with a holder and in my household there's no danger of someone walking off with it or misplacing it.
It is not particularly attractive but since my toilet is in a separate enclosure it doesn't bother me at all.
Now for the important and semi-bad news. I have an American Standard Cadet toilet with an enclosed trapway.
I searched high and low trying to figure out if it was even possible to install this because of the inaccessibility of the seat bolts. I hope this will help others who have the same question.
Answer:: it IS possible, but with much determination. The only way to reach the toilet seat bolts is to remove the tank. I was bound and determined to have this installed to the point that I was willing to buy a new toilet with a regular trapway to get it done.
Luckily it didn't come to that but it was touch and go.
The SmartBidet is the best of all worlds as far as function, cost and ease of use. Buy it."
"My family LOVES our bidets and we have purchase many of them. Unfortunately when they stop working after a few years, there is a big hunk of plastic and wiring that end up in the landfill. I just emailed the company to try and find out if they can be mailed back and some parts used again by them, or repaired and returned to me. The days of chucking things into the landfill are over and I hope the company works towards reducing this waste.

We were able to buy replacement parts for about half the price of a new bidet, but just wish they were more reliable. We have 2 bidets, and each has needed repair after about 2 years."
"I bought this for my dad, he loves it, he has had a couple strokes so it is harder for him in the bathroom, this has made things so much easier for him. He is always going on about how much he loves it. I personally haven't tried it. My husband has and said he really likes it. I installed it in about 20 minutes, it was super easy to do."
"Update: I'm increase to 4 stars. Receive a replacement, does not leak and work like it should. The product is a little bit rocky when you touch it, but does not move when you sit on it. I would recommend this product, just ensure you check for leaks. I actively monitored for two weeks. Now I'll passively monitor.

I'm giving this product a 3 because it has a very slow leak at the L joint that connects the water to the unit. The leak isn't where the hose connects, but at the swivel point (see photo). Aside from that the unit seems to work as intended.

Installation. very easy, no problems at all. When installing use both the installation guide in the main manual and the quick guide. You will get a better overall picture.

Seat it warm. (I don't like the fact it is alway warm-seems like a waste of energy), but not complaining.

Warm water and good spray pressure (doesn't seem to clean well, I still have to use wipes, ""BUT"" I think it gets better as you learn how to properly use the system).

Air dryer. Very good, 2 is ideal, at 3 seem to burn the butt.

Oscillation: very good

Nozzle position. To be honest I can't tell the difference and you have to be seated on the system for it to work..

Overall, I believe this is a very good product (once I get my replacement I will probably up ratings) but like anything else. your going to have some bad ones. I was really hoping I wouldn't get one."
It does it all wash warm dries with a remote
"Update: changed remote battery and it is working fine. I guess the batteries I put in earlier were not fresh.
3 stars for lasting 3 years. It was always temperamental, changing seat and water temperature on its own. Right at 3 years, the remote (w/ fresh batteries) would not shut off the water jet. Unplugging and re-plugging seemed to reset it and it will work for a few times, but then bad behavior starts again after a few days.
I will update after I deal with customer service."
"This is the second electric bidet I have purchased. The first unit was manufactured by the Bio Life Technology Company located in Southern Korea. This was an excellent unit, offered good value for the price, and worked flawlessly until it was damaged by an electrical storm this summer. Apparently Bio-Life is now out of business and replacement parts are no longer available. The six year performance of this unit will be the baseline for this review. The SB-1000 appears to have been manufactured (designed ?) in Asia.

At the advertising level, the SB-1000 has the same features as the Bio Life Tech model, however it's actual performance and value of the former is 50% of the latter.

Reading from the respective manufacture's labels, the Bio-Life Tech is rated at 1270 watts, the SB-1000 is rated at 660 watts. First glance gives the impression that the SB-1000 is more efficient , possibly offering lower operating cost. While operating cost is indeed lower, so is performance. The reason for the lower energy figure is that the SB-1000 has half the heating capacity in its fresh water heater and heated seat circuits. The consumer becomes acutely aware of this reduced heating capacity once he takes a shot of ""cold"" water from the water dispenser, especially during the colder months. Taking a rest on the heated seat is like sitting on a cold aluminum picnic table in the dead of winter at midnight. Neither of these function reach temperatures commensurate with an enjoyable experience. Minus two stars off for this condition.

Two reasons for the poorer performance: First is lower capacity offered by the respective heating elements used in the SB-1000 unit, lower wattage results in lower temperature for a given surface area. Secondly is the method which these resources are controlled. The Bio-Tech unit holds water until it heated to the selected temperature, which was achieved in near real time due to its higher heating capacity. In addition the Bio-Tech unit purges residual water in it's post heater plumbing, in much the same manner as premium air conditioning systems used in the automotive markets purge stale air before delivering properly conditioned air to the passenger compartment. As far as the SB-1000 heated seat, it heating element is simply inadequate for the function.

From a mechanical perspective, the SB-1000 falls short of the Bio-Tech model. The SB-1000 has been installed for two weeks and the seat surface in the area of the ""skin sensor"" has a 1"" crack in it already. In addition to this being irritatingly noticeable to the occupant, it presents a potential safety hazard to the occupant should water make it way
down into the 120VAC electric heating element area. In addition, the general fit of the hinged lid and seat to the base is undesirable as it leaves an impression that the these constructs will soon fail. One star off for this condition.

The SB-1000 remote control works well, however the aperture and intensity of the light emitting diodes is such that the eye becomes saturated with the emitted light to the point printed legends on the remote are unreadable. This situation is the same of driving late at night with tan approaching driver's lights on high beam. This condition can be corrected by reducing the level of LED current. While irritating to the eye, no points off the rating.

There is one common denominator to the above list of issue and that being the difference between Asian and Western cultures. While China is making remarkable gains in its technology and manufactures disciplines, it is still at the front of it's Industrial Revolution. Secondly China place high value of designing and manufacturing product at minimum cost, where Western culture sets it's base line on Quality. The latter only begins to take priority with maturation of the culture.

China's position of quality today is the direct result of their origin, that being the farm, the same as their Western counterparts of decades prior. Both came from an existence where they only had minimum, where survival was first order, and convenience and quality were at a distant second.

I would not recommend this product to western friends and family.

I welcome hearing from anyone having current status of the Bio Life Technologies company, or how to obtain repairs performed on their product. Tom"
"I have a several years old Intelliseat ISB-200 electric seat which no longer could produce high water pressure. Only by using the remote of a newer second seat could it deliver higher water pressure so I knew that it was the old remote that was malfunctioning. After searching I found out that a replacement remote was no longer available.

I had given up replacing the remote when I came upon Paul M's review (3/18/21) claiming that the remote for the SB-100 bidet seat worked perfectly with his ISB-200 bidet. I ordered the SB-100 remote
for my ISB-200 and it works!

Thanks Paul M."
"I bought this bidet as a gift for my fiance. She really like it but thought that the remote was a little difficult to adjust. But this smartBidet Because of the remote and no buttons on the side for grand kids to play with. The air dryer is not effective and with the temperature on high it Burns half of your bottom. We have small children grandchildren in the house so we will go to the restroom to smoke and it's not convenient not to be able to sit down on the closed lid. That was not mentioned in the description when it was purchased. The heated seat is amazing we will never sit on a cold toilet seat again. It is easy to adjust the nozzle to where you want the water and you can pick the pressure that feels comfortable for you. I would recommend this product for everyone to buy especially if you want to save on toilet paper. You can use a small cloth to dry and then the air dryer to finish it off perfect combination. You won't regret the purchase. The registration for this product is in the back of the instruction booklet and is very small fine print hard to read asks for a receipt that did not come with the package because it was bought on Amazon. Did not find instructions to register by phone or online and we did buy the extended warranty package. OK the only thing that would make this product better would be a hard toilet seat lid that you could sit on and a nightlight other than that it's amazing. PS when are you gonna come up with a kids version that's child safe and easy for them to use.

Sincerely,
Satisfied customer"
Only last three years then started leakage. Otherwise it should be a good stuff for females.
"UPDATE: Seat heater turns on when seat is lifted and seat sensor is touching the lid.

Couldn't install without getting the correct adapter. Did not come with a 1/2"" tee or reducer. Could not tap into the water fitting from the wall. The water valve from the wall is 1/2 inch as well as my existing tee from an old bidet. The bidet uses a 1/2 fitting as well but no 1/2 to 1/2 tube was included. All were 1/2 to smaller 3/8 size!"
"During covid I got into a project mood, and we started upgrading darn near everything at home. Figured, why not the toilet next? My wife and I have been pawning over the idea of getting a bidet for a little over a year (me more than her to be honest.) Well, finally we decided to go for it. No time like the present. 2 days later our thrones arrived. My wife got off work and did her usual routine (3 S's 1. Strip 2. Poop ;) 3. Shower. She was hesitant at first, because well shes not into salad. I watched as she sat down on the warm toilet seat. Not from someone (my wife *cough *cough) sitting on the toilet for too long surfing Facebook, but because this has got a seat tempature setting. Turned it on, little nervous, but excited. ""ooooop"" I knew the warm water hit the spot. That's right, I said WARM. Most bidets dont have that setting, but by george this one's got it. She grabbed the remote swiftly and changed the nozzel angle off her, well you know. Yep, it's even got a spray angle setting. So, if you like thrust power directly on your tush or a water fall near your rear, you have that option. After she was done getting her backside blasted she turned on the dryer. Just to calm down a min from that thrilling cleaning experience. Surprisingly it didn't smell. It's got a charcoal filter that helps block out odors. Who thought of that genius idea??
What I'm trying to say is, buy this. I bought 2. Put them in all your bathrooms. They'll make great conversation starters when guests come over. Dogs will have a clean water fountain. Kids will have a sprinkler to play in. And you, well you'll be satisfied, I promise. Dont make it weird."
"The bidet was very easy to install. It took about 15 minutes most of which was getting my old connectors to the toilet off. The package came with everything needed to install including new hoses and a tee to connect the second water outlet. Everything went well and there was no issue of leaking.

As to how well it works. I have read some reviews on this product saying that it does not clean all the way and there is still a need for toilet paper. I have never had a bidet before so I still use toilet paper (sensor) but nothing comes off on to the paper. I do suggest to use the turbo option (the remote allows the sprayer to move back and forth to get to all areas) with the oscillate option. If you have never used a bidet before beware that your first time will be a little shocking. I do suggest you wait a good 30 minutes after you install it so the water can heat up. One of my most favorite parts is that the toilet seat is warm all of the time (you can turn that option off) which in the cold area I live in is very nice.

I give the bidet 4 stars as it works very well. It is well built and does its job very well. The reason that I am not giving it 5 stars is the only thing I do not like about it and that is that the dryer is off to the side not in the back center so you kind of have to turn to the side a little to get completely dry. I do not know if there is even a way to design it to have the dryer point straight from back to front instead of just to the left of the sprayer when seated but if they did then it would defiantly be a 5 start product.I would defiantly suggest this product for family and friends."
I tried this product for hygiene purposes. Can imagine going back to TP.
"After researching a number of low costs bidet options I went with the SmartBidet 1000. It has almost all the features of higher-priced models but at a more reasonable cost. I think the remote is a must-have feature. I'm a bigger guy and I just can't imagine having to twist to the side to see and operate the controls. The remote on the SmartBidet 1000 is fine but could be better. It's not hard to figure out but could use some design tweaking. It's the difference between something designed by Apple - elegant and intuitive - to something designed by Microsoft - functional and utilitarian. Both get the job done but one does it with more style. The heated seat is great and is a feature that I didn't think was a big deal but after using it I wouldn't want to go without it. The water spray is, how to say this, right on target for me and the pressure seems fine. If you let the water run for the whole cycle it does start to cool off at the very end but I don't consider that a big deal. I still need to use toilet paper but I've reduced the amount needed by about half. The dryer is a little weak and probably the feature that I use the least - besides - it's just faster to dry off with a little TP. I've been using the unit for a week now so I can't testify to durability, however, it seems well made. The deficiencies I highlighted are minor. I really like the clean feeling I get from using this product and so far I'm well pleased with its comfort and operation."
"Overall does the job you just have to hit some angles....super details below

This bidet is on the higher side of what I get, but I splurged. I will say the water temp and seat warm is such a nice feature and it is one of the main reasons I splurged on this one. I try to reduce my waste as best as possible so the air dryer thing was to help that. The dryer is not so efficient, you may wna have some cloth nearby to dab dry. I feel like the dryer only dries 40%. For the length to have spray, that i feel is off. I have to angle myself to have the femine work correctly no matter what setting I choose (it never hits the correct region). Posterior has right adjustments. This is not good for children at all. I had my neices and nephews who all vary in size, age, and gender try and it just didn't work for an actual child but teens good. So don't get this for kids bathroom try another version or one that actually has a multi ft."
"I just got the SmartBidet installed, and so far am very happy with it!

This is my first foray into the world of bidets. Initially I was shocked to see the price difference between the electronic bidets and the water-only options (which were going for $50-$80). I was really torn, but since my water supply in my master bathroom goes through and unheated crawl space, I was reluctant to experience that very cold water waking me up come winter mornings! I took a chance on the more expensive style, and am very pleased I did.

The installation was extremely easy, and the controls on the remote are very intuitive. My children both have tried it out, and now refuse to use the toilet in their bathroom! The hardest part of the installation was wiring an outlet to be near the toilet, but if you don't want to go to that trouble, a simple extension cord can work well.

One installation note: the wand was stuck with packaging, and the first time I used it, the wand did not extend. I remembered another reviewing mentioning this, and that the solution (per customer service) was to unplug the unit, manually pull the wand out, and then plug it back in (at which time the wand would retract). I did so, and it fixed the problem.

The only downside I've seen so far is that the drying fan seems to be a little under-powered, and seems to favor the left side. I've found my right side is still wet after the full cycle, but they mention in the instructions that a quick drying w/ toilet paper is recommended before using the drying setting (which I did not do).

Overall, I'm very satisfied with this unit, and will likely buy another for the other bathroom in my house."
"After more than 15 months, I am totally addicted to this hiney washer. I am so spoiled I hate to go anywhere else! It is surprising how hard it is to convince anyone that hasn't tried it but I have told many about it. JUST DO IT, YOU WON'T BE SORRY!!! By the way, I am on my 2nd roll of toilet paper. Sorry if this is TMI for you but I am 81 and sometimes if I have a doubtful fart, I sit down for a wash even though I don't need to go. I would love to see THE THREE BEARS doing an ad on this thing. Ha!

I wish there was one everywhere! Works Great! I bought this just in time for the run on toilet paper. I don't use much of that anymore. I had a problem installing because my plumbing on a manufactured home didn't adapt to all of the NUMEROUS fittings provided. After I wasted a lot of time I finally contacted the seller and they sent another adapter kit which more than solved my problem. I WOULD HAVE SAVED A LOT OF TIME IF I HAD CONTACTED THE SELLER FIRST!

UPDATE:
Almost 3 years and everything I have said still stands. The SmartBidet still works and looks brand new. I never monitored the money spent on Charmin Extra Strong tp, but I believe this thing is going to pay for itself! More TI, I haven't had a recurrence of hemorrhoid problems in these 3 years. I do my best to avoid using any other toilet, there is no place like home!
Original Review:
I received the item on Feb 12 and have not been able to connect it up to the water supply. A 3/8 to 1/4 (nominal) inch adapter was included but I need a Nominal F 1/2"" to Nominal M 1/4"". I have tried everywhere. Seller, please help me!!"
"So I've had a regular heated toilet seat for the last five years and in the middle of the night during Colorado winters it has been the best luxury ever.

I moved recently and was looking into upgrade options for a replacement to the old seat. I read all the great reviews on this one and went for it. I really wanted something with a heated seat, heated water spray, and easy to install.

This checks all the boxes! I'm a mildly handy 27 year old gal. I can put together an Ikea wardrobe myself or install a new door lock, but I don't own any power tools, if that gives you a baseline idea of handiness required. I had this installed in under about an hour, which includes time to take off the old seat and it took me a little longer because the shut off for the toilet valve wasn't the easiest to access. But it was super simple with easy to follow instructions!
My one recommendation would be, when you have everything all hooked up and you think the connections are tight... Go ahead and give them another twist of the wrench to make sure. I didn't and wound up with a small puddle of water on my floor before I could turn the water back off and tighten up.

As far as the product goes, I'm super happy with that, the water is warm to a pleasant level and the seat is comfortably warm too. The spray is adjustable for direction and pressure. As others have mentioned, the drying option doesn't really do a whole lot for you, but I wasn't super concerned with needing that anyway.

Based off what I've seen for similar bidets, I think the value for this is exceptional! Would definitely recommend."
"This is my first experience using a bidet and I have had it a month. The install was easy even for me and I am certainly no handyman. I did watch a few YouTube videos before installing to make myself more at ease with the install.

The manual was a pleasant surprise. I found the English clear and concise. Sometimes translations to English can be garbled and confusing. That was not the case with this manual.

I experimented with the various settings, especially the positions of the nozzle and the strengths of the stream before settling on a method that works for me. I can’t imagine using the higher strengths or the turbo setting unless I have sat in quick dry cement and need to blast it off my tush! I would describe the highest turbo setting as “painful”. Calling the turbo function a femine backwash is a dreadful mistake.

I use the wash function twice, both times with “oscillating “. The first time strength setting is at the first yellow led; after I spend a minute or so reading a paragraph or two from a magazine in the “library “ The second time is at the lowest setting. The reheating time is remarkably fast.

I am not real enamored with the blow dry function and use bidet towels instead. I have found a blotting motion is all that is needed. With the two step cleaning I have only seen white towels after drying; no left over brown from an incomplete clean.

Reading some of the more informative negative reviews I do have a concern about the longevity of this bidet. I suspect a lot of the problems are due to internal corrosion caused by hard water and/or contaminates present in the water supply. I added an inline filter to the water supply to the bidet. It will be interesting to see if that helps with the longevity of the bidet.

The seat does take up some real estate and somewhat reduces the size of my elongated Toto toilet. The trade off is more than worth it."
"6 Months in, and it works well. I wouldn't call it ""great"" as it is attempting to be a ""one size fits all"" which it is not. It does the job, a lot better than regular paper can do.

I'm 6'4"", so for this to work, I have to move the spray nozzle as far back as possible, and sit as far forward on the seat as possible. Most gentlemen will concur that this is not a comfortable position, given the proximity of ""percy"" to the ""porcelain"".

The wash sequence, as has been observed by others, could do with oscillate being the default setting, and I've found that following with the turbo setting for a few seconds does help clear any unexpected remnants since it gets into the heart of the matter!

The ""drier"" is a complete waste of time for me. It is offset to the left and dries only the left cheek, missing the entire central area as well as the right cheek. It also spreads the scent of the deposit around the bathroom - I use a piece of toilet paper to wipe off the excess moisture instead, it's a lot quicker, cleaner, and smells a lot nicer!

Is it worth it? Hell yes! I migrated here from Europe many years ago, and was used to using a bidet. Going back to plain old paper was a step into the dark ages - if you had fecal matter on any other part of your body would you simply wipe at it with successive pieces of paper until they came away clean? This is a step in the right direction, but a far cry from the ones I saw in Germany, Holland and France back in the 70s!"
"I've used $6,000 bidets at high end hotels. I'd put this seat up against those any day of the week. I have 2 of these and will buy another."
"My elderly step-father fell and broke both of his wrists. My immediate thought after receiving the phone call (and learning he is not in immediate danger) is that my mom will be tasked with doing the unmentionable. I simply couldn't handle the thought of it. I immediately made this purchase. Because I replace the commode as well, I just had the plumber install this at the same time. That being said, I read the directions carefully and am confident that it is an easy install for the novice.

Now for the important part: The Test Drive
Mind you, he was going to be in the hospital and rehab for a couple of weeks, so I felt that it was vital that I completely understood how to use this product so that I could instruct him in all things bidet.
The first thing you'll notice, is that you sit down to nice, warm, welcoming seat. Not the kind of disgusting warm of someone having been occupying that exact spot for the past 60 minutes.....but the kind of warm you get when you step out of a cold shower and wrap up in a towel that just came from the dryer.
Now couple that comfort with the relief of having just relieved and then a gentle warm spray across the nether regions. If the situations exists, it is easy to switch the unit to spray hither and yonder across said nether regions. The water pressure adjusts noticeably. If you're looking for a gentle rain----you're covered. If you need hosing off ---you're covered.
Then comes the warm gentle breeze to complete the task at hand. (Pun intended....YOU AREN'T USING YOUR HANDS AT ALL!! WOOHOO!)
The adjustable temperature of the water and air is certain to please the pickiest of consumers.

Of course the Pièce De Résistance -- How did the old man like it? Please keep in mind that expectations have to be pretty low. He is 86, set in his ways, a little crotchety, and a lot stubborn. He agrees that it completes the task for which it was purchased and my mother doesn't have to do the unmentionable. Aside from that....

He. Loves. It. He gets off of it to eat dinner and to play poker every other week."
"Caring for my elderly parent , a bidet made all the sense in the world : remote control, heated water and seat AND dryer !
I never used one, always thought it was solely for women. but of course I had to use it first in my house just to know how to apply the functions. Surprise, 3 males and 1 female can never go back to primitive wiping again. The price point on the smart bidet vs others with similar functions is not comparable after 3 weeks. Smart bidet offers only a 1 year warranty while many others offer 3 or more. While there is no current issue I believe the heating element may be the biggest issue for any of these bidet seats...time will tell. The wash pressure is very good and hope that the pressure will continue. The position adjustment works while in oscillation mode to clean a larger area. And I do like that it stops in any adjusted position unlike my son who would want it to go fore and aft continuously. The tank holds only so much water and has to refill....for me I prefer a total of 3 tank fills but the cost of a continuous flow system is not worth the price. Installation was easy. The most difficult was aligning the seat plate....measure well. The first time was off, attaching it the 2nd time for my mom was quick , simple and spot on. I am planing on purchasing the same unit again unless the Bio Bidet 1000 supreme comes down in price, it has the vortex function with a little more pressure has a 3 year warranty and is located near me in Illinois. Otherwise I'll stick with the smart bidet 1000."
"Love, love, love, love it! The best money I ever spent! I would have gladly paid double if I would have known that it would be this great. I'm in the 21st century now that I'm not dragging papper across my ass! This does a much better job in just seconds, love it. I did quite a bit of checking and this was by far the best bang for my buck.
I was looking originally to buy a whole bidet, but after hours of research and phone calls, I was told that I could not get a good one for under $2000. So I bought the bidet that fits on my existing toilet and guess what? I love it! My only complaint? Why did I wait so long? Ok so the only minor complaint is that I wish that it had a little larger warm water tank, but jeez, that is minor and the dryer isn't great, but a little piece of tp has it covered. I'm a larger guy and I found myself going through a mega roll of toilet paper about every 3 days and it took many flushes to get it all down, now? Let me tell you that I use a mega roll for easily 3 weeks. It may sound funny to you, after all it's only a bidet, right? But listen, it's literally life changing! Not kidding. The only drawback was paying an electrician to install a gfi electrical outlet behind the commode, but as I said, money well spent! I know it sounds silly, but wow I just love the convenience of having this! I've had my Smart Bidet for approximately 5 weeks and it works great. Good aim, warm water, heated seat, come on it doesn't get much better! If you're on the fence between getting one or not, maybe this will push you over so that you land on the ""21 century"" side of said fence. I find myself literally smiling after each use, yes I love it that much!"
"I had used non-electric bidets before purchasing this. It needs a power outlet located close to the toilet, which turned out to be the best $400 I ever spent having wired. You can't beat the features that this seat offers for the price. Soon you too will turn up your nose at those poor plebs that put their asses on room temperature toilet seats early in the morning.

Never more will you have to grapple with wipe after wipe after you've just finished a tricky one. The nastiest things your colon can cook up won't stand a chance against this rectal powerwasher. It's probably my favorite purchase over the last few years and it will ruin your life because you won't be able to imagine doing a number two from now on without it. If you pair this with a toilet stool like the Squatty Potty, you'll be a crapping king.

Some drawbacks: If you like the water nice and hot, it runs out after about a minute or so, but it comes back pretty quickly. Sometimes the remote gets a bit skittish, which can be fixed by unplugging and replugging. I've owned this for two years and have been super happy, as has the Mrs. While there are certainly better units out there, the features and quality at this price point cannot be beat. My in laws have a fancy shmancy Washlet that costs three times as much but works just as well as this one.

Do it. Your hiney will thank you."
"I so wish I'd thought of getting this years sooner. We live in a hundred-year old farmhouse in the midwest so.....cold winters. The upstairs bathroom is so cold in winter and my little electric heater doesn't reach up to the toilet seat! Sitting down was something to dread. This bidet seat is amazing. Works just as it was described and even has an energy saving setting. Our son installed it for me - with me assisting (which was handing him a tool or reading the directions with him) and it was no trouble at all. Even with no plumbing knowhow, I think anybody could do this themselves. So bottom line (pun intended) is,...,,warm seat, warm water washing me all off, and then warm air drying the nether region. I most certainly do recommend this!"
"I ordered this 2 1/2 years ago for my wife and I and we love it. Easy to install, and water control and temp are easily adjusted. I had concerns about the remote failing, but it's still working great. If you have trouble with the unit not working, but the remote still beeps, change the batteries and you're good to go. The batteries last about a year. A night light would have been a nice addition, but not a deal breaker.

The T valve included with the bidet did not fit my setup. Amazon had the correct part I needed: ""Metal T-Adapter w/shut off valve"".

The only problem I have had is maybe once a month my arc-fault circuit breaker in the garage power panel would kick out, cutting power to the bidet. Presumably when the thermostat for the internal water heater clicked on or off. I don't know if this is normal for the bidet or the bidet is defective. Not wanting to go thru the hassle of returning and getting another that does the same thing, I replaced the arc-fault breaker with a plain breaker. Since then I have had no further problems and everything is working great. I would like to order another for the 2nd bathroom, but afraid I may encounter this problem again."
"I installed this seat on an American Standard Skyline Champion 4. The seller indicated that these seats are compatible with American Standard toilets. Due to a slight curve at the back, slight curve to the sides (high spot in middle) and inability to hand tighten the left bolt (toilet design), this seat would not install correctly without some modification. A 1/16 rubber shim for the bracket and rubber washers under the bracket bolt holes allowed the bracket to be located far enough back for proper mounting. I also had to round the tops of the supplied nylon bolts and cut slots that allowed tightening with a screwdriver. I couldn't find large enough bolts for replacement. The supplied bolts are M12X1.75 with square, non-slotted heads. The largest bolts I could find were 7/16, but didn't feel the head was large enough for the mounting bracket hole.
Once installed the seat works great. The water gets cool by the end of the 1 minute cycle, but not uncomfortably so. Recovery takes a couple of minutes.
I wish the manufacturer supplied a shutoff on the T -Fitting that allowed for seat disconnection/removal without shutting off main water and draining the toilet.
I'm pretty handy, so for the price, I didn't mind making the modifications. Your mileage may vary. You may want to verify compatibility first. I deducted 1 star for the water temp not holding up for the entire cycle. No deduction for mounting. If my toilet had a flat back, installation would have been a breeze."
"This was our first venture into the bidet world. We had a heated seat that finally stopped working; so, the SmartBidet replaced it.

What we like:
1. The remote control. It has several adjustments (seat, water, and air temperature).
2. The slow closing seat and lid. Now we don't have a banging toilet seat or lid in the middle of the night.
3. The overall look. It looks great on our American Standard one-piece elongated bowl toilet.
4. The included plumbing hoses and fittings. All of them installed perfectly, with no leaks.

What we would change:
1. Heat the outside of the water tank housing too. The seat is heated; but, the back water tank housing isn't. So, you do get a cold
""hello"" when your body touches it.
2. The mounting system. The plastic nuts are very difficult to tighten.
3. The size of the water tank housing. It's so large it shifts the seat forward several inches; so, you in effect loose the elongated seat. Plus,
with the seat forward, men may find shielding themselves from the very cold inside front of the toilet bowl a challenge.
4. The posterior water spay. It does hit the spot; but, perhaps just a little wider spray pattern would provide a better wash.
5. The water tank heater. The water starts at the perfect temperature; however, about halfway through the wash cycle, the water is much cooler.
6. The dryer vent. It's too bad the SmartBidet doesn't have dryer vents on both sides; it would then likely provide a more complete drying.

Yes, we like it; but, we have two other toilets in our house, and we likely won't be buying the SmartBidet for them."
"TLDR: Functional bidet with questionable materials and manufacturing.
……..

Review:

Having a bidet is a life improvement.

That said, I’ve been very happy with this purchase until just last week.

After having no problems since purchase (July 20, 2021), last week (9/5/2022–just 14 months after purchase) the seat cover started making a clicking sound upon closing, and the slow-close function stopped working.

Upon inspection I found that somehow the seat cover had cracked where it connects to the actual seat and bidet mechanism. Now, the seat cover makes a cracking sound every time it’s raised or lowered. I have attached a photo of the spot where the seat cover cracked.

No one has ever sat on the seat cover, and we’ve treated the product as expected.

Unfortunately, upon realizing the slow-close function wasn’t working I searched for some troubleshooting tips and found none. What I DID find is that SmartBidet charges $69.99 for the seat cover. That’s an exorbitant price for a seat-cover—especially considering that we paid upward of $250 for the SmartBidet SB1000 and it only lasted 14 months without problems.

Of course, the product is out of warranty so there is no real recourse except to cough up the $69.99 or just live with a broken seat cover.

The bidet functionality continues to work fine, but buyer beware if you want products that will last more than 14 months without breaking."
Works like a charm!
"The packaging was good. All the parts were there. The instructions were easy to follow. I had left my tubing wrenches at work, but regular wrenches worked fine.

I have been using it a few weeks with no problem. The nozzle stays clean because it stays retracted until you start using it. Even though I use the blown warm air afterward, I still wipe a little, but it is mainly to complete the drying process and involves using a fraction of the TP. I have the water set on the warmest setting and it is warm, but not too hot. By the end of the minute washing cycle, the water gets cooler for the last 10 seconds, but it is not uncomfortable, just cooler. The drying air seems as if it could go on indefinitely if you don't stand up or turn it off with the stop button on the remote. Highly recommend it!

Be careful to follow the instructions on installing the hoses to the T-fitting, I initially put the hose to the toilet tank on the top outlet of the T-fitting and that forced the hose to be in a tight ""S"" shape that caused it to kink when I tried to tighten it. Per the instructions the toilet tank supply hose should go on the horizontal outlet of the T, and the bidet water supply hose should go on the vertical outlet of the T fitting. That is what the instructions show, and it keeps the hoses from kinking or pinching. I also used plumbers tape to ensure a good seal on the threads of the T-fitting, but it might not have been necessary. I just wanted to ensure there would be no leaks in that area."
"I'll start with the ease of installation. Coherent instructions, there was no trying to interpret what is written in the product installation. I have what I call ""super toilet"". I don't think I can indicate a brand, so I won't. It's extremely efficient and vacates debris very well. I believe most people rank it as the best brand. That said, I considered, ordered and had shipped to me, a bidet for this super toilet by the same manufacturer. Twice the price with fewer features. I returned it. Very pleased with this product. My experience with this guarantees I'll always have a bidet."
"A rotator cuff injury to ones dominant shoulder is no joking matter. You are simply incapable of moving your arm without exquisite pain. Performing necessary hygienic tasks with a limp arm makes each foray to meet with porcelain queen a real challenge, Short of a Bart Simpson's ""I cleans myself with this here rag on a stick,"" I struggled with the problem for weeks before my surgery. I knew what to expect having had carpal tunnel repair to both left and right wrist a few years ago. Needless to say, a dirty butt and I were not on the same page.

Then one inspired day it occurred to me that there was a solution . . . a bidet! I had been in many high end hotel rooms that had bidets separate from the Queen, but I never had used one. I did not know how to. it sounded like the answer to all my problems. But with a two bath split, finding a location to install a bidet was going to be impossible. After some research, an aftermarket bidet was perfectly suited to the task.

Problem was, I am a right-hander and I only found right hand controls (manual or push buttons) instead of left hand for my good arm to work the controls. No manual units were available and the idea of spraying ice cold water on my underparts was not pleasant. And then, I bit the bullet and purchase the SmartBidet SB-1000 Electric Bidet with heated seat, heated wash water, a warm air dryer and a remote control that I wall mounted on my left side to control the unit.

I know that after physical therapy gives me back most of the range of motion in my right shoulder, I will still be a bidet user forever. This is simply the best, safest and handiest gadget I have ever owned. Highly recommended!"
"This is a nice bidet.

Pros:
-remote works well
-easy install
- oscillating feature works well

Cons:
-you have to turn the seat heat and water heat off after each use or it will keep heating/wasting energy. Does not shut off automatically
-water pressure/power is somewhat weak. I turn it all the way up and it gets the job done
- water always starts out cold and then gets warm
- size - this is a big seat. It will look large on most normal size toilets. I use it in the basement and it’s fine but I would not want this on my main guest toilet"
"Bought 2 seats 3 years ago, and we have had zero problems out of either of them. Both have used every day for 3 years. Im a plumber and I've installed many seats over the years and these are the best bang for your buck. My family (like most Americans), was not receptive to the idea before installing. Now they're all hooked for the reasons below

1. Heated seat... no more sitting on ice-cold thrones. Going on vacation and trips, we miss the heated seat more than anything! It will spoil you!

2. Feminine features. The women of the house will never go non bidet ever again. They say shark week is much better now!

3. Cleanliness. Toilet paper is for drying now, not wiping. Even though it has a drying feature.

4. Saves money on toilet paper! Also, we had no problems during the great TP shortage of 2020 (the air drying feature was AMAZING!). You can LITERALLY go without toilet paper with this bidet if needed.

5. It can also help with constipation! (turbo feature - Enema)

6. If you're potty training kids, its becomes a cool game they get to play and you don't have to wipe them. Double win.

Once you have bidets... its like getting electricity, internet or running water, you just can't live without them anymore."
"My wife had been asking for a heated toilet seat. I figured get the bidet too. I got this after watching the South Park bidet episode :). This has been working great so far. You can adjust temperatures, pressures, location all by remote. It also has an energy saver function that is nice. The dryer on ours failed after a couple of months. I called the distributor. They explained that they had a bad batch, and shipped me a new one within a couple of days."
"The bidet works great but the heated seat is not heated all the time. I had a toilet seat that was heated but with no bidet. The seat was heated all the time and ready for me to sit down at any time. I was expecting the same with this but no, you have to control it with the remote before you sit down. Also it doesn’t remember the last setting for your water temp etc.."
"Okay, seriously, this thing is amazing. Easy enough to install (take off existing seat, unscrew old hose from both ends, screw in T-adapter, screw in new hoses to toilet and bidet, mount bidet, done) and the features on this thing are incredible.

First of all, the remote has an adhesive backed wall holster that also has a couple of holes if you decide you’d rather mount it that way. I’m in an apartment so the adhesive was perfect for me, and it seems strong enough.

Second of all, the fact that it even has a remote in the first place! That’s how many features this thing has. As a result you don’t have this control thing coming out the side of your toilet like some other, cheaper bidet attachments.

Third, the thing self-cleans after every ‘action’. Change modes, it cleans itself. Turn it off, it cleans itself. Turn it on, it cleans itself. Great feature that works really well!

Fourth, it’s got a skin sensor in the seat so you won’t accidentally spray water everywhere trying to get the thing setup.

Fifth, it’s got an internal tank that it holds water in. This means that when you set the water temperature it actually starts at that temp and doesn’t have to warm up first.

Sixth, it’s got a fan to dry you off after you’re done! No more toilet paper! Hallelujah!

Seventh, the nozzle can oscillate, meaning you won’t have to lean around to get that one spot. Of course you can adjust the nozzle to five different positions, and it’ll oscillate on each one if you want it to.

Basically, the thing is worth every penny I spent on it. Do yourself a favor and upgrade your toilet with this thing. You won’t regret it."
"I bought this and the  Alpha iX Hybrid Bidet Toilet Seat in Elongated White  at approximately the same time. Overall, I prefer this one of the two. If I could only choose one, this would be the one. The only thing the other has in its favor is a nightlight in the bowl (and a more forceful rear+ stream that--ouch!--I used once and will never use again). I would never go back to not using a bidet. I hate using toilets without them now.

This seat works exactly as advertised and we've had no problem. I left the seat heated through the winter and it was lovely. I only wish the sprayer would aim more toward the front on the ""front"" setting. That's my only complaint. The water stays warm, it cleans itself. And the whole toilet stays generally cleaner now.

I have been looking at bidet seats for a few years because of the improved hygiene aspects, but could never make up my mind. The leach lines on our septic system have been barely functional for years, thanks to our 2 youngest kids not understanding, believing, or caring about the consequences of excess toilet paper in a septic system. We have been paying $500 every fall to have our tanks pumped for the last, ugh, probably 5 years now. When the system began to slow again this year I decided it was time to remove paper products from our system and let the leach field clear up. And that's why I finally bought the bidet toilet seats. And it worked! We haven't had a clog, back-up, or obviously burdened tank since we got these. We used to occasionally get some funky septic odor in the backyard and, maybe it's coincidence, but I haven't noticed it since we switched to the bidets and stopped using paper."
"Super simple installation. The only installation problems I had were:
1) Didn't fit on my primary toilet. I ended up moving another toilet into our main bathroom.
2) The hold down screws could only be hand tightened. This resulted in a little ""wiggle"". I have a 3D printer so I printed a tool that solved this annoyance.

The wife and I are very happy with this unit. The only down side is it takes a long time to dry. After a few minutes we just grab some TP to finish drying off.

There is a large (ish) section behind the seat & lid hinge. The toilet we wanted to use it on has an upward curve that starts shortly after the mounting bolts. The result was that tightening the hold down bolts enough to keep the wiggle acceptable forced everything forward enough that male users would be annoyed their part touches the bowl. It fit nicely on our other low flush toilet without any danger of the male annoyance. We have about 1/2"" of play between the furthest back position to when it starts to be out of position aesthetically."
This was so easy to install and works great. Very glad that we purchased it.
"I bought this because I was tired of every world crisis turning into a run on toilet paper at the grocery store. And also teenagers who go through a 20 pack of TP in three days (and they’re not decorating the neighbors house with it). And because I missed the traditional buddy we had had in our previous home. This seat was so easy to install even an exhausted single mom could do it in about 10 minutes. And now I have a warm seat in the middle of winter, warm and cold water options, tush or feminine cleanse options (there’s even a turbo setting) with remote to adjust the spray direction. And a heated dryer!"
"My wife has severe arthritis in her hand and had a hard time cleaning herself, we needed something that would be easier for her.
after much research I bought my first bidet in the early part of March and our son installed it, he said it was easy to install.
We liked it so much that I bought a second one for another bathroom in the middle of March, but because of the virus we didn't have it installed until the first part of July. after it was installed everything worked fine except there was no hot water. I called the company and the phone was answered after the second or third ring by a very competent customer service person who spoke very clearly so even a person who was a little hard of hearing could understand him. he asked me two or three questions of what I had checked and I told him. He said the problem was with the bidet itself and he would send me a new one.
I was a little shocked at the fast service this took place Friday afternoon and 3 days later on Monday afternoon I received the new bidet. our son installed it he said it took 30 seconds.
any piece of equipment can have problems either during shipping or something could have happened to it, but the way a company takes care of the problem is very very important and this company has tremendous customer service. I rate the company A + + and the bidet also is a A + +"
"The round seat Biobidet BB-1000 I purchased in 2007 crapped out :-) earlier this year. So I purchased this unit as a replacement for half the price of the comparable Biobidet equivalents. I was pleasantly surprized to find its basically a drop in replacement for my old Biobidet unit, its uses the exact same mounting - just slide it into place and it locks. The water supply connection is identical just disconnect and reconnect and you're in business (no pun intended). Also the Biobidet remote that I'd mounted to the wall controls all this unit's functions as far as I can tell. There are some differences from the BB-1000.

1. There are no indicator lights on top of the unit.
2. There is no air exhaust system or carbon filter.
3. There are no manual controls on the side of the seat.
4. The power cord is shorter (about 2 ft) than the Biobidet equivalent.
5. The seat mounting plate is more cheaply constructed than the old mounting but since I didn't use it I can't comment on its durability.
6. I also can't comment on the remote operation since I'm using the Biobidet remote but it looks well constructed.

The unit is in my bathroom and my wife prefers paper products in her bathroom so I can't comment on the feminine wash modes. Also I since I never used the enima mode I can't comment on that. However the basic wash mode with optional motion and oscillation is very similar to the Biobidet BB-1000. At first I thought that the new unit was a little harsh but after a few week use it feels fine.

So, in short, it looks like a well made product that does the job and I'm giving it 5 stars. Obviously I'll revisit this review if any problems arise."
"I've never used a bidet in my life, but this COVID-19 crisis has forced me to find a toilet paper alternative. This option seemed the best value-to-features.

The seat was surprisingly easy to install and fit perfectly onto my standard sized toilet with tank.

On its initial settings, the sprayer took a bit of adjustment as did the temperature and blower, but the remote makes these adjustments very easy. Now the system works perfectly for me. However, there are no user settings, so when someone messes with these adjustments, I'm in for a surprise on my next use. Also, as other reviews have mentioned, the water will go cold towards the end of its cycle, but I usually stop it earlier anyways as spraying for 45 seconds straight seems excessive. Some have also complained about the dryer not drying well or not wanting to stir up bacteria, but I flush before drying and let the dryer run for a while when using. The result is fresh dryness.

Only other issue is that my wife had a bad feminine reaction after a few days of use, I'm assuming things sprayed into where things don't belong, so she's discontinued use.

All-in-all, I'm very satisfied with this bidet and only use this toilet when the necessity arises."
After purchasing two of these I have given up trying to be patient with product and customer services. The first one stopped working after one year- after warranty expired. I ordered another lasted a year. Contacted customer service and after 4 months of promising to send replacement part- no followup or replacement. Going with another brand. No more excuses.
"The install was easy enough, the design is nice, the features are nice, but the first few uses I was not impressed with, it seemed like the water pressure was low and there was alot left over after several goes. Maybe my culo is too big, idk, but my most recently uses have been nice, it still leaves residue after two washes, but far less than the first few times i used it. I wouldn't recommend you forgo the toliet paper, but you will use alot less of it though.

***Update 2 years later***

I noticed I mentioned the water pressure in my initial review, and while I did figure out how to use it effectively for my use, 2 years later and one move later the water pressure is actually low. It was fine a day or two ago, and now all of a sudden it's barely any pressure and the water isn't heating up. I really loved this toilet seat, honestly when I don't have access to my toilet I almost forget how to wipe, I have to really weigh getting another one admist rising cost if mine isn't troubleshootable."
"The product is for clients to use when a spa day is scheduled. This unit doesn't have enough water power to reach the areas of my clients. And, the sprays are not directed clearly enough to make a difference between the front and the back. I would recommend instead the American Biffy. I had one which worked perfectly and should have stayed with it because this one just doesn't fit the large size women who come for my spa days. A waste of money because it is too late to return it. I'd have to pay to have it take off. And then pay to return it. It is more than a waste as I will go back to the biffy and what do I do with a used bidet??? If you are or have larger bottoms, this is not the one for you!"
nice
"I've never used a bidet. I first saw bidet in my aunt's master bedroom; The separate, stand-alone kind but never got the privilege to use it. This was in 1981 in Ghana, West Africa.

I have been wanting my aunt's type of bidet for about 5 years but most bathrooms just don't have the space nor infrastructure to accommodate a stand-alone bidet.

The solution is the SmartBidet SB-1000. That's a bold statement.

It just works because it cleans. Simple. All the different modes do what it says. Follow up with toilet paper and you'll only get water.

I left out one star for two reasons:
1. Ditch the installation booklet and use the installation instructions in the User Manual. The former needs re-writing.

2. The dryer is ""ifi"". You still want to dry off with toilet paper. This is not too important to me because I already do not have left overs from dry toilet paper wiping and that is good.

The price: over the years, I read so much about bidet after bidet I became paralyzed because of the wide price spread. The features on the SmartBidet is a steal at the price. Stop reading around. This is the one. It cleans, the turbo will surprise you! I use it after I get home and I've used a public restroom. My wife just can't imagine living this long without a bidet, and not having to spend a fortune for the efficiency and confidence in personally being confident to be clean."
"This thing was a game changer for me. So much I wish some one had a portable on that I could travel with. One piece of advice that I learned the hard way, flush the toilet BEFORE using the drying function."
"When I saw a bidet on the amazon deals list I thought it would look at it for a laugh. The only thing was that after I read about it I realized it wasn't a joke and that it was actually something pretty useful. It is so much nicer than using paper and does a much better job. its way cleaner all around.

There are much more expensive models and cheaper models, but this one seemed to be a good balance of features and price. Heated water, warm seat, warm air dryer, soft closing lid and remote control.

Installation was pretty easy and I didn't need to buy any additional parts other than to get a screw driver and thread tape from my tool box. The only difficulty I had was that I had to do my best cirque du soleil move to get both hands behind my toilet so I could twist the hoses together. That was just because of how tiny the space was in my bathroom. that has nothing to do with this product. I had my builder put in an outlet when I built the house thinking I could use it for a night light. I hadn't thought about it at the time but it is also in the perfect spot for a bidet. I got lucky in that regard so I didn't need to bring in an electrician. I read a lot of people were just using extension cords so you can work around that if you need to.

Its so odd to me that its the thing I never knew I needed but I am happy I got it."
"We've been using this Bidet for about 3 months now. I will post a update if I run into any problems in the future. But so far so good. Has all the functions you really need. Heats the water but doesn't last that long, but still enough for our needs. Heated seats. Dryer with adjustable temp. Water pressure, temp, and position all adjustable. Spray nozzle also moves in and out. Soft close seats. Plastic seat seems a little light weight but that might be on purpose for the heating of the seat. BTW my GF really loves the heated seats. Installation was also easy with the included parts. I didn't even need to look at the installation manual. But I am pretty handy at those kinds of stuff. Power cord could be a little longer but nothing a extension cord couldn't handle. All in all we are very pleased with our purchase. We are considering getting it for our parents too. Price point is reasonable. I know there are other units with remote control, lights with motion detection, etc. Personally remote seems to be as a hassle to change batteries and also might be lost or broken. You can also buy those plug in night lights if more lights are needed. I don't think paying all the extra $$$ is needed for those functions. But that's just my opinion. In Asia Bidets are very popular and I'm not sure why they are not more widely used in USA. Once you use one I'm sure you will be hooked like we are. Great product and customer service seems up to par as they sent me a ""Thank You"" card recently with a 6 month warranty extension. That was nice of them. It shows they are concerned about customer satisfaction and take pride in the products they sell. I would definitely recommend this to family and friends. Actually I already do. FYI. I don't work for this company or receive any profits. This is just my honest experience and opinions."
"This bidet is fantastic for the price. It was super easy to install. I usually take a lot of time figuring out how to install even the easiest items but I actually finished this install in 20 minutes. It comes with 2 water supply lines. 1 for for the toilet and another for the water tank. Having new lines that make a strong/secure connection was super helpful. It also comes with a 3/8""conversion nut and a T valve. (I had bought another bidet but it only came with the supply line for the toilet line. I was forced to use my original water supply line to the tank which did not connect well and kept leaking.) The functions on this bidet are intuitive and it has a tank that stores the water so it is warm when in use. Unlike other brands which take a while to heat up. I also like that you get a dryer. Although the air can get a hot! Finally, this doesn't use as many wattage compared to other bidet with less options. This is a bidet is real winner. I wish I had bought it sooner!"
"Out of all the bidets I have used before, this one is definitely the best quality! It is so worth the price and I would buy another one for my other bathrooms. The installation is very quick and simple and the instruction manual is easy to read. The bidet itself is very well designed and very solid feeling...the quality is great. This purchase was more than worth it; I've never felt cleaner in my whole life. It gets the job done and consequently our family uses less toilet paper. Especially with the pandemic and the shortage of toilet paper, a bidet is a great way to solve the problem. The seats are very warm and the water pressure is great.

I never dreamed I would love a bidet this much, and its gotten to the point that I really don't like staying at other people's houses who DON'T have a bidet. This is a great investment and would recommend at least one in every household (also a great gift)."
"As I saw in many reviews the lid and seat are thin plastic. They could be made more robust.
As one other reviewer wrote the elongated seat isn't very elongated. He mentioned having to put his donger on the seat to use the bidet features. As a 220lb 6' tall guy I can concur.
The elongated seat isn't full length. I had to position the bidet forward on the bracket system leaving 1.25"" between the tank and lid. The lid is still 0.25"" back from the edge of the bowl. Doesn't look great but I didn't want to be positioned too far forward when using the bidet.
The total opening of the seat is just a little bigger than a regular round toilet seat.

There were many people who complained that the warm water only lasts 20 - 30 seconds.
This was not my experience. The warm water lasts a good 50s as the manual says. But it also recovers pretty quickly. If you need more wash time just wait a minute and try again.
The was features seem to work well and there is plenty of pressure, even on the low setting.
On high setting there is significant splatter requiring more drying with TP.
The dryer doesn't dry completely without using some TP first.
I don't think it was designed to.
Pad dry everything and let the dryer to the rest.
Over all I like it and think it works well. I am still getting used to it and this is my first Bidet seat."
"We purchased one of these units because of its features, reported reliability by other users, and reasonable cost. After using one for 3 months, we bought another unit for my sister. Subsequently we bought 2 more units for our other bathrooms. We really like all the features on the SmartBidet including the remote control that allows you to adjust the water temperature, water pressure and position of nozzle. Each person using the toilet can adjust the unit to meet their personal preferences. My husband installed all four units that we purchased. The unit comes with all the hardware necessary for installation in most bathrooms. My husband had to make a trip to the hardware store to replace our water shutoff valve since our original valve would not fit the connection shipped with the unit. This was the case with only one of the four bathrooms where we installed the SmartBidet. The other three units connected easily to the existing shutoff valves. The seat fits the elongated toilets we have very well. Our oldest unit developed some problems after 18 months of use. The company quickly replaced the unit even though it was out of warranty. The company offers great customer service and stands behind their product. We have been very pleased with the product and the customer service."
"This bidet is excellent for its price point. It certainly rivals BioBidet and Bidet King, which I have owned both and have no complaints with either except for the cost. I wanted bidets in each of my 5 bathrooms but the cost of Bidet was more than I budgeted for this project. Scrolling through Amazon I found this Smart Bidet at half the cost, under $200and decided to give it a try. I purchased my first Smart Bidet in February 2021, used it heavily for 2.5 years without any issues. I now own 4 Smart Bidets. I had to trash the Bidet King because the seat cracked. O am very happy with this product and have recommended it to my family and friends, whom love their purchases too."
"I have installed it and used it once. Installation was easy. I like the remote instead of having most of the controls on the side. My wife really enjoys the seat heater and the heated water stream.

The plastic is thin and flimsy; I am used to a solid seat and this one is very flexible. It is also made of PP and has lots of warnings about cleaning it. Basically, even though this is a toilet seat, you are not supposed to use any chemicals to disinfect it, you are just supposed to use warm water and vinegar (really?).

As far as the bidet function, I got used to a different bidet that had a knob to turn the water on to the pressure you need. It got to a very high pressure that could even sting your backside, but it always cleaned everything off. This bidet has a soft stream that will never hurt, but also didn’t clean everything in the first two tries. Luckily I use a couple squares to “dry and check.” I will need to get used to using the oscillation feature and being patient. I hope I don’t need to get used to my “check” coming back dirty."
" The most important thing to know is that this will help you have magical poops. I thought I would be ok through pregnancy. I take my probiotics, eat a mostly balanced diet, etc. I was wrong, pooping while pregnant sucks. My hopes with the bidet were just less pain after, I didn't think it would help with the whole process. If you are trying to have a pregnancy/poop life balance, I highly recommend this product.

Other things:
It has a front wash for the postnatal times.
It has a heated seat and heated flow( heated by electricity).
Install was super simple, I had to buy one hose, because of the way my toilet was installed. I also had to buy a small extension cord to facilitate plugging in the seat.
This is only for elongated toilets and does reduce the size of the seat quite a bit. It essentially turns your enlongated seat into a round seat.
The seat is also raised to accommodate the warming tank."
It’s a warm place in the wintertime
"A bought this when it was becoming increasing difficult to find toilet paper. I have never used one before, but thought it would save on toilet paper, I was right.

I have only had it for a few days, and just got the GFCI outlet wired in today. I have been running it with an extension cord from a different GFCI outlet.

Out of the box, the instructions are clear, and install is straight forward. I was a little worried about the water connection because the line between the shut off and the tee, has a different fitting then my current connection to the shut off. But the tee has the same thread and size as the toilet inlet. I was able to use my existing line to connect to the tee. it was just a few minutes work to install the bidet and the water line.

I have lots of hair, everywhere but the top of my head. So getting clean has been an issue for my entire life.

This makes getting clean, so much easier. I feel cleaner too.

***********************************
Update it has been about a month now.

First, the control buttons stand up enough that a totally blind user can operate the controls without difficulty. Yes there are indicator lights, but they are not critical to the operation. It behaves dependable, and predictably so it is very blind friendly. Sighted assistance is needed to identify the buttons, but this can happen fully clothed.

Seat position: depending on the style and make of your toilet, you might want to move the seat a bit after the first install. I did and it really was not difficult. Why did I need to move it? I found I need a little extra clearance under the front of the seat, so that the edge of the toilet was farther from my body.

Toilet paper & Wipes: Everyone is different, and poo is different. For very watery stool, the bidet is super supreme for clean up, rinse and one TP wipe too dry a bit before hitting the air drier and you are good. BUT if poo is like peanut butter, neither the bidet rinse by itself nor wet wipes by themselves got me clean. For peanut butter poo it definitely takes both wet wipes and bidet rinse to get clean, and sometimes multiple applications of both.

Femwash: My wife is not impressed. For female urine only rinse, she says even with the adjust all the way forward, it takes some bending and stretching to get the water where it needs to be. Otherwise she has not had issue with the bidet.

Heated water: This is nice, and if you need multiple rinses, a few seconds (30?) and the heat will have warmed new water enough.

Positioning: It takes some practice to choose new seating habits that are most effective in using the bidet. While the adjustable spray position is helpful, you need to sit in the right place to get the best rinse, as well adjust the spray position, and maybe wiggle around a bit.

Overall: This was a good purchase and a bidet is going to be part of my hygiene tools for the rest of my life. Now I am looking into options to add a bidet to our camper/RV."
"This bidet is fantastic at keeping the seat warm, it has warm water for almost a full minute of spray, settings are easy understand, and the controls are easy to reach and use.
A couple of things I disliked are the anemic spray and dryer. I have a Neo Lux 180 bidet and even on its lowest setting it has more pressure than the Smart Bidet has on its highest Turbo setting. This was a disappointment to find that out after paying so much to get a luxury bidet, well a lot nicer than my cheap one. It will get you clean but you'll have to do 2 or 3 washes to get the job done and after the first wash temp never gets above Luke warm. Being that it takes 2 to 3 washes more you'll end up adding a few more minutes to your time. The other issue is on the lowest setting the warm air dryer can get a trifle warm after a minute or so and doesn't dry as effectively as a hand dryer would. It's most likely that it gets too warm for me and I end up getting up too quickly so others may get more success than I. All in all this is a great bidet with a few functional issues and as I said earlier my biggest gripe is the weak water pressure when my cheap bidet could lift you off the seat if you weren't careful with the pressure dial.

Edit 11/8/22. After using this bidet for over year now I would like to update my review. After getting set up and playing with the options, I have found the spray gets the job done in one go if you double tap the turbo button to get the oscillate function working. The spray does tend to get a little cool at the end of the spray cycle, but that's more informative than a negative. The only negative I have still is the dryer can get quite warm for me so I don't use it that often. All in all I like this bidet and I definitely recommend it."
"I have been using it regularly for about 3.5 years. It worked fine, but now recently the nozzle no longer rotates, so its useless.

I am definitely bummed that it needs to be replaced after 3 years, but I just placed an order for a new one, so I guess that means I am a satisfied purchaser."
"This works exceptionally well. It is missing the fan that I had in my previous home, but I found that it wasn't necessary at all."
"It is easy to install ,it is easy to use. Very comfortable, it is like massage to help circulate the blood around that aera. If you don't have it , I strongly suggest to buy one."
"I love my bidet! It got us thru the toilet paper shortage of 2020, it survived the cold winter of 2022, the only thing this new one doesn't have that my new one doesn't is the dryer, which is fine by us, that dryer was a joke before, so saved us some money and got the same model without the dryer. The heated seat is nice on a cold morning, feeling clean, who knew? Ladies, if it's that time of the month, there's is nothing that will help you feel ""clean"" more than this product. If you've had a baby recently, the cool water helps relieve some discomfort. This is great for general cleanliness and freshness."
"This is an excellent bidet made from South Korea. I purchased the Smart Bidet 100R. The instructions were simple, but I also used the Smart Bidet installation instructions available in YouTube to make sure I installed this bidet properly.

I am subtracting one star because the included adapter is problematic. That is, when I used the adapter and connected it to my shut-off valve so that I can connect the water line to the 3-way valve, a loud and unacceptable hissing noise would always occur each time I flushed the toilet. I discovered that the source of the noise was the included adapter that connects to the 3-way valve.

I disconnected the adapter and went to Ace Hardware and purchased a Toilet Connector (braided steel 3/8 inch Female Compression Thread x 7/8 inch Female Ballcock Thread, 16 inches long).

Once I used the toilet connector from Ace Hardware, the noise was eliminated and I no longer had the unacceptable loud hissing noise whenever I flushed the toilet.

I threw away both the included Smart Bidet ADAPTER and the included Smart Bidet toilet connector.

Thus, for all my trouble and initial frustration, I am subtracting one star from the Smart Bidet 100R.

I hope the people at Smart Bidet consider including a Toilet Connector (braided steel 3/8 inch Female Compression Thread x
7/8 inch Female Ballcock Thread, 16 inches long) instead of an adapter.

I now enjoy my bidet without the loud noise whenever I flushed the toilet.

Hope this review helps you."
"SmartBidet makes a reliable long lived bidet lid for toilets. We have had trouble in the past with hinge breakage on another brand of seat. We have had a SmartBidet seat for several years with no breakage issues. All the functions work just fine. When our Granddaughter said she wanted one we bought another of these for her. I installed the seat both times and had no issues with installation. The seat took about 20 minutes to install. I used a 10"" adjustable wrench, pair of pliers, and a screwdriver. The seat came with the extra water supply hose and special 3 way water fitting that goes between your existing water supply hose and the tank of your toilet. The seats water line branches off the 3 way fitting and supplies the bidet function. Installed all the water lines and tightened them up. No water leaks. These seats need an electrical supply so an extension cord was used to bring power over to it. Seat worked fine from the very first use. No complaints about either seat so far. Excellent design with reliable and durable service."
"After purchasing the SB-1000 4 years ago (still blasting away) I changed to the SB-100R since no one used the air dryer on the SB-1000... Got one for the guest bathroom, one for my 80 year old mom's house (she should get a commission for how many she's sold) and about to get another one for Mother-N-Law's house since she's test driven our guest bathroom unit.
Had an issue with the SB-1000 after the warranty period, and customer service went above & beyond what would be expected/required of any company.
The wall mounted handheld remote is far superior to fixed on the side of the bowl units. Think about it...
Not exactly what ""softness"" means on the STAR ratings.... but you can adjust the pressure, angle, and type of stream."
"This is it! The only reason i would not like this is because it’s a short elongated seat. It fits a full sized elongated toilet but it’s bidet system takes about 1/4 of the space... So, you have to make sure you install it with more room towards the front. I’m 6’, 200lbs and it’s perfect for me... it hit the sweet spot at first use!=ox
The only other issue is that I have a toilet that has the plumbing connections hidden behind & under the toilet so I had to connect at the water source with an extra outlet and another flexible extension hose to feed the unit from the water source.
The remote is smaller than ideal but it works on the opposite wall of the receiver. It has all the extras you need for a truly clean feeling... even for a DIY man!
Update 12/22/2020:
I was going to downgrade my review by 2 stars because it started “acting up.” The nozzle was no longer “on target” and will not respond to the simple command to clean it. The nozzle stayed in and leaked water. The remote was also not working properly.
I suddenly realized that the reason why the first time this thing started to act up was when it was unplugged for a 10 day vacation. We also had our electrical outlets changed to GCI and this this was turned on and off during the changing process...
So, I unplugged it for a minute or two, just like last time it acted up, and voila! It’s now back to normal. So, when in doubt... “reboot“ your booty cleaner!=ox
5 Stars remain in the ratings!"
I only have two complaints about this bidet the hot warm doesn't last but about 3/4 throught the cycle then it gets cold. The other is because i have a narrow butt the nuzzle basically hits me in the butt bone then slides into my crack so i now forced to lean forward so this doesn't happen.
We purchased this product prior to Covid outbreak and just ordered another one for our second bathroom. It basically pays for itself in no time with money you save on tissue!
"I’ve never used this kind of bidet before, but I decided to try this one. This one seemed to strike a very good balance between price and features. The remote for the unit that arrived didn’t work, so I called the company and they had another remote sent to me relatively promptly. Et voila, it worked! Beautifully. Leaves you feeling much cleaner than toilet tissue can. The spray can be rather forceful if you select that level and more gentle if you don’t. As for the drying feature, I can’t tell whether it works or not; either way, I don’t have the patience for it, so I use a three or four squares of paper to dab dry. I think I’m going to order another one for a 2nd toilet.

If you’ve been wondering about bidets, this is a good one. The only question in my mind relates to its durability. How long will it last? How long will it continue to function as if it’s new? So if you’re thinking about taking the plunge, I’d say go for it."
This is a great bidet for larger and heavy(weight) users. It's weight rating is great. I had to search for a heavier duty bidet after my last one broke in half. I like this one so much I bought a second one and installed it at my parents house as well as mine. We both love it.
"So, I got really high one day during the COVID-19 pandemic and decided, “I WILL NO LONGER FRANTICALLY SEARCH FOR TOILET PAPER.” I started looking into alternatives.

Apparently, at some juncture, I decided this was a good idea and bought it, not actually realizing I went through with the purchase.

Lo and behold, it’s super freaking awesome. It has SO many settings and even a SEAT WARMER. This particular model has a reservoir tank that gently heats the water so you don’t have an ice cold stream spritzing your precious bum bum. Because who would want that!? I mean, if you like that kind of thing, kudos to you, but I HATE cold water. Particularly when my junk is involved.

Speaking of junk, it has a feminine setting, too. Meaning, you can aim it at your bits. The first time I did it, I screamed, but it’s something you get used to fairly quickly.

My significant other and I love this thing and we practically race to the bathroom to see who gets to use the “robot toilet” over the regular toilet.

Just be careful about using any regular bathroom chemicals on it for cleaning. It comes branded with, like, 500 warnings to not do that specifically."
"I've had this over a month now, and wanted to wait to give an honest review. I can't speak on the installation because I didn't install it myself.
I can speak on how it works though. My 8 year old son, and both my husband and I use this daily. Honestly, now I want one for the hall bathroom so I don't have to wait my turn for my own bathroom! I always feel clean after using this, and have not once had the water run cold on my downstairs. The seats always warm, the pressure is just right, and the dryer does blow warm.
With that being said, my only cons for this bidet is that the dryer can get really hot if you stay too long, but honestly that actually gives a reason to get off the seat! The only other thing is I notice myself having to pat dry since water tends to go too far depending on your positioning. Seriously though, I don't mind enough. I like that I can control nearly everything. My husband made a good point to flush before you use the dryer, that way your not blowing doody fumes on your hiney. Great buy!"
Easy install over previous SmartBidet which lasted ~3 years. Works well and remote is easy to use.
I currently have a Kohler bidet seat and have replaced a Brondel seat with this Smartbidet seat. I am pleasantly surprised with the seat functions. Everything works well as described and in a number of regards better than the more expensive seats I have and replaced. The plastic construction of the Smartbidet seat and remote are thinner than what I am used to and appear not to be as durable. However time will be the true test. I would recommend to family and friends.
"I bought 1st and liked it so ordered 2nd one for my mom. When I opened the beat up shipping box, there was a manual with some other customer's hand writing,""this is broken. Stop selling this unit"". The parts were thrown in and the tube was used with black cunk. Noticed that Amazon put a sticker on the box thanking for giving this unit a 2nd chance when I bought and paid for a brand new unit.

Also forget drying your butt with this bidet. The air dryer is not strong enough and if you increar the heat you may burn you ass. Just wipe it down with toilet paper. Water stream is good and the warm seat is very nice"
"The seat was short by an inch for my elongated Toto toilet. The spray seems weak. The biggest thing was the water did not stay warm for a full cycle. Last 5 seconds it's cold. Materials are okay, we'll have to see over time. Compared to the Brondell that it's replacing build is not as robust."
This product was so easy to install. My down syndrome 10yo daughter used it for the 1st time and she did great. The child button feature is awesome!
"I have been using Hitrons Solutions' bidet for over 5 years. Last year, I purchased a new bidet from them and after several months of usage I noticed water leaking from the nozzle. I contacted the seller, emailed him the proof of my purchase, and received a new product under 1 year manufacturer warranty. Once I purchased a wireless speaker on Amazon but it stopped working after 3 months. When I contacted the manufacturer/seller to claim my 1 year warranty, they told me that warranty is only for the customers who buy their speaker from their company's website or retail store instead of Amazon. But Hitrons Solutions still guaranteed my warranty even though I didn't buy the product from their company's website.

This is my second bidet from Hitrons Solutions and I'm very satisfied with the quality and customer service. If you are thinking of purchasing a bidet, you should definitely buy it from them!"
"The quality of the product seems good, but it is not long enough to perfectly fit elongated toilets in the US. It's about 3 inches short of what you'd expect."
"Excellence all around. Good documentation, too, which is very important to this engineer. I highly recommend this mildly expensive appliance, which promotes hygiene. This is especially appropriate for aging adults. Appliance requires electrical power and therefore a proper electrical outlet in the immediate proximity of the toilet. That almost certainly requires electrician activity, as bathroom receptacles are always on the wrong side of American bathrooms... necessitating the use of an extension cord (not acceptable!) if customer uses an existing electrical receptacle."
"Never used a bidet but we thought we would try it, now we want one for all our toilets! How did we ever live without one?? My husband installed with no problems. Seat and water warming is definitely a bonus. Remote operation makes using it easy. If guest come over, they can use the toilet as normal, not confusing at all. The only problem we had was that after months of operation, the lid cracked at the hinges (I had read this in the comments that this could be an issue). I contacted the company and they stood behind their product and sent us a replacement lid. Great customer service. We will gladly order from this company again!"
"I wanted a high quality bidet seat but not the high price. This is working beautifully: warm water plenty of adjustable features. I didn't care about a warm air dryer and night light, so I was able to get a really great bidet seat for a great price. EASY to install. Watch the video. Took me maybe 20 minutes, tops. I researched and considered bidet seats for well over a year before pulling the trigger. I am completely happy with my choice. Note: I sat on the toilet seat cover once and I will not do it again. It didn't break but it just seems like it might crack and I am petite. If you don't care about the dryer and the light, this is the one."
"Very solid feeling product. Quality materials used throughout. I find the turbo and oscillate functions very useful. Like most seats of this type, I could take or leave the dryer function. During the setup, I would suggest you install the base plate by itself first, then slide the seat on. Due to the weight of the device, it's harder to install when the seat is already attached. It's also well designed such that the unit will slide on/off the base plate for maintenance so use that to your advantage. Also worth noting for those curious that this is the newer, more full-featured model even though the SB-2000 has a higher model number and is the same price. The description is somewhat ambiguous on this one, but it does in fact have the auto-on seat warmer when you sit down."
"Nice bidet! I wish it had the drying feature, but it still works great. It is a bit bulky, but doesn't look odd or bad, and the features are awesome."
I am reviewing the experience I had with the customer service at SmartBidet. I owned this item for about two months when the heating element stopped functioning. I called SmartBidet and they promptly shipped me a new unit and covered the cost of shipping the defective unit back. Outstanding customer service.
I broke my right shoulder and am right handed so the bathroom cleanup was a problem. My grandson and his wife have one just like this and I had used it at their house. When my fall happened it didn't take me long to order this. I had it installed so can't say anything about how that works but have found it very helpful since.
"Smart Bidet SB110 is a great product. It is easy to install, and like I said, once you go bidet, you NEVER go back! We bought our unit in early 2017 and used it for two years... until one fateful day in April, we removed the seat to clean, and the connection hose started to leak. So I reached out to the customer service team and showed them the part that is broken and asked if there are any replacement part I can purchase. Once contacted the CS team, they came back and offer me a new one and shipped it with no cost to me. It is a dream to have the bidet and it is also a dream to be treated so kindly from their customer service team. I highly recommend their product. Truth be told, WE CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT IT!"
Very easy to install if you can get power behind your toilet. You don't want a cord hanging around forever.
"I have never sat on a seat with such hard, uncomfortable, cheapest possible plastic. The seat stops about an inch before the end of the bowl, it is so small that I feel like I am sitting on a kiddie toilet, the size you find in preschools that an adult would never sit on and the sort of material suitable for kiddie toys. My porta potty seat is larger, better quality material more comfortable and stable. I keep my feet firmly on the floor for stability.

The water pressure doesn't increase and I tried all the functions at the suggestion of their tech support. I understand the one minute limit is for safety, but the auto-clean function cleaning both after the minute and before I can get another minute makes it an ordeal to get clean as it takes 3-5 cycles to be done. My legs are in pain and practically numb by the time I am done. I am a petite female, so I can't imagine a big guy feeling comfortable. I can feel the nozzle touch my butt during the oscillate and self-cleaning function, yet can't sit more forward due to short seat.

My helper installed it easily with no problems. I require a bidet for medical reasons, so am desperate because I can't get the top brand in a timely manner. The tech guy mentioned warranty replacement which might be okay if this is a defective unit rather than a design defect in the product. I read that someone warned the turbo was very harsh, so maybe a replacement would have a working pressure change function. If you had an option of an upgraded toilet seat like a normal American toilet seat that might be okay.

For more than $200, this doesn't cut it."
"I just don't want to wait in line and buy any more of toilet paper in the future. This SmartBidet is exactly what I was looking for. I didn't really need a dryer function but the design and the fit was perfect for my toilet and my bathroom setup. I had asked an electrician to make an outlet right behind the toilet and it was well worth it. Installation was so easy, the mounting plate seems quite sturdy. The heated seat and hot water worked flawlessly. I personally recommend this model to anyone who doesn't really need a dryer, but needs heated seat, heated water. I love it."
"I’ve been shopping around for an electric bidet for a while and I thought this product had most of the features that I wanted with the decent price point.

The feature that I liked about is the nozzle tip that comes on and off, so that I can replace that once in a while. The other bidet that I used to have from Intelliseat, did not have a removable nozzle and it was troublesome to clean it every few months.

Installation was not too difficult. The manual was pretty clear cut so it took about 20-30 minutes to install it.

The design was slim compared to the old one I had and it fits perfectly on my elongated toilet seat.

The water pressure is really good, I set mine at the 4th setting.

I would definitely recommend this model to my parents and friends"
"After building a new, smaller home and not having room for a conventional bidet which we always liked having, this is truly perfect! Glad we put an outlet near the Master bath toilet so installation was a breeze. It does everything you could want in a conventional bidet, there's no cool water shock, and the heated seat is nice. I don't miss the ""heater"" that most reviews said didn't work well... we just keep a small, clean washcloth nearby after washing. After doing a lot of research, we find this is perfect for a really good price."
"I had a bidet from another company for several years. At the same time I moved it stopped working. I looked at numerous models and their review and when I saw the Smart Bidet with what I consider a very good price I decided to give it a try. Turns out to be every bit as good as my first one at half the price. My only complaint is, the same as I had with my first bidet, that I wish the seat was a little longer. A person with a large posterior, especially a male, might have a trouble with the fit. Over all I very satisfied and I'm considering buying another for a different bathroom."
"2 weeks of use so far. Seems to do everything I needed and does it well. The temp get warm or cool, all the way to ""hot"". The pressure also has a good full range. And the dyer works well too. I haven't used the heated seat part, and probably could have done without that. The build feels solid enough. The connections were fine without leaking. The price was better than the others I looked at with the same functions. I still use a little paper to help dry after initial wash, but now I actually feel clean. For a 45 year old man that alone is worth it. Paid $349.00."
"The bidet aspect works great, no issues there. What I don’t like is that on an elongated toilet, it covers ~10% of the bowl opening, reducing it to be more along the lines of a round size toilet. I’m assuming it is to make sure there is enough space for the mechanisms to make it universal for most toilets."
"OMG!!!!!!!! 🎵🎶🎵 Im in Heaven, Im in Heaven""🎵🎶🎵. However, the water is only warm for one cleaning. It will heat up in 5 min, but that's a long time to wait. I would still recommend this. The heated seat is a huge bonus!!!!"
"I only write reviews when there are extenuating or remarkable circumstances. This is one first class company. The product is as described and works far better than I or my wife had hoped. Equally important, it was trivial to install. What was exciting is that it arrived two days before the due date although one attachment bolt assembly was missing. I called this in to the instruction guide number Thursday afternoon. The next day was Good Friday and Sunday was Easter but in spite of this the missing bolt assembly was delivered on Monday. That is incredibly good service and much appreciated."
"After looking at a number of bidets and reviews, I decided to give this one a try. I am very happy with my purchase. It works exactly as described, fit my toilet well (make sure you measure first), and was very easy to install. No issues with the controller. Compared to others with the same features, the price was great as well. I would recommend this to anyone."
"Was really surprised with how perfectly this fit over our current toilet and by far the best feature is having a heated seat. We just recently got a spurt of early winter weather here and it was great not having to sit on an ice cold seat.

Not to mention also the quiet slow closing lid and seat so you will never hear a loud bang again!

The other settings and features were easy to use and work great.

Highly recommend."
"I purchased this from Amazon but had issues and wasn't sure if I'd done something wrong or miss understood the connecting instructions. Called company and they said it sounded like the unit was faulty, they sent me a new one in days before I even had time to contact Amazon of the problem. And now that everything works it has been great. I've had it for several months and now with covid-19 it is an even better investment as you don't need as much paper or wipes to clean your bottom!"
""
Easy to install but make sure you have the right hoses size. I had an older SB and that had smaller connector. We are happy with the purchase the controls panel is connected to the body of seat unlike the remote on older model which I think is better. The buttons are elegant and large enough to read. We have not learned all functionality but happy overall.
"Life changer! I went to try one of these out but only the $40 attachment unit. Worked, but then got curious. YUP, this thing changes your life and I'm upset with my parents for never having this in their house. I missed out on the cleanest of bottoms for almost 40 years. But you know what? Nothin' but sunshine for days ahead, my friends. Take the plunge, it's craptastic!!!! ;-)"
I bought this model FOUR YEARS AGO and it worked FLAWLESSLY. It was time for an update this version oscillates has a remote AND attached controls heated seat simply a great product for the money!
A little expense for what it does.
"I've only had it about a week, easy to install. the Power cable is a little short and since most american bathrooms don't have an outlet by the toilet I had to get an extension. So far works as advertised, the water is warm and the seat heater is super fast. With the toilet paper craziness and a sensitive posterior this is awesome. Everything was well packaged (original packing), instructions were easy to understand."
"OK product. This is my first Bidet to own. It was easy to install. The heated seat is great.
The heated water does not last but about 30 seconds while the wash goes for about 60 seconds.
It does not clean the way I would think it should. No even close to the ones I have used in Hotels. I still need to wipe. I have tried all of the settings to see if one would work. But still not cleaning. I think the stream is too small and not enough pressure. And I do have full water in the house.
So I just wash then wipe and wash again then wipe again.
The dryer feels good but it does not get me dry."
"This cleans so well. You only need tissue to dry,,or a dry clean cloth,,truly! Save money on tissue..
If you have issue with Constipation it Could possibly help with that.
It helps clean so well I’m hopeful it will prevent a female infection
caused oftentimes by wiping n the wrong direction.
Best value for heated seat..posterior and female settings ..
Get extended warranty..I never buys those but in this case might be a good idea."
After 5weeks remote control stop working
The seat cover broke within 3 months of use. It is definitely a design problem!
"Water is hot but only for 5 seconds, then warm, then luke warm, then cold. Sometimes, the seat is hot, and sometimes, just lukewarm. Plus, LED lights stop lighting up on some functions, front 4 specifically. In other words, inconsistent performance. Water pressure is excellent. And I really like the oscillating water tip. Overall, unimpressed. I am returning mine while I can.

Okay, so I did receive a replacement bidet. And it works like a champ. Consistent temperature of both water and seat, how a quality bidet should perform. I commend the seller on good communication. I am completely happy."
"Fantastic bidet, it has seat warmer and warm water. Remote can be located not on line of sight ( not recommended by manufacturer but works for me). Doesnt have Dryer setting but not needed anyway. We have an SB-1000 E/W with dryer unit we never use. Save your money over Japanese brand and fet this one. It comes with all hardware needed including water hose."
"The seat is a game changer. The seat gets more than warm!!!! Love the control settings on the remote. Perfect for the price!

P.S. do not press Turbo!!"
"This was not hard to install as far as the system it self. You will required electrical installed near your toilet, fortunately I know how to do that safely and legally. The bidet works great, warm water, warm seat, one walks away clean and happy without fail. We installed it to reduce the toilet paper in our septic system. It seams to have worked great for that purpose."
This is my second purchase of a bidet I had a TOTO from 2007 and this 110 model does so much more and it is not as bulky in apperance and weight. I love the fan which really eliminates using much t paper. You feel very clean with this oscillation feature as well! Just love it. Tthe price was also a selling point for me.
"Korean knock off of my AMDM Intelliseat which worked fine for about six years, then the water heating element burned out which seems to be a common problem. Hoping this seat will last longer! Seems to be of high quality and works well so far. Water hose and fittings were stainless steel and of better quality than my previous seat. Didn’t use them as the old ones were still fine and the fittings the same."
"Great product, does everything it says it does really well. I grew up in Japan where seats like this are common. We actually have a Japanese one just like this but the plumbing doesn’t work in America, so I was really happy with how easy this was to install."
"I like quality,bidet has all the necessary functions.The seat is sealed and there is no need to wipe the toilet after use. Great price for a bidet with similar features from other companies."
I've had this bidet last week and it is great. I was so excited. It is really easy to install and all parts are included to install. It is only take 30 min. Simple and easy. The seat and water temperature has three setting and you could choose. The actual cleaning wand that sprays the water is great. The wand also oscillates if you choose. The price is reasonable and working perfect. I enjoy this product and happy with it.
"I’m a repeat customer. Bought three more for my family. We all love a but hole. True, lol"
"I feel VERY spoiled having this! I love the heated seat so much, I would rather walk upstairs to my warm seat than go downstairs where it’s convenient. I had a plumber install mine because he was installing a new toilet anyway ."
"Connector to water supply hose is plastic and difficult to attach without cross-threading. I love the functioning of the seat, once installed."
"Been using it for 3 month, working great. The wife said she'd never use it but now loves it.

Edit: The lid hinge cracked after about a year of use. The lid has resistance for a soft drop when you close it. I don't think the plastic is sturdy enough to take the opening and closing over time. Still giving it 3 stars because otherwise we still love it. But beware of putting pressure on the lid."
Make sure it will fit the back of the toilet seat. I bought this for my sister and she had a rounded back end elongated toilet seat. This one will not fit that.
"Discover true cleanliness like the rest of the world has been enjoying for ages, and stop worrying about toilet paper shortages!"
"Unless you want your bidet seat to cantilever out 3"". Otherwise fine."
"I got this for my husband for Christmas. He installed it in less than 5 minutes! Which was his biggest concern ""the installation"". He as well as our family from ages to 3 yrs and up love it! It's the best gift he has ever received he said he could never go back to the original seats! Thanks guys"
"I works and it’s quiet, I bought this to replace one that I’ve had for many years that physically broke but still worked I just couldn’t open and close it. This model has the same features for half the price and quite frankly there is a big difference between my old one and this one. The air dryer gets to hot it burns and the pressure isn’t there."
"Update: Now that I've had this for over a month, even though there is a feminine button by no means is this for feminine cleaning. It's basically a second setting for the posterior. I feel like it is so misleading. It's quite an inconvenience but not enough to return or exchange. If I could help another woman from making the same mistake; that's why I am writing this review."
"Bought this for my bathroom and as of today it simple stopped working. I’ve tried turning it off and on, unplugging it and it won’t work at all. The dryer, the bidet water function, nothing at all."
"SmartBidet SB-110 Electric Bidet Seat, White  I do love this. I love how sanitary it is (unlike our old non-electric one). My only complaint - the power only goes so high; I would prefer the water flow to be stronger as I usually have to do several passes to get clean at max strength. Overall, though, it is fantastic."
"This lives up to the expectations and then some...just be sure to empty the water tank in the toilet first (prior to removing the hose) and make sure the Fill Valve is not moving while the screw/mount is being removed. Otherwise, you could have water all over the place and a broken Fill Valve."
"The SmartBidet SB-100R Electric Bidet Seat arrived promptly. It was packaged well and everything needed for the installation was included. I did the install myself. If you are a little bit mechanical, you should have no problems doing your own installation. The SmartBidet is as described. My wife and I thouroughly enjoy the convenience and cleanliness the SmartBidet provides. I highly recommend this product."
I like everything except that you can not sit on the seat cover because it will break it. You can't put anything on the seat cover because it is angled and will fall of of it.
"It works so well I can't imagine going back: I've become dependent on it. The warm water, the fan, the varied settings, and above all the bidet's cleansing effectiveness have changed my relationship to toilets. I use little toilet paper, I avoid using normal toilets as much as possible, and I find myself showering less. Well worth it the money."
"I was stationed in Japan for three years, these bidets were everywhere and I loved them. I have been using mine for like three days now and I am very satisfied. I still wipe to dry off since I don't feel like waiting on the blow dryer. Will update if I have any complaints!"
"Installed without any hitch and works perfectly. The turbo wash is ""really"" turbo !
I would recommend it again in a heartbeat.

I ordered and installed a second one because the first one worked so well. This is one of the best bidets I have used - even compared to Hotel ones in Asia.

Again the only comment would be to include a valve that has an on/off handle so that the installation and maintenance is easier."
"the product has been excellent so far. had some issues with hose recently and when I reached out to the company regarding warranty options, they sent out a new product instantly in a couple of hours! impressive customer service. highly recommend!"
"The installation was easy. Just in time for the cold temperature, the heated seat and warm water are just a wonderful pleasure. My wife loves it as well. We may get another one for our guest bathroom soon.
Totally recommend it!"
I wish I'd had this years ago. Works great and very comfortable. Warm water and a warm seat if you need it.
"This is our second bidet from this company. Have the 1000 and just got the 100. Never use the dryer function anyway, so the 100 has all the features we need."
"This product has changed my bathroom experience!
This product is now in every bathroom in our house!
Really functional, yet upgrades such a normal routine!
The massage wash and heated seat are different and better from other products I have tested."
"I have two other Toto brand bidets that work great. This one is less than half the price but not as good compared to those. The seat warmer is about half as warm and water pressure is about half of Toto. I guess for half the price, you get half as good a product! Overall it’s a good product."
"Once you have one you'll really appreciate it, especially now. Had it for 3 months and no problems so far."
"I’ve had this for two years now and it’s still working great! It’s self cleans before and after each use, seat and water are warm. The dryer takes a long time so I just pat dry instead. Love this thing! No more wiping your buns like a dang caveman!"
Best thing I ever bought
The instructions were missing from the box but found information on the internet. Seat and water temperature are adjustable. Excellent. Uses very little power.
"I bought this bidet almost a year ago. Since installing it, I use it every day, and it is absolutely worth the money. Though I don't expect it to fail anytime soon, I would absolutely buy it again if that were to happen. This is one of the few bidets on the market that will fit on a normal round toilet seat, and it works perfectly.

Pros:
The heated seat is amazing.
The sprays can be adjusted (with a his and hers presets).
The heat and intensity of the sprays can be adjusted and more than powerful enough at top settings.
The water is perfectly warm and the tank is adequately large enough to get the job done with warm water.
The dryer is as good as can be expected (you will need to sit for around 60 seconds with it on full heat and blast to get mostly dry).
The entire installation took me less than 30 minutes. It is very easy, and anyone with minimal skills and tools can pull it off (providing your water valve isn't rusted open).

Cons:
I have only one major con with this toilet. Unfortunately, the toilet does not remember your settings if it loses power. This is an incredibly dumb design choice, especially in this age where a small non-volatile memory chip costs basically nothing. This is only a mild frustration, but expect to come back to an unheated seat, unheated water, and mild spray adjusted all the way backwards whenever your power blips.

The other minor con is that the power cable is a bit short. I ended up buying a dedicated, thick power extender cable (such as the amazon basics one here) to extend the length another three feet to my outlet."
"We've been using this bidet for over a month. I generally do not like to write a review for a product that has only been used a few times, as that tells you nothing, unless it doesn't work right out of the box. Over the past 30+ days the bidet has worked, with only a couple of hiccups. On two occasions it would not work as reported to me by my spouse. However, before I could even take a look at it, the bidet worked flawlessly the time after. Operator error? Possibly. In any event, it otherwise does the job it is intended for. Installation was easy peasie, contrary to some reviews. Of course, installation ease or difficulty varies with individuals and their respective experience. I'm no plumber, not an electrician, not a mechanic of any sort. However, I do know which end of a screw driver and wrench to use, can put model planes together and change the oil in my vehicle. Other than having to be a little bit of a contortionist to install it, there were no issues or problems. Add to that the cost - - much less expensive than the high end brand we had bought and lasted for only 2 or 3 years. Maybe that is all this one will last, but at least we haven't forked for a stupid amount of dollars to only have it die way too soon in my view. Too, the high dollar bidet required a filter that depending on your water needed to be changed every 6 months. A quality filter was costing well over $20. That's nuts. This bidet requires no filter, another savings. Bottom line: well worth it in the sense of dollars and cleanliness!"
"EDIT: 4 year update -- I initially purchased this product in 2016! Holy moly. Can I say this product is still incredibly durable and 100% intact. All connectors are still going strong and no tubing has cracked. Overall, an amazing purchase. Would rate it 6 stars if I could.

ORIGINAL post:
This bidet was a great purchase for cleaner nether regions. I was a little hesitant at first, not being experienced in plumbing whatsoever, but the installation was relatively pain-free. Except for some spillage of water, the installation was smooth and probably took 1 to 1.5 hours. The only thing that surprised me was the length of the power cord. It JUST managed to reach my outlet with some creative maneuvering but ideally just 6 more inches would have been perfect.

The actual bidet usage is great. It has a seat warmer capability and water warmer capability. It has 3 water washing options (which I still have not found a difference) and 1 blow drying option. It takes a few tries to position yourself for an optimal stream but once you learn the trick, positioning is no big deal. You have to be seated in order to be able to operate any of the buttons, a nice safety feature if you have guests or kids that like to press buttons while looking directly at the bidet. The blow dryer is strong but I'm still a little hesitant to use it. If creates a pretty strong wind and after using the restroom, I am afraid that the fan could be circulating unwanted particles around the air. That's just my opinion.

Anyways, if you think you need a little help washing or just want to up your bathroom game, this is a fantastic purchase. I have had no issues with cleaning myself, or cleaning the bidet. I use normal bathroom cleaner without bleach and it does the trick. I have had no cold water spraying, no heating issues, or jet stream water to date. The two things that really sealed the deal is the water warmer (DOES NOT require warm water port, just AC outlet) and seat heater.

As a side note, my wife loves this purchase. Whenever we go back to visit her parents, she will always mention that she misses having the bidet at home out of all the things that there might be to complain about."
"I have had this for a few months over a year now. The bidet function works well most of the time. Occasionally, it makes sound and squirts a little water but doesn't actually come out and spray. This is easily remedied by lifting off the seat too reset it and attempting again. I like that you can adjust the intensity of the spray. I enjoy the different heat settings on water and the seat, it is nice changing the temperature with the seasons as needed. It is easy to clean for the most part, just a little difficult between the tank and seat. My biggest and only complaint is that you can't actually sit on the lid. If you could actually sit on this it would be a million times better. I'd like to sit on my toilet lid while I dry or straighten my hair, brush my teeth, etc and it is a huge disappointment that I can't, especially for the price"
Bought this on a whim and couldn’t be happier. Install was easy - came with the parts to install on most common toilets. Easy to use and works great. Love the slow close lid too.
Like a lot of people I was skeptical about this but now I love it. Good quality and efficient.
"After watching the movie ‘Why Him?’, the husband & I were so interested in the ‘paperless toilet’ so we were going to purchase one. We found one at Home Depot or Menards, and it cost about $1400.
We decided to do a little more homework on them to see reviews and if there were other types... I was looking around on here (Amazon) when I came across the toilet seats the basically do the same thing, but are easier to install, return and are a small fraction of the price.
After looking at all the different models, we decided to choose this brand because of all the functions and reviews I had read about it.
Our plan was to purchase one first, for the guest bath, see how it went & then possibly buy another for our other bathroom.
Long story short, we loved it so much, that we immediately (I mean within an hour of installing the first) purchased a second for our master bath, and they are both amazing!!
At first, it definitely takes an adjustment period for not only getting used to it, but getting it set/programmed to what works for you, such as nozzle position, water temperature & strength, and the exact spot to sit on the seat (if your an on the edge sitter, this might not work well for you).
Once all of the logistics are figured out, the amazing part occurs!! Such as the super~clean feeling you have after doing both number 1 and 2’s!! And the money you will save on toilet paper & wipes!! The dryer on it works well, but I always feel the need to do one small wipe after.
It has a temperature adjusted heated seat which is awesome, btw!!
Anyway, as seen in the pictures provided, it has multiple spray options which all work the same, but spray different spots and they are operated by one touch of the button and you get a straight spray shot, hit the button again (while it’s still spraying) and it oscillates. Each spray lasts roughly a minute but can be repeated by hitting the same button again, or it can be stopped at anytime by hitting the ‘stop’ button. It’s pretty explanatory on the operating pad.
Both my husband am I love it and the ‘clean’ we feel after using it and now cannot imagine going back to using just toilet paper & wipes!!
We both highly recommend. 😊"
"I got it on Oct 7/2021
It lasted for a little over 2 years.
The water heater started to not work and water continuously flows out near the nozzle. I tried to contact the company and they just ignored me and again I emailed them but again no response, I am just leaving a review so you're aware of what kind of customer support they provide if you have any issues with the product in the future."
"We bought and installed this bidet about a year ago and I really enjoy using it! However, one thing I had not given any thought to until it was installed is that the angle of the lid means I can no longer sit on it when not in use. This has been surprisingly annoying and challenging -- I guess I never thought about how often I use our toilet as a chair in the bathroom! I would sit on the closed lid to get dressed after a shower (put on socks, pants, etc), while chatting with my partner while he brushes his teeth, waiting for a kid to get out of the bath or shower, etc. Now the only place to sit in our bathroom is the edge of the tub, which is far less satisfactory. I wish I'd thought of this in advance!

That said, I do like using this bidet. The heated seat is great, the warm water is great. I find the dryer too slow and smelly to use, so I do still use toilet paper for drying. In our family of four (ages 12 to adult), I am the only one who likes using the bidet.

If I had it to do over, I would look for a bidet that would have let us keep our original toilet seat lid, or has a flat lid that can be sat on."
"This is an integrated toilet seat and bidet. Save money by not for not buying a separate toilet seat.
The control is on the side and difficult to see and select the right button. May be will get used to it in sometime. Sprays water well. Temperature control is good. Heated seat is nice. If it malfunctions, cannot be fixed and it will be an expensive replacement."
"Pros: warm seat, warm water, warm air. Clean tush.
Cons: pooping anywhere else is awful now lol"
"I purchased the SB-2000 Round and I am extremely satisfied with all the features of this bidet. Heated seat, heated water, oscillating head, pressure adjustment and more... This is my first bidet and I truly could not be any happier with this investment."
This one is good. I like it. but it took a while for me to install it. Otherwise it is Okay. I don't have any complaints against it yet.
"I got this since I'm a big hefty man, and I was going through 3 MEGA Charmin roles a month, and I am very conservative of my paper usage. Averaging about 21 squares for a bad visit at most. 10 squares on average. Got it down to a science. ANYWAYS... There is a lot of things you need to take into consideration here. This is a hard thing to review. Normally I would go: Pros, Cons, Conclusion. I'll forego that and just list observations.

-Install: was rather easy. No issues there. My toilet is isolated into its own room in the Master bathroom suit, so had to use an extension cord to plug in the heating element.

Using it:
1) setting up the nozzle angle was easy but never feels quite right. I feel like there is a lot of wiggling to be done to get a clean experience.
2) I DO NOT RECOMMEND using the dryer feature, that's just wafting ""particulates"" back into your face and all over the room. If the seat created a better seal then I would say it wouldn't be too bad, Since I'm a chunky enough person to create a seal on top. Also because there isn't a gasket underneath the seat, means a lot of that drying air, escapes.
3) I don't see how this is a cleaner or more hygienic offering. There's a lot of splash back and whatnot. As a man, a part of me acts as a backboard that water hits. As a woman, I'd be afraid of getting tainted water up there. Even if diluted, you're getting gross water in places it doesn't need to be.
4) since the dryer is kind of out of the question, means you're wiping yourself dry. AND there I've noticed I need almost as much toilet paper to dry myself as I would normally use with a visit.
5) The spray/dry cycle seems sporadic and not uniform.
6) I found that the ""female back"" option better hit the spot, than the male back option which always shot too high, even at the lowest angle. Less wiggle needing to be done on the ""female back"" settings, but definitely the most splash back to the ol backboard.
7) the sprayer lost pressure on the male settings, must have been clogged, apparently the purging isn't that good.
8) YOU HAVE TO WIPE, since sometimes, a lot of times, if I don't do the dance just right, it's not cleaning much of anything and you don't want to put that back in your pants in that state of mess.
9) The heating is only good for one cycle and then right back to 60F water which feels REALLY COLD.
10) I ended up having to remove the lid since it dug into my back too much while using the seat. LUCKILY it's rather easy to remove. The lip on that lid is obnoxious. It literally sticks out over an inch.

Conclusion:
While I don't regret it, I don't know if I can recommend it. I bought some Tushi brand ones to try out in my other bathrooms. Those were a third of the price and use the water from the hot-line of your sink. It's your call. It's expensive, but I don't think it's overpriced."
"We purchased a SB-2000 Smartbidet in 2019 after my wife’s trip to Japan. She has enjoyed it and especially the heated seat. HOWEVER, 1.5-2 years ago it started making a cracking sound on the side of the damper as the top cover was gently raised and lowered and eventually the plastic cracked and the cover would fall without damping. I replaced it with a new cover but 1 month ago the same problem reoccurred. It makes a cracking sound intermittently and the plastic has cracked. It still dampers. I called customer support and the first agent suggested that the damper might be broken. I purchased the damper but didn’t replace it because the damper appears un broken. It is not worth it to return because of postage. A second agent was very pleasant, took a lot of time speaking with me but had no explanation as to why this keeps occurring and the only solution is a new cover. I will not buy a new cover for 69.99 for it only to last for 2 years. We will just keep the seat cover up."
"Soon after getting it, the flap over the drier broke off, and less than a year after owning it, the tube piping from the faucet to the seat has begun to leak, even after trying to tighten it.
The pressure also isn't adjustable, so it can be a bit too much in a lot of cases."
"really love it! slow closing lid, heated seat, rinses before & after use, has options for both womens uses & mens, warm dryer, easy to install, softer spray for women’s front, and helpful customer service support!

only downside is that you can’t set the position to remember where your frontside or backside is for each womens & mens setting. it was easy to call their support and ask. but i really don’t think any other bidet company has this feature. would definitely recommend coming up with this technology for the future as it would be a great seller!"
Now that I have your attention - Seriously this is the best thing ever! I’ve had it about 3 weeks now and it has seen me smoothly (pun intended) through a colonoscopy prep. Install is fairly easy - I have a tight space to work in. The learning curve is short. In just a few uses I memorized which buttons to push. Still on the same roll of toilet paper too. With this appliance modern life is truly a blast!
Too bad we don’t install bidets everywhere. It’s wonderful and worth the money.
"My wife and I had one for 2 years in our old condo, and it was excellent. Just moved into a house and are planning on picking some up for so of our bathrooms!"
"I am a 64-year-old woman who had never in life used a bidet of any kind, anywhere. After doing a lot of research, I decided on this once after the determination that a manual bidet wouldn't give me all of the features I would like to have. This item has at least most of them, plus some I didn't expect and was pleasantly surprised. This model seems to have more features than many others available without breaking the bank.

I easily installed this myself. It actually took me longer to find the tools than to install the seat. There was absolutely no need for any additional equipment. In fact, I have a left-over metal water-connection hose since I had no need to change the existing one, just unscrew it from the toilet tank and reattach it to the adapter that turns 1 connection into 2. I had read stories from people who experienced leakage, but I suspect they've either under-tightened, over-tightened, or failed to use enough of the Teflon tape or their choice of sealant. The power cord was just long enough to reach my outlet without an extension. I added a single-plug GFI outlet  TRC 90033 Shockshield White Portable GFCI Plug with Surge Protection  since my old home has no such outlets.

I knew I couldn't tolerate cold water alone during the winter and this model heats. Beware and use the lower heat settings first until you find the one that's comfortable for you. This also applies to the heated drying feature. My first experience ended up with an uncomfortably overly-warmed left bun.

There's definitely a difference in water pressure when using the his vs hers settings. I'm no small woman; nevertheless, the highest setting intended for males was too powerful for me. This is also something that is adjustable-the water pressure.

All features/settings/adjustments are done from the remote control. I chose this model over the SB-1000. They've identical features except the fixed remote (SB-2000) vs. the SB-1000's detached remote.

When you choose an electric bidet seat, compare this model's features with the high-priced competitors. I wish I had known about and purchased this years ago.

The only reason for 4-stars-it has only been installed for 1 month so I can't speak on its longevity factor."
"My rating is five stars.

I really like this product.
I was more satisfied than any other product.
However, there are some regrets, but I give you 5 stars considering that.
This product has similar performance to other products.
But the difference is that it has an enema.
Among other products, there is no function that even does the enema.
It says yes, but if you use it, it doesn't become an enema
I keep feeling like I have poop left in my stomach.
This product is satisfactory because it has good enema.

The unfortunate thing is that the power cable is short.
I want you to make the cable longer so that I can cover both left and right.
And it is hard to clean the nozzle when cleaning.
It has an automatic cleaning function, but it doesn't get 100% clean, so you have to clean the nozzle yourself, but I bought another one because it was broken while pulling it out by hand.
This time, with the nozzle out in front, the power cable was unplugged to stop the nozzle, and then the nozzle was cleaned and turned on.

The positive aspects outweigh the negative aspects.
I bought it again, and I will buy it again.

I hope this review is helpful when purchasing the product.
You won't regret it"
"After using these while stationed in Japan we recognized the better lifestyle of bidet use vs TP and, when covid hit and everyone was hoarding, we were flush. Plus we are on a Septic Tank so this is even better for that. Overall works very well. I am over 210lb and wife is 125. Have had the SB 1000 elongated for 4 years and noticed that the seat, which has discolored and become brittle over the years due to the heater inside, has finally cracked on the under-side, where the bumper is that meets the actual porcelain . So, time for a new one. We had to add a bowl light. I am about to buy a new SB 1000 and I wish it had one as does some of their competitors."
"This is the third bidet that I have purchased. After a vacation in Japan (where bidets are widely used), I just had to get one for my home. The first one I bought was the Washlet (Toto-Japanese brand). It was pricey but has so far lasted 2.5 years and still going. I love the cleaning concept and heated seat. It worked just as well as those I used in Japan. I had just remodeled my second bathroom and wanted a bidet for it. I noticed there were many more models to choose from. I selected a Woodbridge that I had to return as it was made for a specific toilet (it needed 4 holes to fasten the seat, hose and electrical cord). I then selected the Smart Bidet which was nearly half the cost of the Washlet. As in the Washlet, the Smart Bidet installed easily and quickly two weeks ago. It worked fine at first but then one of the wand settings stopped working as if one of the holes in it might be clogged. Unlike the Washlet, the Smart Bidet has no wand cleaning feature or filters. I don't want to return this as I have been using it but so far I'm seeing that you get what you pay for. The Washlet is ""tried and true"" and worth the $150 extra bucks I paid for it. The Smart Bidet needs some more development in the research labs."
"First of all, we've been enjoying squirting ourselves in the butt. The controls are clear, though a backlight would be extremely helpful. The heater works quite well, and the temperature settings seem to be pretty good. My husband prefers higher water pressure, but I think he just may not have found the water pressure button yet. I wish the seat wasn't so flimsy. It's just an empty molded seat, not solid at all. I'm not especially large, but the seat doesn't feel like it'll last very long. In addition, I wish the fasteners were metal. Since the mounting point for the seat is plastic, the fasteners have to be, too. Unfortunately this means the seat isn't as secure as it could be. Overall, a good purchase with a few drawbacks."
"I have this seat for a few months now and it's been working out really well. The decision to get an electric bidet was made after our trip to Japan where electric bidet is standard equipment for any toilet.

There are many plusses for the bidet compared to a regular toilet seat.
1. the seat and the cover is damped so when you close them, they don't slam down onto the toilet seat
2. the seat is heated (user selectable on/off) and it's wonderful in the winter
3. the heated water jet is a delight to use. One can now confidently use white underwear without worrying about ugly yellow stains...
4. very little toilet paper is used

Now regarding this particular electric bidet - 2 negative things about it.

1. The plumbing assumes that the existing line to the flush tank is removable (screwed fitted). You remove the flush tank line, put in a provided splitter which goes to the flush tank and to the seat. Look for a video on youtube on this bidet...it will show you the instructions. Make sure you view it to see if your existing plumbing is compatible. Pretty simple unless the existing line is not removable like mine. I had to do a bit of plumbing to put in a removable line so I can install the splitter. Cost me a day and a trip to Home depot. A smarter design would be having a splitter at the base of the flush tank like the Lotus bidet uses. This is why I only gave 4 stars.
2. The instruction is bolded on not to use any kind of chemicals to clean the seat...just water. This creates a minor problem for me to keep it clean to the condition I'd like."
Needed to buy part to connect to my toilet but once installed is excellent. For the price it had all the features you’d want. I personally like the controller connected to the seat vs having a remote
"If your wife is pregnant, show her you love her and buy this. If you are pregnant, respect yourself and buy this. After getting pregnant with baby number four, I decided that having to wait for the faucet water to warm up for two minutes in order to fill a peri bottle every time I took a wee was just too much--the whole postpartum bathroom process is already complicated enough, having to wear adult diapers and pads and use hemorrhoid wipes for a whole month or more. I went ahead and bought this after some research, installed it myself (super easy, even being massively pregnant), and have enjoyed it for several months now. The baby is here and I feel way more clean than I ever did during the first few months with my other kids (if you've had kids, you know that's a rare feeling). My husband was skeptical at first but he loves it. The water and seat are always warm, no need to wait. It has all the bells and whistles of a much more expensive e-toilet, and they all work great. We did need to adjust the water pressure at the floor valve, since it was way too much at full pressure (it would spray the wall six feet away!). I've seen other reviews complaining about not enough pressure, but ours could very well give one an enema. We don't use the dryer hardly at all as it takes a while and can spread sharticles through the bathroom--though I found a little essential oil rubbed on the dryer can fix that. Using a regular toilet feels so archaic and unsanitary now."
"So I don't often write reviews and I should do so more often when I use a product I really like and performs especially well. Also, I want to give a nice shout out to their customer service when I had questions about the product. Guess what...when you call the number a real person answers after a few rings. No crazy IVRs...you get to the person who can and wants to help you with your purchase.

Now on to the product. I have used this now for 2 years and absolutely love it. Our whole family loves it and I can't ever seeing myself going back to the old ways. It has all the bells and features found on more expensive bidets at a fraction of the cost. It is a solid construction and fits both the lighter and heavier people in the house without breaking, slipping, etc.

The water pressure is perfect for all situations and the heated seat and water make it especially nice. If you are a person who likes to hide in the bathroom using your phone for hours no better seat than this. Of course our bidet really paid for itself once Covid hit and there was a shortage of TP. Don't need it and your body likes cleaning with water rather than all that paper which on hindsight never did a good job.

For for young, old or in-between you can buy this and really enjoy your purchase feeling cleaned and refresh every time you use it."
"The Bidet itself is wonderful. Super easy to install and use. Solid quality for the price. Unfortunately, the Bidet connect the T- Connector is pure garbage. I bought two bidets one for each bathroom and both leaked and squirted water. Had to go to HD to purchase a quality one."
"I have bought in the past several of the SB-1000 bidet seats and since then have acquired several more toilets. Though I would give this model a try and I do like it a lot.

Very slightly different it seems in the shape of the seat itself. The SB-1000 may be slightly more comfortable , but with this model the advantage is no batteries to replace in a remote. The other has a remote, with no other way to activate it, so over all, it's a toss up.

To be honest, in the different locations where these seats are, the climate is mild to tropical, and I do not use the heated water or heated seat, and almost never sit still long enough to use the dryer. Just blot with paper and go. I could see that these features would be very nice in the frozen north, though.

I can also compare these to the KOHLER K-4737, some features on the Kohler are nice, in that it has a light and a power button and automatically enters energy saving mode after 24 ours of no use. It is nice to be able to go away for months and not have the heated functions left on by accident. The night light on the Kohler is cool. These features would be trivial to implement on the SmartBidets. Found the Kohler for $200 less than the price on Amazon, at Costco, about $50 less than this one. The Kohler is made in China, where this one is made in Korea, I believe. The Kohler does feel a little cheaper in over all quality and is noisier.

On all of these seats, the actual seat needs to made flatter and wider for large American butts. Asian butts are also getting larger, I've noticed on recent trips.

Anyone listening?"
"Works well, easy to install. Unfortunately, most bathrooms in America don't come with an outlet close to the toilet so you may need an extension cord. My biggest complaint is that every other toilet now feels like just a hole in the ground. Hopefully some day they'll make the product worse to prevent this from happening."
I liked how easy it was to install. It’s comfy too. My only two issues is the bidet at full strength isn’t as strong as my previous bidet. And the dryer seems pretty weak at full strength too. But never had one with a dryer before.
"I lived in Japan for 10 years and got addicted to these things. I love them so much I brought 4 of them back from Japan with me. That's been over a decade, and those have started failing. I've bought several of these SmartBidet's for myself and family members, and they work just as well as the Japanese (Panasonic) ones. They could do away with the dryer, though. There's just no way that would ever work."
"I've owned the Bidet for about 6 months now, and have mixed feelings on it. I would have given it 5 stars for it's performance when it worked; however, it has failed to work properly over the past couple months. I working on the warranty claim right now.

Basically, this functions very well when working. The heated water is nice, and it's very comfortable. The warm air drier is a nice touch too. I did notice that parts of the toilet blackened over time. It looked almost like mold, but wasn't. It's strange.

A couple months ago, it stopped working. One of the lights on the bidet would flash, but none of the functions would work. If I unplugged it for a couple of minutes, and plugged it back in, it would work fine. After a couple weeks, the sprayer stopped working properly. It would often get stuck in the ""in"" position, or the ""out"" position. If left in the ""out"" position, it would blast you with the high pressure rinse cycle that made you feel like you had just got done gargling water.

If it wasn't for the issues I'm having with this, I'd highly recommend this. I don't see many other issues like this being reported, so maybe this is unique.

Edit:

I just got off the phone with warranty, and they were very easy to work with. They are sending me a replacement part right now. I've upgrading from 3 stars to 4 stars."
"Like many others, I had hard times to find “toilet paper” at early of this year and finally decided to buy bidet seat , but before purchasing, I have searched many of popular bidet seats and found smart bidet seat has a lots of model options with most favorable customer reviews, however, one of my biggest concern was, can I install by myself (I am not handyman or tech guy) -or- do I hire handyman to do it and another cost around $100-$150 ?

Once I tried to install it, it’s just easy and everyone can follow the instruction, it took only around 15 min for me when opening box to completion. It came with all necessary accessories included, only need is “screen driver”.

This bidet seat has plenty of great features, specially, “unlimited and on-demand heated water” brought my attention, because many of other bidet seats took times to use warm water after heating but SB-2600 can use warm water immediately,

Also it has heated seat, water & dryer's pressure/temperature are adjustable, Touch attached control panel, stainless steel & self-cleansing nozzle, each wash infuses pockets of air bubbles, which results in power behind the wash. It even has a Child button and a soft closing lid.

Overall I would strongly recommend to everyone to buy smart bidet and it will bring new world to you and family, it’s a great bidet products and can save tons of toilet paper/money at your home."
I bought the Sb 2000 in 2017. Any one know how to replace the seat thermal fuse?
"Installation was easy in our particular setup. Included plumbing connections were exactly what I needed to install it. As you face your toilet, water inlet is on the left, power cord is on the right. Bolts to secure the seat are WIDELY adjustable, to the extent that I can't imagine a toilet it would not fit. However, when installed on our elongated bowl, the seat extends about 3"" beyond the bowl. So when seated, guys will have to be extremely careful not to shoot between the rim and the seat. You kind of have to tuck back a bit to hit the bowl. I can't move the seat back any further without it hitting the tank, so it's as far back as it can go. The lid is a little flimsy and makes the toilet seat lid no longer a convenient seat in the bathroom. The lid is quite slanted and when you sit on the lid, it's quite wobbly.

Washing features seem good. Powerful stream, movable nozzle position. My wife indicates the ""Her Front"" doesn't quite come far enough forward to do the job unless you adjust your position. Water and seat heat functions work great. According to documentation, the water heater can handle ""50 seconds of heated water in a 60 second washing cycle"". 60 seconds is a long wash, so I don't think 50 seconds of heated water will be a problem."
"This is about my 6th automatic toilet over many years. Different brands and features, but coming from the same OEM.
This one is typical with heated seat with temperature adjustment, bidet with temperature and water pressure adjustment, adjustable heat/speed dryer, soft-closing seat and cover, and different spray pattern for ""her front"", ""her back"", and ""his back"".

Heated seat is very comfortable and especially nice on cold days. Bidet/dryer function reduces toilet paper use and helps the septic tank. It does not completely eliminate paper because the dryer is not that effective and takes too long, but it only takes one wipe with a small sheet.

It is easy to install and remove. You just remove the old toilet seat, then install the mounting plate. This bidet slides and snaps into the mounting plate, so it is also easy to release with a press of a button (which also empties the stored heated water). All parts are included and nothing else is needed. You might need a screwdriver and pliers to remove the old seat, though.

This easy release feature came in very handy when this this unit happened to stop working properly (""his back"" function stopped working) within a week of use. This is the only unit that failed out of all the units I owned. The customer service was excellent and sent me a replacement right away. This is a company that has a good support and I am very pleased with it.

Use this unit once and you will be sold.
BTW, this is indispensable for colonoscopy prep. You know what I mean having to evacuate dozen times before the procedure. This bidet makes a world of difference in comfort."
"I've been using bidets for a few years, and it's the only way I like to conduct business on the toilet now. So everywhere I go, a new bidet comes with me. My usual go-to bidet is the brondell unit, but after having a failed attempt with that one fitting properly on my toilet, I decided to try this unit out because they specified their measurement requirements. I checked my measurements and I was in the clear. So I ordered the product. Got it two days later only to find out it fits exactly like the brondell does. It's technically usable, but the thing between my legs would touch the bowl of the toilet if I actually sat down to use it. That's a big no from me, dog. I am not at all happy with the fit, and will be returning the unit. The company needs to recheck their measurement requirements. The unit itself feels of average quality. The brondell is definitely more sturdy."
"I purchased this seat for a family member who has some mobility limits, this seat allows this person to use the toilet without any assistance from anyone else. Cleans the bottom and dries when done. My spouse tried it too and says it works well. I have not had the opportunity to try it yet. I have installed several of these over the years as a professional plumber, this seems to be as good as any other that I have installed.
I do wish that there was a spot to install handicap handlebars.
Update
I have now tried this toilet bidet seat, I think that it works well. I highly recommend this to everyone. Pretty easy to use. Even my family member who has trouble reaching back to wipe says that it is easy, however they do have trouble seeing the buttons. Now that they have been using it for some time they are used to just operating the seat by feel, they just count back from the stop button to the buttons desired, i.e. her back, her front, his back, dryer.
My only letdown is that the bottom of the seat is hard to clean, the seat is made of 2 parts to allow for the seat heater, this seam is hard to clean. This is why I reduced the score to 4 stars."
"Control panel has all the gadgets. I like how you can adjust strength and heat of water. It's not too hard to clean. I hope they have some sort of sanitizing metal in the nozzle like good bidets do, but I cannot say. I've had for half a year and not noticed any odor buildup. So good value overall. Water and seat heats up quick and it has an eco mode that senses when you sit, I think that's good. I need to use a bidet for colorectal issues and it has saved me so many times, nearly everyday. Make your bathroom experience more enjoyable! I have to say that I don't love the nozzle position.
I may sit on the toilet differently idk, I think I just sit normal, back to the tank, so here's the issue: Even though it's adjustable, the nozzle doesn't really go back far enough, I find myself shifting positions to get a good wash."
Bought it a year ago and absolutely no regrets. Highly recommend.
"It does everything promised, and the variety of options makes customizing it to fit YOUR needs and likes is perfect. Those who complained about the men's rear wash being too strong for comfort, must not have tried adjusting it. I tried all 3 selections and the men's is just right for me because it puts a thin, non-spraying stream in just the right place and at just the right temperature and pressure to be comfortable. That makes drying quicker. I turn the air dryer on when I'm finished washing, let it dry for a few seconds, then use a single square of tissue to finish patting dry.

My suggestion to FIRST TIMERS: Adjust both the water and air temperatures to the lowest setting, and the water pressure to the lowest intensity. It is much easier to adjust either upward as desired, than it is to quickly find the right buttons when you aren't familiar with them, and adjusting downward if it's too hot or too strong to be comfortable.

CON: Once it has been adjusted to your personal preferences, the awkwardness of reaching the controls WHILE SEATED should NOT be a problem BUT - until then it is near impossible to turn one's head sideways and look down to seat level to read and adjust the various controls to set preferences.It is a hard position to reach and hold because it is at the limit of how much most of us can twist our head and still remain seated, without getting a crick in one's neck.

It would have been fine if the controls were either nearer the front of the seat or detachable so they could be attached to the wall at eye level."
"Ever since my visit to Japan in 2013 I've been wanting an electronic toilet seat. I'd considered the similarly featured Toto washlet but couldn't see any significant difference between the two besides price. So.

I've vacillated between 3 and 4 stars for my Smart Bidet, settling on 4 because, well, there are few joys like sitting on a warm toilet seat. Every time I sit, I sigh with happiness. Sitting too long, however, isn't the most comfortable. Something about the angle, however slight, of the seat makes it uncomfortably hard on my sitting bones. It also sits really high on my toilet base. It doesn't streamline gracefully with my toilet and the logo is rather obtrusive. Paired with my Squatty Potty makes my SmartBidet toilet looks like some kind of Command Chair for Special Opoorations. Not exactly a sexy look for a one bathroom household. But all the jokes and side eyes stop as soon as my guests sit down so I don't sweat it.

The For Him-Back spray is pretty intense. If you angle it right and set the spray strong, it's almost like getting an enema. The For Her settings are pretty much For All: I assure you, no one will know which button you pick. The dryer is nice but useless, unless you're staying a while. But the warm water, the heated seat, and, unexpectedly, the soft touch open/close for the lid all makes this absolutely worth it."
"First, installation was really easy. You'll only really need a screwdriver and a wrench (for disconnecting / reconnecting the water lines). I was expecting this to be a day long affair as most seemingly simple projects end up being, but I was happily surprised that this took no more than an hour at most (including unpacking, reading, installing, and clean up).

Couple important things to remember: (1) you'll need to make sure your water line valve behind the toilet is accessible and (2) you've got an outlet somewhere (with three prongs) to plug this thing in.

As for the booty spa experience. It's divine. The jet is slightly more intense than I'd like for my sensitive bung hole (even after putting it on the most gentle setting), but I'm guessing this is just temporary since it's just such a new sensation. The heated seat and water is holy. The only reason you'll need toilet paper after this seat is just for an extra pat dry. Don't expect the built in dryer to fully dry off your parts after they've been showered / pressure washed by the bidet spray.

The only thing I don't like is that the seat does feel a little smaller than the original toilet seat. By smaller, I mean less enlongated and the seat arms a little less thick. I wish they'd make the seat thicker and longer (that's what she said)."
"After 4.5 years of pretty good use, the nozzle no longer come out.

Good temperature on water and seat, good water pressure, good almost everything, except the lifespan of 4.5 years is a little bit short.

Additional info:
4.5 years ago I bought the Sb-2000, general usage is very satisfying, except that it died at 4.5 years. I was going to buy another SB-2000 model to replace the died bidet, but then saw in the item listing that there's another version of it that can have unlimited hot water, that's how I ordered the SB-2600 as a replacement. Unfortunately the SB-2600 is a tankless bidet and has a quite low water pressure and does not fulfill the cleaning job well. According to SmartBidet tech support, this could be the reason for a weaker water pressure and there's no solution to solve the issue, he suggest me to replace the SB-2600 with a SN-2000.

I should have put this review of SB-2600 to its own review, but click the SB-2600 review button comes to this SB-2000 review, strange."
"Researched for a long time to find a bidet that would be cost effective and just work. The Smart Bidet 2000 really works well for us. Put this bidet on an elongated toilet and there is plenty of room to go.

Installation was very simple but with a few items that you will need to replace. The T-Fitting that comes with the unit is very poor quality. Cannot get wrenches in to tighten very well and just leaks like crazy. I went down to my home improvement store and bought a really good one shown in my attached pictures. Installed the hoses first and then attached to the shut off valve last. Every thing else went very smooth just following the directions. I also installed an outlet next to the toilet because it does require power.

Operation is really easy. Just turn on the water heater before sitting down and the water is warm by the time you need it. The spray can be adjusted back and forth in real time as well as soft to hard pressure. Presets give a good starting point. The blower is ok but not fast enough for me. Seat takes a minute or two to warm up so turn on early before sitting down.

Overall, really good quality seat for the money that is easy to maintain with vinegar and water. Can't go wrong with this one."
"I had never even considered using a bidet. Then I got a little intrigued by the one I saw in my father-in-law’s bathroom. I am hirsute in all the wrong places so I remembered it as we were going through COVID at first, then forgot about it. But we were going through paper so quickly I talked to my wife and I ordered this model.

Thus far, I couldn’t be more pleased! There are easy-to-follow installation instructions, and it took maybe 15 minutes to do. All parts are included. One has a choice of how far forward to install the seat; mine works best when all the way forward.

There was a little bit of a learning curve, for me. Basically, I had to how learn to wiggle my bottom back & forth so that the water washes off all involved areas, yet keep my thigh in contact with the seat’s skin sensor. If you get off that, everything shuts down - a minor annoyance.

As I learn to use it better, I anticipate saving a lot of trees lol."
"We have enjoyed this product for a couple of years, but recently the lid hinge broke. Now the lid slams down and makes a terrible grinding/clicking sound when you open it. Aside from longevity of the parts, it has been a good seat/bidet. Maybe plan on buying a new one every 2 - 3 years with this brand."
"I had same name brand for 6 years! Loved it.
This one has a control panel on the side of seat. I’m a big lady & it touches my leg. I should have read more…..didn’t realize it was a attached control bar. Not looking forward too cleaning 🤦‍♀️"
"We have 2 of these and they work great, but my one complaint is that there are 2 settings - his and hers - but the buttons don't save a memory setting. If one person wants the spray in one position and pressure and the other person wants it differently, you must adjust the spray every time rather than just selecting his or hers button."
"I finished installing this a week ago. Thankfully we had an outlet close to the toilet, so the installation and testing was easy and only took about 30 minutes. She loves it and thinks it's incredible. The normal rinse is pretty long, lasting almost 20 seconds if you don't turn it off. She loves the heated seat and water. The pressure setting on it is also great since we don't have a lot of water pressure in our house."
"It works as intended, great product for the price. An observation, you will need a toilet with a flat reservoir (the back part of the toilet, facing you where the water fills) and 5-6 inches of flat clearance from the bowl to the toilet reservoir. If your toilet does not have this amount of clearance, the toilet seat won't fit or line up correctly."
"Was really excited when I ordered the Bidet. I had an electrical socket and switch added so I would have heat. First of all they said it would fit a round toilet. IT DOES NOT FIT PROPERLY ON A ROUND TOILET. There is about 2 inches of toilet bowl under the seat left. That means when you are sitting on the seat your frontal ""part"" is up against the porcelain bowl. That is annoying to me.

The heated water I wanted either starts out cold and gets wamer or starts warm and gets cold halfway through each cycle. There are simple adjustments to make on pressure, hot water, and spray angle. They are supposed to stay the same unless you change them.

The bidet has a mind of its own and the results are different on every single usage. Sometimes the water spray is so sharp it feels like a knife. It will actually give you an enema. The sprayer always changes the angle on its own. Basically it has its own mind on what is going to happen during each use. There are some positives, but the negatives way outway them. Maybe I just got a bad unit, but who knows."
"I installed it and even rewired my bathroom for power next to the toilet. Several people tried it and all reported it did not clean even with the max pressure and using the wash several times.
The position of the controls make it difficult to use. They need some sort of tactile indicator cause you can't see them when sit-in on the thing.
The dryer is useless unless you have 10 minutes to waste.
I sent it back."
"33 year old short fat bald bearded mechanic here, I'm not exactly the stereotypical kinda person you envision using a bidet, but....... Love this thing. Very comfortable, not bulky looking on the toilet either. Even my 4 year old son can use this thing and his rear is way cleaner than him or me can wipe it with tp. This is well built and functions flawlessly.

JUST DO IT!

Save the trees!..... And the underwear"
I have had the product for just about a year and a half. I really like it and it has changed my life. Unfortunately the lid mechanism broke and the lid slams down now every time. Its just annoying enough for me to only give it a 3 star rating. For 250 bucks it should last a minimum of 2yrs before falling apart.
"This was my first use ever of a bidet and now I’m almost upset about the decades past without. I absolutely love everything about this bidet. I have a standard size round toilet, but this fit perfectly well despite being oval. I have zero plumbing or even basic handiness but was able to install this myself (big win). I have some weirdly sized pipes and this came with adapters that fit even my pipes. The only thing I needed to install this myself was a wrench and plumbers tape; everything else I needed was in the box. The instructions were very easy to follow. It’s been a few months now of using it every day and it works beautifully. Love the many different options for settings, always having a heated seat and unlimited hot water, and the self-cleaning nozzle. This has spoiled me greatly and is easily one of the best additions to my home ever."
"Easy setup, easy to function, all around great product!"
"Upgraded from the basic 2 option front and back. Biggest difference water pressure. Once you've gotten use to the water pressure of a basic bidet this one is extremely soft.
Love the warm water and seat option.
Awesome on the self cleaning.

Negative for me finding the right buttons in the dark. I hate turning on lights at night which makes using the bidet difficult. Going to put glow in the dark stickers to help."
"So I know it's a little taboo to talk about clean butts, but Charmin can do it so why not us?! (look I rhymed and didn't even try) I love this toilet seat, I've had it for about 8 months now and would never go without one! It's funny, I actually reach for the control panel no matter what toilet I'm using now and I feel a little ""less clean"" when I don't have access to it. I really love that it's got both back AND front for the ladies (ladies, we can all think of a use for that) as well as the dryer! It's kinda soft flow for the dryer and takes a minute so I don't really use it that much but if you were on a no TP kick, then it's amazing! It really does allow you to use much LESS TP than normal even without the dryer. The company even sent me a replacement lid after 8 months free of charge because mine was cracked, what great customer service!"
"Was easy to install. I had to buy a different adapter since my shut off valve had a 1/2 inch pipe thread (manufactured home). Other than that it was quick and straight forward. Bought this primarily for my wife and she is happy with it. Being this is our 1st experience with one of these type seats, we can not find anything really to complain about. It does move me a little more forward so I need to keep my appendage from touching the inside of the bowl. It closes up the toilet bowl opening to make room for the electronics. A trade off in design to make this fit different sized toilets. Mine could have moved back another inch before touching the tank. Can only move it back so far because the cleaning section will touch the back of the rim. This is not a complaint for it is well designed, built and comfortable. Does a great job at cleaning my rear and only use the toilet paper now to dry and check for any mess left. Great product."
"Update: Quit heating the water within 3 weeks. So disappointed.

I love this thing. Love the seat warmer and the water pressure. But the nozzle doesn’t come out far enough for the female wash, so I have to do some moves and gyrations to get the area done. Installation was a breeze. The hardest part was loosening the inlet valve at the wall."
"Ok, so I never fancied myself to be a bidet guy, but after working/living in parts of Asia for a few years I've changed my tune. I never realized how cold my toilet seat was until I sat on a heated one. I also never realized how much less frequently I'd need to buy paper if I pre-washed! For all you blue-collar Americans like me who aren't used to anything but the traditional paper wipe, it doesn't affect your manhood in any way. I promise."
"Just installed this yesterday and after the first use I realized it was the best purchase I will make in 2023. I have never felt more clean and relaxed while dropping a deuce.

If you care about your bootyhole at all, you will by this without hesitation.

Life changing. I'll never be able to go back to a normal toilet without feeling like a Neanderthal."
"Misses out on a 5th star due to the previously-mentioned POS tee valve included. Save yourself some time by picking up a decent bronze tee prior to installation. A pleasant surprise was that they included a new hose from valve to toilet bowl. I guess that made up for the $6 I had to spend for a decent tee. Other than the tee, a super simple installation. Bit of a hassle to reach back to use the controls and perhaps that’s a good reason to consider a uni with a remote. If you insist on using the supplied tee, remember to hand tighten and then use a wrench to turn it only 1/4 turn further. You may get lucky and then you can return the fancy brass tee. My fiancé absolutely loves the unit. She spends hours using it. Should I be worried?"
"Still in the initial learning curve of using this. But so far, my whole family loves it! Does a great job of getting you clean. It has different cleaning positions and water pressures, which are a must have. Only reason I didn't give it a 5 star, is that the water splashes outside the toilet and into the floor while cleaning. It would a nice fix, to see the manufacturer install a small plastic lip onto the bottom of the bidet seat, which covers and extends past the actual toilet bowl... To keep the water from getting through the gap between seat and toilet bowl."
"I love my bidet -the heated seat, the warm water ,the dryer ,our first one broke at the beginning of covid and so we couldn't send it in for repairs so we bought another one ,now we need to get the old one fixed for our other bathroom ,I can't understand how some people complain about it being so powerful the women's back is definitely not high pressure."
This can cause splashing .
"Liked it. Bought two more, one for the elongated toilet plus one more as a gift."
"Bought this when we moved as our Toto was for an elongated toilet, and our new place are all round toilets. Took a chance on an unknown brand and it has been great. The pressure can be adjusted, the seat stays warm. It has been a perfect toilet seat with zero problems. I am never going back to a non-bidet toilet and have recommended this one over the more expensive ones to friends and family."
"Pro: cleansing features work well
Con: Dryer is only ""partially"" dry and stopped working in 3 months!"
"I am less than 90 days of use and a button has already quit working. It is the ""forward"" button so if it only sprays in one place, it is useless and painful. I have started the warranty claim process. I will update."
This is a game changer. Reduced toilet paper use by 80%. I wish I had purchased this years ago.
"We love this seat! The warm water and warm seats are a must! It was worth hiring an electrician to put power in our master bathroom. We did this in our old house, moved, and did it all again! I don’t use any other restrooms in the house."
I've got 4 different bidet seats in my house and this one is the best. Very strong water flow and a dryer that actually works fairly quickly. No nightlight like my other bidet seats but it's not a big deal.
"This is our first bidet and we love it! My husband and I both complain now when we use other people’s bathrooms and we have to use toilet paper again. We’ll probably buy these for our parents since we visit often and TP feels like sand paper now. I also live next door to where I work and when I take bathroom breaks, I go home. Seriously. You don’t realize how icky using toilet paper is until you use start using a bidet. Our only complaints are that we wish the control panel was lit up for use at night and the dryer takes too long (I cut up flannel and fleece for drying sheets instead, so no biggie). The heated seat is wonderful! You’ll never want to sit on a cold seat again. Also the heated water is a must! I can’t imagine not getting one with heated water and then having ice cold water shoot up the backside. Yikes! The water pressure is perfect, very powerful."
I am writing a review after 6 month using this bidet. I love this smart bidet. It’s so comfortable and good quality.
"After installing this product, I had a lot of concerns so I uninstalled it just as quick. This ""elongated"" seat is correct but the hole in the seat is anything but. It is small and as a man of larger statue I could not see how this would be able to work. Things weren't lining up correctly when sitting on the seat, as I could picture a 'baby using the bathroom in a tight diaper' up the back situation happening. That fear alone had me uninstall it.

The installation was easy and the functions looked like what I wanted, but BEWARE OF THE SMALL HOLE!"
"Great quasi-portable bidet. I say 'quasi' because getting the water hooked up without leaking can be tricky. Be warned: the washers in the T-fitting that comes with the product may have fallen out during shipping. I couldn't figure out why I couldn't get it to stop leaking until I noticed one in the bottom of the box and re-installed it all. Now it works like a champ. The settings are very flexible and it works well.

My only negative comment is that it seems to suck a LOT of power. I originally had it plugged into a regular wall circuit, which turned out to be shared with the lights. I found when using the drier that my lights would flicker wildly, to the point where I imagine it could induce fits in people prone to that sort of thing. I had an electrician come out and hook up a new outlet to a new circuit in my box and now it's great."
"My sister that is disabled and has limited use of her hands got this and she is loving it. It has a seat warmer and easy to control functions at the simple push of buttons. It comes with settings for men and women and each one adjusts with the buttons as well for precise cleaning. The fan for the drying function works great and is gentle and quiet.

I lived on Spain when I was younger and never bothered to try the old school faucet bidets there! This high tech version is easy to use and totally in the 20th century compared to the old faucet style."
"This will change your entire life, I promise."
"I've been using this product for about a week so far and it's great. It fits my elongated toilet perfectly.

Pros
- water pressure/accuracy is great.
- seat warmer is awesome
- soft-closing lid/seat is great! especially for the guys.

Cons
- I know that it's a self cleaning nozzle, but wish there was a button so I can clean it myself.
- I live in an apt where I don't have access to the 5/8 in T connector it comes with , so I had to buy a different T connector for 15/16''
- The heated water is hit or miss, sometimes it's warm sometimes it's not

This isn't a con, but I did buy a filter for this product to extend the life of the bidet.
Also this doesn't have an odor control feature, which I wish it had."
"I love this bidet. It works great and has lots of features. The seat isn't intended to be soft so it's not, but I don't care. To have the water reservoir causes the seat to slant forward a bit but not bad. The plastic of the seat and lid seem to be sort of fragile and it warns to not step on either. Would I buy it again? Yes. It's nice to have warm water and that the pressure can be changed. I also love having the drier. I've had a bidet for years and replaced it with this one and am glad to have it."
same brand for 2 years but we had the same for 5 years in another house. trouble free and it's located in a rental home of ours. No issues.
"It was leaking when I installed then I bought a seal white tape and the leak problem was solved.
I really like it, however they increase the price over $200, too expensive now."
"I've been using bidet seats since they were sold out of the back of nameless warehouses to those brave enough to sit on an electrified toilet seat. I've gone through a few. This one is my favorite. Not because it was the best. Not because it does something the others didn't. This is my favorite because At this price point you usually get a seat that sprays cold water and might warm your back side If the air condition isn't set too low in the house.

The SB-2000 is quite feature packed, easy to install and well designed. If I had to come up with a complaint it would probably be the labeling. The seat has a button for the Male backside, The female backside, And the female front side. The only difference between the male and Female backside setting, as for as I can tell, is the spray. Like men don't deserve a soft spray and women never need a hard spray...

All things said the seat is well made, easy to install, and does everything it promises to do at half the price of the others. Highly recommended."
"I got this for my wife, not thinking I'd like or need a bidet thats heated. After using this its hard to use the toilet without one! I travel for work and miss the bidet at every hotel. Its super comfortable and love the heated water and seat! The only thing is the air dryer blows out all the smells from the toilet, if there was a way to have the air scented like some other bidets do that would make it better. But we love the bidet and definitely recommend!"
"After going to Japan, I knew i needed to get one back in the states. I waited 2 years before finally getting an electrician to add a GFCI outlet by the toilets.

I was looking at a few different brands and this one seemed the best for its price point.

PROS:
-The warm toilet seat is life-changing. I have 2 bathrooms and i always get reminded of how painful normal toilet seats are now.
- Warm water with oscillating feature
- comes with all components needed to install

CONS:
-The dryer gets stuck most of the time. It's not getting dirty and it's mounted correctly. It just seems like the material they have lining the edges is causing it to have too much friction so the vent flap doesn't open all the way. Now you're blowing air over your COW PIE and now your whole bathroom is a shitake suana.
-The nozzle positioning is not the best. I dont think there was enough R&D done to figure out all the different angles the water would reflect when hitting your butt. Once in awhile, the water will hit your butt, then bounce OUT of your toilet, between the seat cover and the toilet. Lowering the pressure fixed this.. but i'm trading off cleaner floors for a less clean butt.

When i reached out to customer service on their website - I never heard back. Reached out twice and nothing. I tried and apparently they dont give a sh.. so my review reflects that.

I will be going for different brand of bidet for my 2nd bathroom."
"Saw these things all over Japan and didn't want a mere hose like in Thailand, so I bought one, and plan to buy another eventually. Everyone thinks it's so cool, but it's way cooler if you actually use it all the time.
The dryer takes a while, and it's almost pointless, but everything else works great. I did notice that it started spraying a bit wider after some time, and this could be because we are on well water and don't have any filters in place. But....other than that, it's pretty much flawless.
The seat is always nice and warm, the water is warm, it has plenty of pressure, everything is adjustable, and it's super easy to use.
The price is worth it."
"I purchased this for a family member who had extensive surgery. I installed it myself and the hardest part was squeezing my body between the wall and the toilet to remove some screws and flanges. We do not have an electric outlet close to the toilet so I had to run a waterproof extension cord. The seat and remote are very easy to use and the entire system is excellent. I am going to purchase one for our second bathroom. It made post operative life for my family member so much easier. Should be a must for elderly people who have trouble with personal hygiene. I think the attached remote is better than the portable remote, for convenience. You don't have to worry about dropping the remote or putting it in a place where it is not easily accessed. The price was very good and well worth it."
"This is my second smartbidet and both devices stop working just shortly after the warranty expires, which is around 15 months. It was wonderful when it worked but the quality is just not there. I just can’t justify spending $200 every 15 months to get a new device"
"This is my second SmartBidet. I used my other one so much, it wore out after 3 years. This is a great quality bidet, with all the bells and whistles you need. The settings are great and it leaves you feeling clean! Love it! When I travel, I miss my bidet so much. Everybody should have a bidet. There is no going back!"
We have been using this bidet for 3 years now and have loved using it. At 2 1/2 years of use for a family of 6 the seat started to crack (users weight range from 50lbs to 220lbs) and shortly thereafter the seat heater stopped working and within a couple weeks the water stopped heating (it’s been a cold few months) This was our first bidet and can not live without it now. If the seat was more durable I would get another one but I am going to try an entry level Toto and hope it will last longer.
Stopped working two years after I bought it. Shorted out and popped my gfci. Nothing works now. Lights up but nothing else. Then it started working again.
This is the 2nd bidet that I bought from this company. The first one we had for about two years until it finally stopped working. The 2nd was faulty after 2 months. There was an electrical short that prevented the dryer from working eventh though the rest worked fine. I will not buy anymore products from this brand.
"Easy to install, good instalation videos on YouTube.
Fits our round toilet and has the features we were looking for."
"Thought it was all hype. I usually wet my tp but this saves a ton of time. Only need tp to dry. I did a little research and this bidet should be reliable. It has everything. Heated seat, heated water, dryer, it's accurate, good self cleaning before and after. I'm gonna get 2 more as Christmas gifts for the family. I got a back up t tap valve but didn't use it. No leaks. Recommend adjustable wrench to tighten valves. I'll update if any problems arise."
"1 star less for instructions, aligning the holes, pushing back the toilet seat to the back and a tool to tighten the bolts [not one tool worked conveniently for this task]. Bottom line, love it. We'll see if it lasts."
"When researching these, I discovered that no matter what the expense/quailty, they all stop working at some point, so it might take more sense getting a $300 seat several times rather than a $1000 seat several times, as long as it has all the features I want. I am trying the remote type in one bathroom and the attached control panel in another. Each has its advantages and disadvantages. This one is more expensive and it would be nice if the remote lit up, so I don't have to turn on the light at night. Luckily! The ""night light"" on the side of the toilet can be turned off. It was rather bright, but due to positioning not enough to read the remote, so in dim light I just have to memorize the buttons. It was relatively easy to set up and they supplied everything necessary. Although it seems to be set up for hand tightening, I needs a plumber's wrench in the end to prevent any leaking. All of the functions are nice and work well. I have used a lot of these in Asia and the ""dry"" function is always just minimal - seems normal. Oddly , it's a little well directed on this one than the other one I bought for half the price, but still works fine. I like the self cleaning of the nozzles here. So far I am quite happy with it."
"I never knew I even needed one of these but when I went to my friend's house and sat on her toilet, I wanted one. I had no idea which to choose and there are so many options, I chose the top of the line. My husband is not a plumber but he installed this without too much effort. The remote control is very easy to use and has a little stand to put next to your seat.
Good points: At night, the cool led light is not too bright and is just enough to get into the bathroom and see.
The nozzles are all stainless steel and self cleaning
Wow - the different washes! OMG, there are so many different types for different types of cleaning! It's awesome and the water is warm too!!! I feel so clean when I'm finished using it. It's good for me as a woman to feel fresh all times of the month, not just at certain times.
I also have this thing about not using public bathrooms, so I'm always rushing when I have to use one. Now, in my own home, I can take care of everything and not feel rushed and always feel clean after a busy day.

I know this is something children need and also any child with special needs. I know many parents would love to have this to help them care for them. I need to get one for my elderly relatives and anyone i know with any kind of back issues or even a little overweight. When I gained a lot of weight last year, cleaning was more difficult. It makes life so much easier. I'm not the penny pincher type, but i do think i will save money on toilet paper. Especially since my husband is borderline IBS, and uses a lot of toilet paper. He doesn't need to use as much.
I highly recommend! It has changed my life in a small way but it's everyday that i benefit from it!!!"
"Just as I was ready to go to the big box store and buy another load of 8,000 rolls of toilet paper our neighbor said she had a toilet seat bidet and she loved it. After some research and discussion my wife and I decided on the SB-3000. Game changer. This model uses instant warm water to assure no cold shocks and has a sleek design. The price is more than some models but for me the the features, comfort and ease of use was worth it. And an item like this is something you don't want to skimp on. Installation took less than an hour after I figured out the drawings. The adjustment features took a few minutes, there is a learning curve, but I got the seat warmer to be exceptionally comfortable. The squirting mechanism is an easy button to operate and the drying feature works great as well. I won't go into detail of the cleansing process. You sit down, do what you came for, get clean and your done. No muss, no fuss, no toilet paper and a comfortable and pleasant experience. My wife loves it."
It was easy to install. The quality is good. 1. The air dryer is too hot in the low mode and doesn't dry. 2. The seat get hot more in the left side and is too hot as well. 3. The deodorant do not work .
"We did a lot of research, and compared it to lots others... but there was just one summary solution left: This one here!
GET IT AND YOU WON'T REGRET IT!!
We are EXTREMELY pleased with this SmartBidet SB-3000, it works like a charm and is very entertaining* - not to forget the easy installation, and the extremely good cleaning process everywhere ""down there""! In Addition we save over 80% toilet paper - WOW! The package was very sturdy, and survived even the transport to Hawai'i without problems - there is everything packed inside you'll need... sadly we could just submit 5 STARS! THANK YOU SO MUCH!

* with a backlit remote and a Bluetooth option with built-in speakers in this seat (or a link to our home stereo system) we would never leave our restroom again... hahaha"
"“Feminine” alignment of the sprayer is not great, only an inch more forward from the “rear” sprayer alignment… which is not anatomically correct at all. Even with the forward direction adjustment of the water spray which adjusts it more anterior, I still have to sit like I am trying to hover way back on the toilet seat. This was one of the major buying points besides the child setting. Disappointed and may look for another bidet with better settings for it.
Husband said the regular “rear” setting for him once, another time it had to be on “turbo” to do the job. He is very happy with it and loves not having to take a shower after a BM or walk around feeling gross all day."
"This is one of the best purchase in recent years. I recently gave a birth where my doctor recommended me a bidet for a postpartum care. I did extensive research and decided to give it a try on SmartBidet SB-3000.

Installation was so easy, took me about 20 mins where I did not need much help from instruction because it was so intuitive and simple. No need for extra tools except screw drive. Size was perfect to my existing toilet and did not take any extra space which I was worried about since my bathroom is so small.

After two weeks of usage, I do not use any of other toilets although we have three other toilets in the house. Seats have sensors where it actives heat when you sit on. It's gotten cold in the east coast and no better feeling than sitting on the warm toilet in the morning visit. The remote comes in really handy. It has a sticker mount that it does not damage your wall. It has LCD screen which is one of the reason I purchased this product. It provides status of time, pressure and options which really comes in handy. Most of functions are modifiable including pressure, temperature and time. There also is a night light where I do not need to turn on the bathroom light in the middle of the night.

Now the best part. The spray is adjustable where it hits the sweet spot. I set it up to be in the mid-pressure for 2 mins with mid-temperature water, although I would think about 30 secs would do the job. The feeling of cleanness and freshness is exceeding my expectation. I leaves no residuals and itchiness.

My six year old is also a fan of this bidet. I do not have to clean her up anymore in most cases.

This bidet creates not much of noise or water running clicks which tells me this is well made product. I would recommend it to anyone who uses conventional toilet which I will never do back to!

Only issue is that all of my family wants to use this bidet so we may need to install more..."
"I have purchased several of the 'market leading' seats.... I thought I would try this one for a change - second home second bathroom. Easy unpack, good instructions, simple to use. Fittings and and setup were as expected - high quality seat mount with very flexible bolt positions - base plate for quick install/release a clean fit. All the parts needed were present - water hoses, connectors easy to fit.
The seat heated well, water was warm as expected, and remote worked seamlessly - price was good too...."
"I own 4 Toto seats, one of the best inventions of mankind in my opinion. Once this ""pandemic"" hit, others soon figured out wiping with paper is not the best idea. Once toilet paper sold out, the Toto's soon followed suit. I happened to buy another residence and step one was installing a bidet seat of some sort. Lead time on Toto was 2-4 months, totally unacceptable for me. So my search brings up this seat, has most of same features plus a night light, cost about $50 more, but I was not waiting 4 months for a seat.
Easy enough installation, much like Toto. However the seat warmer does not stay engaged 24/7 ready for duty as the Toto does. Once washdown commences, it only gives you a 2:30 timer, not unlimited as Toto. Now I have to hit the button twice to get at least 5 minutes. Oscillating feature takes about 6-7 times of hitting the button, a defect I think on the remote. Drying is fine. The light is nice for night time drains, but not worth $50. Stick with Toto if you can, but this will work in a pinch!"
"I was on the fence about a new electronic bidet, as cold water in the bum isn't my favorite. But the SB-3000 has heated water, heated seat and heated dry, and I now actually look forward to using it. Definitely recommend."
"My husband and I were lucky enough to make a trip to Japan recently and we were impressed with the high tech toilets in Japan. We couldn’t stop thinking about them once we were home so I decided to purchase one for us . I was so excited about that I was telling my family about our purchase and they were basically underwhelmed. That Is until they had a chance to come try it out for themselves and they were as blown away as we are. If you order this you will need to have a GFI outlet near the toilet in order to operate it. We did not but we were able to wire one into the existing bathroom. I love the heated seat and the clean feeling that the bidet can give you. In case you were wondering, the water is heated so no cold shock of water being sprayed on you. It has a remote control and it’s pretty easy to figure out how it all works. It’s one of those things you may never have known you wanted until you have a chance to try it like we did, and now that we have it, we love it!"
"Life changing

I miss it while traveling"
"I have been using this product for over 2 years.
Last week I lost the rubber seal while cleaning the nozzle.
After sending an e-mail to Customer Service, I got a reply that they will send the parts to the complementary with UPS Tracking No within an hour. I used a bidet for 10 years and tried many other products, but I was most satisfied with this product, and I found that it was perfect for customer care too.
Thank you for a good product and great consumer care."
"Just got it installed as we were waiting for a plug.
Pros:
It was easy to install and hookup up.
Heated seat is nice

Cons:
Water pressure isn’t great, we had an attachment previously and it cleaned better overall. This one will clean you just takes a little longer.
Feminine wash doesn’t hit right.
Dryer not great, but feels nice.
Hole is fairly small even in elongated toilet.
Water could be warmer.
Just overall doesn’t feel worth what I paid. Thinking of returning it."
"It's amazing. Not only you can save toilet paper, it feels cleaner. Having clean and dry behind is much greater feeling than I initially anticipated before owning a bidet. I had different brand for 6 years and decided to try this unit after water is not pumping and the motor started to make annoying sound.

Compared to the other model, SmartBidet is much quiter and easier to install. It took me about 10 minutes and I have not much experience with tools. All you need is screw driver and wrench.

Key features I liked:

water temperature control
Seat temperature control
Skin sensor
Child wash function
Remote control (this is good for who has children or is handicapped)

Use it feel it. You won't regret your decision."
Bidet is comfortable and has worked great for almost 3 years. It has a lot of features that I really enjoy and don’t think I would ever go back to no bidet. I have recommended to all my friends and family
"wow! I got this one because if you ever go to S. Korea nearly all hotels have these as standard. So they probably know how to make a well designed one, and I was right! Once you set the heat controls to your liking (I run full heat) and give it a few hours to warm everything up, your rear will never have to sit on a cold seat again and you won't ever experience a cold water blast. The remote is simple to understand and very functional. two thumbs (rears?) way up!"
"Excellent product, excellent customer service you couldn't ask for a better. They are replacing my whole toilet rather than just send the part that was defective. They stayed with me all the way through very kind very comforting personality and I think everybody should own a smart bidet!

Update:

I just received a replacement smart bidet toilet. I must say this is the best customer service I've ever had. If you want to buy a good product without a lot of hassle, this is the place to go"
This is a must have. I checked and read reviews till the cows csme home. I found this one to be the best price for the money. It works great!!!! You pay thevprice but how much money do you pay not to have urinary tract infections any more? I had this happening and it made them not happen. I stay clean all the time. Im getting another for our front bathroom soon. Run out and get this. You wont be sorry. As a woman it keeps you clean!
"SB-3000 After you use it the first time you'll wonder why you didn't get it sooner. It'll make you feel so clean you won't want to use a regular toilet again. Installation was easy, everything needed was included in the box."
"Been working properly since we got it. Occasionally gets hung - need to power cycle - when we have power fluctuations or brownouts. I don’t consider this a defect, but a fact of rural life. Overall still very happy with the purchase."
"UPDATE:
I had something go wrong with the remote.
I called their support number and a very kind gentleman helped me, and they immediately sent out a new remote.
That speaks volumes to me, they really are great to work with, and they care about their product.
If I had the money, I would buy another one!!!

It works great, and looks nice in my bathroom.
I highly recommend this bidet."
"Play Video
 This SmartBidet is really great and I’m excited to show it off to our guests. Heated seat is always my favorite but the large remote with the screen is even better. It counts down for you. I’m a hairy guy so I needed some washing down there and this does the trick and it dries. I would recommend this."
"Product support was great, a problem with remote not working properly was fixed right away.

Then the water would not heat, a replacement was sent at no cost to me and as of Nov 25 2020 it has been working perfect.

Should have bought it years ago."
Customer service great.. great water pressure and features...a little on the pricey side but you get what you pay for. Installation took me awhile.. Warranty is great just don't open actual bidet because it will cancel out your warranty.
"Excellent product for the money. This bidet was an easy install, instructions were somewhat intuitive.
This bidet has one of the longer power cords, which is a plus. We have had this product for 3 months, and it works very well."
Works excellent and easy to install. So many options so worth paying the extra price for this model. Only complaint I have is the remote can be finicky but other than that this is the best item we have bought in a long time.
Shoot water at your starfish and blow dry your rear when you are done! This thing works great especially if you need some assistance getting out your morning loaf with the TURBO button.
This unit has the best combination of features and price. After purchase I had several questions on usage and I received quick and complete responses from the manufacturer. Have used this for a couple of months and could never do without it again. Spoil yourself!
product opening smaller than expected. controls not intuitive. night light should be inside bowl
Great friendly customer service and a totally new way of life. My body has never been so obviously thankful!
"Update: Have been using this for 3 years now.
I just bought another identical one for another toilet.
A repeat buy says more than any words can."
Had to power cycle unit as it would just stop working on occasion. After unplugging and replugging the unit it worked fine again.
"Exactly the same as biobidet bliss bb2000 but $200 cheaper. Excellent quality, easy install, high end features. What more can your butt ask for? Lovr this thing!"
"Purchased November 2019 for $529.00. Honestly it worked great until it stopped working all together July 2022. Hefty price for less than three years in operation. Only two people in our family. One man and one woman. So seriously…. Not a lot of use in three years.

We won’t be buying this one again."
"Much higher cost performance than Toto, all functionalities run well, strongly recommend!"
"Ok to start with the item says endless warm water and which isn’t true it fluctuateS and temperature the remote is terrible to use. The dryer on it for one doesn’t dry hardly at all and on top of that it blows only on the left side cheek which can be very hot. We have a $50 one that works better seriously. Not worth the money. So on top of that it has a adhesive mount for the remote that of course when you have to remove it, it pulls the paint off the wall."
"Excellent product, and outstanding customer service."
Esto no seca rápido ocupas estas 10 minutos para que seque
It is very useful when sometimes you have constipation.
Works great. No problems whatsoever.
Excellent product for aging adult
Wife loves it
Exactly what I wanted
"way over priced compared to other bidets I have
had to use other hardware to install on my toilet
not a good bidet"
"I purchased my SB-3000 through a 2nd party on Amazon, and being 40 plus years old and on the bigger side I was skeptical about this thing, I have NEVER used one in my life. The Unit was shipped fast and packaged well , and was very simple to install. It comes with a new main hose from the water inlet to the toilet , plus a adapter if you need it, so have no fear if you are worried about needing that.
comes with a T adapter and hose to the bidet plus to the toilet tank, plus the rest of the hardware to install.
Needless to say, it took me about 30 minutes to install and cleanup.
Keep in mind I have never used one , The seat can be toasty warm , the water can be cold through hot the spray is gentle to enema :-) The blow dryer I think has 5 different heat settings and it get HOT ..
Everything about this system is very fluid, simple, elegant, more controls then you can imagine, easy to use.
The only CON: is there is no user settings. YOu sit and drive it lol but hey the way it positions your privates not really a need to have your own private settings.

last but not least, For the money and the warranty and how wonderful this product is .. Don't wait and waste your times with the others, this bidet is great for all size of people, unlike EVERY OTHER ONE , plus has the most powerful stream on the market, I dont know why I didn't try this earlier in life, not a sheet of teepee used yet"
"I purchased this air drying bidet following a total hip replacement to help with keeping things clean and eliminating the need to stand up and wipe. I chose smart bidet because of the extending nozzle thinking it would clear my commode. First off your butt needs to make physical contact with the seat for operation of the bidet features. So that alone made the purchase pointless. The seat is not raised enough for posterior total hip replacement Patients to make use of it. The only way it would work is if your actual toilet was rather high off the ground which most aren’t. Beyond that, the cleaning instructions in the manual do not work. It says to hold posterior wash button for 3 seconds and that does not extend the nozzle for cleaning access. Overall I’m really disappointed in it. Smart Bidet’s website even says its great for post operative recovery going as far to specifically list hip surgery. Others that have used it said it works great, but I did not need to drop over a half a grand for a unit with a long extending nozzle and drying feature. If you have restrictions and buy this unit thinking it will work with a commode, or on its own you’ll be disappointed. Unfortunately I did not save my box and was unable to return the unit after finding out I couldn’t benefit from it.

Edit: after contacting smart bidet directly through email, they provided instructions to hold the “stop” button form for 3 -7 seconds to extend the nozzle for cleaning (different from directions listed in the manual) and even those instructions do not work. They suggested replacing the batteries in my remote. The batteries are brand new. The unit is about 3 weeks brand new, has full battery indicator on the remote. It is comically bad at how unaware this company is about their own product and how to operate it. At a list price of $600 now they should be fully aware and capable of giving maintenance instructions. Alternately they referred me to a YouTube video of a guy pulling the nozzle out with a screw driver. Their instructions thus far have been incorrect. Why would I believe these would be any different? How do I know that wouldn’t break the motor and void the warranty at the same time? The lid says to not open or repair it on my own. So as it is I’m reliant on the self clean features and have to hope no actual dirt builds up on the bidet nozzle. I will continue to reach out to customer service until they give me a satisfactory response. Honestly I suspect I will not be getting one, being unable to return it as the nature of the product, and even if I did get authorization to return it, I wouldn’t be able to return it in the window because I’m unable to drive due to recent surgery, and covid19 resulting in altered business practices and hours. It’s a $550 mess. The next bidet I buy will be at least half of the price, probably even less expensive."
"I purchased this as a Christmas present for my husband in 2019. We both agree we cannot live without a bidet now. Love the remote and nightlight features on this model. The water stays warm in the reservoir, and install was easy. It's also great if you're postpartum; tye feminine water feature is great for that. Highly recommend this bidet. Customer Service is also wonderful."
"This bidet works like a champ! My wife purchased the SB-3000 in August 2020 but for whatever reason beyond the normal maintenance, it stopped functioning. On 3/8/2011 I called the manufacturer customer support 800#, explained my problem and 2 days later received a brand new SB-3000 (no cost). Hooked it up the next day and we’re good to go! I can’t say enough good about this company backing their product, to keep its customers happy!"
"I really like this SB 3000 Smart Bidet.
Sitting on a warm seat is very soothing. But that’s just the beginning!
My long bouts on the old seat are a thing of the past!
The bonus is you get clean and dry afterwards. It’s like magic!
The customer service is great. What else can you ask?"
"My wife was going it for rotator cuff surgery on her right and she is right handed. That means double trouble. I’m retired now but I used to travel to Japan about 6 to 8 times a year and my stays were about 6 to 14 days each time.

What does this have to do about this review, A lot. I was acquainted with the bidets but avoided them because of build in American reluctance to have my butt cleaned by a machine. On one of my last trips I thought I should at least try it out and found that it was not as bad as I thought it would be.

Now roll ahead about 10 years to the present. In preparation for the surgery I asked my wife (not in the most delegate manner) how was she going to wipe herself. After the flames had died down and I had somewhat recovered from the scorching I was sure this was an issue that while dangerous needed to be addressed further. She was totally against the bidet for some reason not sure what but was not going to ask. I realized I did not have enough unburned flesh on me to survive another blow torching. Through my bring up the issue she did realize there was an issue that needed to be addressed. She spent some time with me and she came up with this other way around it and I purchase it for $45. When it came and she tried it she realized that she needed two hands to operate it.

That left the only other option the dreaded bidet toilet seat. I researched for about a day and found the one to purchase and was about to push the purchase button when I realize the controls were attached to the seat and were on the right side. This would not work as that was going to be her surgery side.

Now for the real review I choose the SmarBidet with the hand controls. It is great we both agree it does a wonderful job in fact I’m looking at installing one in our other bathroom. It save a ton of toilet paper make you feel clean and while it is not a good as the toilet bidet they have in Japan it is a wonderful product. Once you get over your dislike of the idea of a machine cleaning your butt you will wonder why you did not purchase and install one earlier.

Everything you need including a new hose is provided. It is easy to install but you will most likely have to install a new electric outlet. If you do make sure you know how and it is down low toward the floor. Installing it low will make it a better looking installation."
"Bought this several months ago when you couldn't get TP... have been using it steadily since.
1. installation is a royal pain, but much of that was getting the old seat off, having an electrical outlet installed by an electrician, etc. My part of the job took two hours. Instructions are pretty good, most of my trouble was reaching awkward bolts and contorting myself into my closet-style ""throne room"" to reach under and torque the old bolts off. USE TEFLON TAPE TO SEAL THE THREADS. NO EXCEPTIONS.
2. the device itself works a treat. no complaints. the dry cycle is slow, but I don't run it at full heat as that is like having a hot hair dryer pointed at your sensitive bits. the turbo mode will... go inside you. prepare yourself. very handy when your ...er... pipes are clogged.
3. the heated seat is SO good!
4. the deodorizer is ok but prepare to have a fan on because there is only so much it can do with limited airflow
5. the water jet is great in 3/4 (posterior, turbo, oscillate) modes (I can't comment on the 4th mode (feminine) because I haven't got the right ""equipment""...)
6. the remote is fairly intuitive but for the life of me I can't set the clock... the nightlight on the device is bright enough to find your way to the toilet but NOT bright enough to see the remote, not a big deal unless you just love relieving yourself in the dark
7. if you haven't ever used one before, be forewarned that the first usage is going to be pretty unsettling. you get used to it and it's great, but it's definitely a new sensation."
"I don’t mean to make light of the pandemic, but we got this product due to the ridiculous COVID-19-induced panic-buying TP shortages. It is awesome. Easy to install (although instructions were erroneous on where to install the T valve). I feel cleaner, and it is now comfortable after a brief period of adjustment. The features are neat and my kids even like to use it. It is made of some flimsy-seeming plastic, but I hope it will hold up. My rump is quite pleased."
"I had a SmartBidet 3000 in my condo, but left it for my renters when I moved. I love it so much I had to get another one for myself at my new place.

I'm pretty picky about my bidets and I think this is one of the best. Lots of great features and the turbo feature actually works (helps with constipation). Good water pressure helps but even so so pressure will work with this seat.

Hint...if the remote isn't talking to the toilet seat, point the remote directly at the left side of the toilet. My new one wasn't working and I thought it was a faulty remote but turns out I just need to point it directly at the buttons on the seat. Customer service has a horrible email system if you have a problem...just initiate all emails through their website so they'll get it."
"Really enjoy the machine. It fit our toilet beautifully. Both my wife and I feel healthier and cleaner. The remote has a very effective magnetic wall mount. The three wash modes plus the undulation in posterior wash with temp, pressure, and position adjustment are easy to understand and set, Easy to clean the sprayer head. The dryer mode is vary nice to always stay fresh and dry. As soon as I sit down the filter fan goes on which is a blessing for a guy married to very scent sensitive wife. Great purchase!!"
"We have purchased a SB3000 for our own use and I have recommended the Smart Bidets to my customers as well. Having one of them is just a very nice thing and I don't want to miss it anymore. We love it and my customers do too. The customer service is very helpful when it came to an unexpected warranty claim and they dealt with us as we were direct customers, even though we purchased it through Amazon and we are from Canada.
We will keep recommending this brand and model in the future - for sure!"
"Japan, bar none, has the best toilets in the world and I saw Toto bidet toilets everywhere during a month in Japan.

After I returned to the U.S. I felt rather uncivilized. I do not have a separate wet room just for bathing where there's a drain in the floor and I can wash down and scrub everything, including the walls, with the shower hose. And the toilet wasn't a separate room where I had designated slippers only to be used there.

This was a lot cheaper than remodeling my bathroom. It was easy to install, affordable and works almost as well as the ones I used in Japan although this is just the lid rather than the entire set up.

You can set the water pressure, temp and adjust the angle of the spray. And because it's Toto, a Japanese company that has been making electronic Washlets since 1980.

The Washlet is well designed to be easy to clean and to be sanitary. The water wand retracts fully.

The only thing missing from the Washlets I experienced in Japan was the music for privacy.

And I will no longer fear the next toilet paper shortage.

The cost of converting my bathroom to a"
"Pretty easy installation for my 84 year old crafty husband. And a life changing product for me! I have the usual issues of a 70 year old female, I guess. This is such a nice, clean way to deal with elimination issues. I got the base model I guess but it’s still luxurious to me! Highly recommend for all ladies."
Great bidet and easy install Controls are on right side and all work as stated Seat is easy to keep clean and would buy again They do have a model with remote which is also a great option
"Very comfortable. Works very well, as supposed to. It was not difficult to install. I prefer the option without a remote. Highly recommend!"
Excellent product and value
"Have you ever felt like wiping yourself clean with just paper isn't enough? Let's be honest, if any of your business touched your finger, would you just wipe it clean with toilet paper and call it a day? This toilet seat is a game changer. It's toasty warm and leaves you feeling like you practically just showered. And who can say that they haven't had a day where it feels like they have to go through a whole roll of toilet paper just to feel clean after sitting down and finding yourself in a....sticky situation? Problem. Solved.

This seat works best with an elongated toilet, but we were easily able to install it on our round toilet with no issues. My only complaint is that we only have one and I have to walk upstairs every time I potty just so I can use my now favorite toilet seat."
"This is the second installation of a TOTO WASHLET A2 Electronic Bidet Toilet Seat with Heated Seat and SoftClose Lid. We have two toilets, one upstairs and one on the main floor. For some reason, we had neglected to install a second Electronic Bidet Toilet Seat. Part of the problem is that many households do not have a power receptacle close enough to the toilet to allow for simple installation and connection to power. The plumbing connection and seat placement are dead-easy requiring only a Phillips screwdriver and an adjustable wrench. After that, I was able to drop a cable inside the wall from the existing ground-fault protected receptacle up by the sink down to a junction box with cover. I then ran a 2-wire with ground BX cable along the floor from the junction box inside the vanity to the side of the cabinet closest to the toilet where I installed a box with receptacle. This allowed me to plug in the toilet power plug. Everything worked as planned and the new Bidet Toilet Seat with Heated Seat is a welcome comfort for all users. The seat is fully programmable for seat and water temperature. Water temperature and intensity can also be adjusted to suit the user."
Whats not to love? Having a clean bottom changes your life.
"GREAT Bidet! Easy to install and every works BUT it kinda pushes you forward a lil bit when you sit on it to do your business due to the prongs that is needed to installed it for the seat to clip onto. SO, if you don't mind being pushed forward while sitting on it, it's a great product. TOTO is the oldest bidet brand in Japan.."
Works ok
"I had an advance washlet, and needed a basic one. This one is basic but it does what it suppose to do , wash, heat up your seat, just without blow dryer , so it's good!!"
Does the job well. Welker how the water is room temp so not a shock when using. So far very happybwith this product.
"While traveling in South Korea it was easy to become spoiled with all the bidets in hotels and many public restrooms. Upon returning home I purchased another brand and was disappointed by problems arising from an overall poor design. In contrast, the Toto Washlet has been nothing short of a revelation. It is simple, efficient, and well-made. I'm glad I bought this product!"
"Love it. My first bidet, but love the warm seat and warm water. Feels very refreshing. My friend who bought a different brand has a quick cold water on first spray which to me sounds puckering and uncomfortable. I’ve tried the ones with the air dryer but still had to use toilet paper to dry even after like 2 minutes which feels like a long time. So I think this one is perfect in having everything that you need and nothing that you don’t."
"Took me about 20 minutes to install... It was my first time.

This one does not have air drying, music, lelight shows or automatic lift, which is bummer. But it's a perfect my first bidet.

If I could do it again, I would make sure the dimensions are correct, my 1990's toilet is not as pointy, the round nose one would have fit a little better."
Great we love
"First off, let me say that we are familiar with Toto washlets, my parents have 2 and I’ve used them quite a bit.

We bought this washlet when renovating our bathroom. Once the bathroom was complete (2 months after purchase) we immediately installed it. While doing the test run to make sure all features worked, it immediately didn’t work. The wand was stuck out and would not retract. Immediately I contacted Toto support who said “I wish you would have opened it sooner in the 30 day window so Amazon could exchange it”. It was 2 months after purchase, and immediately didn’t work upon opening- a manufacturer’s issue- Toto themselves (who is the manufacturer) could have easily sent us a new one, but instead told us now it is a warranty repair and I would need to ship it to them to repair and then they would send it back. I had to file a claim, they sent me packaging instructions, but not label. I asked for a label from the same support agent for 4 days before receiving a label with no response from the agent.

We shipped it back. Never received confirmation or any info regarding the repair. About 2 weeks later it shows up at our house with no information except a checklist sheet with a tech signature.

We installed it again. And the wand is working (for now). But we are immediately noticing the warm water feature only stays warm for about a minute and then goes cold. I called tech support - since this model and listing states it has warm water- and they inform me that this model only has warm water for 1 minute and then it goes cold. If we want constant warm water, we need to purchase a more expensive model.

Not happy with this purchase and Toto support."
The second one purchased ... great.
needs to be said. Just buy it.
"This is my second time ordering a TOTO WASHLET. The first I left at my parents’ home when I moved away. My friends think I’m crazy recommending a bidet to them… but it is totally a life changer. No more cold toilet seat. Saves so much toilet paper while also getting you much cleaner! I am far from a handy person and had no issues installing either unit.

The remote is attached so no worries about losing it. You can control the nozzle position, water pressure, seat temperature, and water temperature to your preference. The wand retracts when not in use so no worries about a messy situation there. The toilet seat is soft closing. If you’re on the fence, go for it!

Keep in mind that the version I ordered is oblong. Your bowl may be round. Take measurements to ensure the unit will fit your commode. The only drawback is the power cord is short and my bathroom doesn’t have a bidet outlet. I had to purchase an extension cord to reach the nearest outlet."
"Have wanted one of these for some time. Beneficial as one gets older. There are other brands, but Toto is a leader in this kind of product. Installation was easy and the product works as designed. Delivery was directly from Toto, but when the product was delivered, it was missing a side cover. Dealing with Toto customer service has been a big hassle. They required the purchase receipt, model number, photo of the shipping box, and photo of the missing cover area. Then three weeks with no response. I contacted them again and over a week later was finally sent the wrong part. I sent an email back to their customer service, and again no response. As the most expensive brand in the market, Toto needs to back up the cost with better customer service."
"Install was easy, but a few snags. Not having an air dry doesn't seem to be an issue. Wish we had gotten one sooner. A remote would have been better as the arm controls are farther back and require twisting around. to adjust the temp. Install tip: Our toilets have small bolt holes and the long black nut didn't easily go though even with some water as lube. I ran one of the long bolts up from the bottom and into the nut and pulled it down. I did have to adjust the mounting plate one notch away from center so the seat was even with the bowl rim front. The mounting plate is adjustable, but in steps. I suggest only snugging the bolts and checking the position before tightening completely."
I have a one piece toilet and it was not possible to fit the seat because of how the water tank curves into the toilet seat area. Be aware that the square fitting needs to fit flush unto the toilet. My plumber was not able to fit it but luckily we have another bathroom with a 2 piece toilet where we fitted the toilet seat instead. I had to lower to 3 stars given that there is a distinct odor coming from the bidet that hasn't gone away.
"Works great with easy controls. A definite winner. I love the convenience and how clean it makes you feel.
I have one in the two main bathrooms in my home. Easy install"
Works great and was easy to install. High quality product.
"Perfect bidet. This is my second Toto brand bidet. I had Panasonic and Toshiba bide from Japan and each lasted over 15 years and started leaking from the hose. I only trusted Japanese companies for electric bidet. Toto is the pioneer company for electric bidet.
When I installed it, it worked perfectly. Normally I had to adjust the hose and connectors with Teflon tape etc, but this time with Toto bidet, there was nothing to adjust, and works perfect. I am so happy."
I should have buy Toto befor. some other copy one is no good.
"The item is great, purchased before. But it got lost and now I don’t have a Christmas gift for my parents. I’m also unable to request a replacement because they are asking me to return the old one. (Nothing to return because I never received it.)"
"it is a beautifully designed, very easy to install. It takes me about 15 min to complete installation. Works great!"
Awesome product
Easy to install and use
"Stainless steel bolts and plates made this a joy to install, and snap into place. Water fitting worked well, and it was very tight quarters with my particular toilet. Big reduction in toilet paper, and really enjou the heated seat now that its winter"
Rides like a champ.
Very sanitary and no paper required
Love this thing!
"I am an architect, and whenever possible I spec Toto toilets, and bidet seats."
"The written description indicates there is a blower, but the product comparison makes this clear, there is not. Hence the lower price."
We are using for more than a month and it is great!
I tried one of these at a high end hotel in SFO and ordered this entry level version right away. I installed it myself after watching a you tube video. You need electricity by your toilet. Warm seat and warm water...😌 It works really well and we love it! Every toilet should have one!
"Everything functions well, but I miss the water jetting power my old one had."
"Originally showed in stock but slow shipping. Took 2 weeks for the item to arrive.
Product is as expected, easy installation."
"I waited a bit too long to install this so I'm stuck with it. However, I will not be using it. It looks absolutely ridiculous in my bathroom. I would only recommend this if you don't care what your bathroom looks like as all of the functionality seems to work. It was a super easy install. Took me about 10 minutes."
TOTO products have never failed me. This is the 3rd. one I bought.
"This product replaced an earlier high end model from Toto that lasted 9 years. This is significantly cheapened in quality and size, the opening is tiny compared to others. I highly recommend the Brondell line which I have elsewhere, much more comfortable and well made. I won't send this back since already installed but I won't buy another Toto version of these. If you haven't had a bidet toilet seat you're missing out either way 😉"
Took me a couple tries to figure out best methods but I've got it all figured out now. The seating is comfortable and the aim on this thing is deadly accurate so be prepared LoL
"Great product, well built, functional, Japanese quality design and functionality!"
Water pressure is enough. Water temperature is getting colder during using but acceptable. It was easy assembled no problem happened to set up including water pipe.
just perfect we want
I’ve gotten great deals buying “like new” returns but I’ve also gotten some bad ones. This was poorly packaged and looked like it may have previously been installed. Yuck! It certainly looked like it had been through some rough treatment. It was very scratched up and had no original packaging. So much for like new.
"Get it, it will change your life. I love it as much as I do my husband. Lolz 😂"
Low pressure. Fan sucks.
I have purchased three of these since 2019 and this new model is really “dumbed“ down. It lacks several of the features my others have (choices in pressure and location of jet stream) yet cost about $100 more.
It will be much helpful if provide detail info how to buy matching toilet base
Excellent
Very bulky for Toto
"This was difficult to install. We ended up having a plumber come to install it, which was a significant added expense. Even after it was installed, the wand did not spray properly, and instead, just leaked out the sides. There is no clear guidance to be found online, so I will have to ask the plumber to come back and troubleshoot. I've now wasted lots of money and time on this defective product. I would strongly recommend against buying this product."
I need to reture it
"We spent hours installing and trouble shooting this item. The seat warmer works and the buttons light up, and water spews out so we installed it correctly. BUT the wand is stuck and won't come out! Water just drips out from the opening since the wand won't extend. There's pretty much no resource online either. What a waste of time installing and uninstalling this item."
I will not do business with Toto. This seat has never worked. They won’t refund my money. Toto is a rip off.
This seat was going to be too big too uncomfortable. The set up was so confusing
""
"Hey Toto, maybe you should reconsider making toilets that hide all the plumbing, making this completely impossible to install. OR maybe you can make a variety of hardware available for people who want to hook this to the other side of the supply line. Just a thought."
"You cannot sit on the lid. I didn't even try. But just leaning back on the lid while it was in the up position caused it to crack in the corner. It poke my skin--very uncomfortable, so I bought a new one. THIS HAPPENED THREE TIMES! I tried repairing it with a glue gun and various glues, without success.

Toto should reinforce the base of the lid. Also they should make it with a much stronger type of plastic, like polypropoline. And they should totally redesign it so that you can sit on it."
"What a blast to Uranus! This bidet gets the job done, no more Poo!"
"Super easy to install in about 30 minutes. Although I already installed a outlet with GFCI behind my toilet when I did a remodel two years ago. This is my second one. The first one is in CA house and been using for about 15 years. Just had to have one in Texas house too.
These are everywhere in Japan. Not sure why they haven't caught on in USA but it is so nice just to ""dry"" yourself with toilet paper instead of trying to clean yourself. The comfort of a heated seat in winter plus heated water is really nice. Only issue is most USA houses don't have a convenient outlet in the bathroom. In CA I used an extension cord until I installed an outlet behind the toilet."
"I love this bidet. Heated seat (which I thought would be weird but it's pretty nice on a cold night), easy to use remote (although, I wish it would light up for night use), very easy installation, air filter system works fantastic (you do need to occasionally clean a filter but it's really easy). On the remote, you can 'program' two different settings for two different users and access those settings with the push of one button. It has a pulsating, back and forth feature that is nice and a self cleaning feature that kicks in at the end. This is the second Washlet 2 I've purchased for a second bathroom. I recommend this seat, although I've only been using it for a short time so I'm not sure on the longevity of this product. Toto is a good name in the normal toilet world, so I'm hoping their quality remains the same with this bidet. Enjoy!! You will!!"
Can't ask for more from an add on to my daily routine. My husband installed it after he ran electricity to the toilet area and it worked perfectly from moment one! Love it!
I own two of these for the last five years and bought this one as a gift for my Daughter and Son-in-Law. I love visiting them more now than ever before. I think they like it too.
Never go back to the life w/o Toto washlet.
"Control is with seat, not remote."
Very easy to install. Functionalities are enough and the price is nice.
The wife swears by it. Had to get one for the mother-in-law too.
I love how simple it is to install this product and it has been consistently effective. Love the brand and design.
"You can't go wrong with TOTO's products. Personally, I like Toshiba products, but they are not available in the US.
I don't think there is a need for a power saving mode. Using this makes it uncomfortable.
Installation is extremely easy. However, I had a hard time cutting off the bolts on the old toilet seat cover, which were stuck with rust. I don't know the wisdom of home builders using rust-prone metals in this area. They probably don't know what happened after the sale. I always think that something other than metal should be used because it is a place that will inevitably rust and stick due to humidity for many years.
Some reviewers have said that 30 seconds of hot water is not enough, but it's enough for me, a Japanese person.
In the first place, these products are intended to keep the area clean by washing the area around the buttocks hole with warm water after thoroughly wiping off feces with paper. Therefore, it is impossible not to use paper by using a washing toilet seat."
Es un aditamento muy cómodo y práctico. Higiene y confort.
 The only thing is it's a little longer than my toilet. But can still work fine.
Very good
"Bought three of these for all our washrooms and they've been great. No complaints, highly recommend. Easy to install."
👍
Une maison de campagne avec des fêtes et des gens plus âgés
The body detector of this model has a fundamental design flaw. Buy the newer model
"I enjoyed using them on a regular basis when I lived in Japan (the ones in Japan usually come with a button that made toilet flushing sounds for people who get stage fright, which I loved lol!). This C2 Toto does not have that button, which is fine for me.

They are a bit spendy so it took me a while to finally break down and buy one now that I’m back in the states. I also hesitated because I thought it’d be difficult to set up, but it’s super straightforward! (I’m happy my bathroom has an outlet so close to the toilet!)
I got the oval shaped/elongated washlet and it fits perfectly!

The Premist and deodorizer work like a charm, and I like the warm seat and soft closing lid features! The dryer works as it should and is nice but I imagine you’d have to sit for more than a few minutes to get fully dry, and I’m impatient so toilet paper is still needed, just less of it!

I’m super satisfied with the Toto brand washlet!! <3
TOTOのウォシュレットがとても好きです！買って嬉しいです。"
I wanted to give Toto brand a try and blown away at the quality and ease of installation. It only took about 10 minute to install and was super easy. Once hooked up the seat took a few minutes to warm up but once it was it was nice and roasty. The pressure performance is great. The heated water tank works great for nearly any use case. If you sit there for a bit sure it will get cold but under normal daily use you will never get to the cold water. I also have products from the big K company name found this offered much better performance. I will only buy Toto brand toilet products moving forward.
" We had this model installed couple of days back. The installation was super easy and the installation guide that comes with the product is pretty straightforward. For us, it took ~20 mins to install start to finish. Make sure you tighten the screws until it stops moving further. This model has great features like heated seat, warm water, dryer, team and front cleaner, energy saver mode, water pressure control etc. overall a great product and I’d recommend buying this product if you want a simple, clean and touch less than experience 😉 great for small kids and elderly family members 👍"
"Perfect for what we need!
We used this in our trip to Hawaii and loved it.
Works just as promised and love the simplicity!"
"First off, installing this bidet didn't take too much time once I read the instructions and it clearly explains what you need to do. My toilet is not from Toto, and I didn't have issues attaching the base plate and seat. Let's just say that my family loved it. Everything is luxury to me as this would be the first time I owned a bidet with warm seat, a controllable nozzle, dryer, mist that sprays when you sit on the bowl, self cleaning. Although I find the dryer kind of weak, which I was expecting a little more out of it. It does reduces toilet paper consumption as you could get your rear dry to a point and finish it off with a small amount of toilet paper. For women though, I don't think the dryer will be enough for the front. So a small toilet paper will be used to wipe dry. The water pressure isn't super strong, but, if you adjust the position of the spray, it will make a difference.

I don't care about the deodorizer, as I wouldn't want to replace a filter for it, but, if it's very stink, it would be nice to use it. Another thing I loved is the fact that the soft cover closes quietly and covers the seat completely as to prevent germs from escaping. So sanitizing the cover will be nice to do every once in awhile. I would give them another star if the dryer has settings to increase the strength cause it feels a little weak. To dry your rear a little quicker, angle it a little at the dryer. Otherwise I think I made a good choice for a bidet and the warm seat and water is a must for colder climates and especially during winter and early spring.

This will definitely reduce toilet paper consumption unless you have diarrhea or constipation, I would use toilet paper still. Otherwise, this is a great buy"
"Say goodbye to using TP. With the blow dryer option, I no longer have to use any TP. I feel much cleaner too compared to using TP. I recommend getting it for around $300, set a price alert. These units usually come down to $300 for a couple of days then back up to the $350 plus range.

I don't use the deodorizer option that much bc it's just mainly me who is using the bathroom. I do like the soft close feature and the seat warmer is really nice.

The premist option is also lovely. I hate it when the kaka is stuck to the walls, but with the premist option, the kaka just falls right down. :D

The heated water is great. When the water shoots up, it feels so good with the warm water, the feeling is soothing.

Do yourself a favor, and buy this Toto. I was blown away at the quality of Totos when I was in Japan. They are truly the gold standard in bidets. You won't regret getting one of these. I went from a regular bidet that just sprayed water to this fully featured one and it's like riding a bike then driving a car."
"This is a really good value... If you're a man, you can live without toilet paper now. If you're a woman, it's going to be a bit of a chore to dry your lady bits with the warm air dryer. It would be a lot easier to straddle it reverse cowgirl, but the control panel gets in the way of that.

If you have a lady in the house, and don't mind changing batteries once a year, the C5, K300 or an S500e is a worthwhile upgrade. They all have premist that reduces toilet bowl cleaning.

If you only have one toilet and don't have male guests, automatic flush after automatic lid closing might be worth it for you. You can only retrofit that with an S7A plus an Auto-flush Unit right now. The S7 series is also easier to clean as it has a seamless lid, so it's better for commercial settings, if you can protect the remote. Realistically this C2 is probably the one I'd use for wide commercial deployment. It should be said that the s550e has a stronger air dryer than the S7A or C2/5, and it will prevent fights over putting the lid down, so if you can't get an Auto-flush unit fitted, the s550e is the best for couples, even if it's harder to clean and has a bigger bump. If you're a single woman with one bathroom, nothing beats the s500e.

I should mention that the s500e, s550e and S7 series all require 1.3kW of power, which may require rewiring or special consideration. The 400W A2, C2, C5 and k300 can work anywhere, even with a shared cheap extension cord.

Enjoy!"
"This is my second bidet. The first one is a Biobidet from Costco, price a little less than half of thisone on sale price. This one has extra premist and deodorizer functions, and a well-known name. The Biobidet has unlimited water function, this Toto has a tank. Toto with unlimited water comes with an even high price tag. The Biobidet comes with an installation paper template that makes installation easier, I used it on the Toto installation too. After installation, the Toto still move side to side, it is designed like that, the Biobidet is solid and does not move. The other user mentioned the seat underneath bump is uneven, I think that is intentional, when seated the seat is pressed down and it senses in use. The Biobidet uses skin sensor so the seat is even. Even I could return the Toto for a cheaper unit, but I think it is not worth all the hassle. If they both hold up, I think I would not mind a cheaper unit. They offer similar comfort."
"I opted for shorter hoses than what was supplied and installed a GFCI behind the tank for a neater install.

If I had to nitpick, I just wish the warm water lasted for longer and that TOTO offered an easily-fitted inline filter cartridge. I live in an area with hard water and that can make short work of the intricate pumps, nozzles and waterways in this unit. To that extent, I fashioned my own using off-the-shelf components from a local plumbing supply store.

I would highly recommend anybody do the same if purchasing this (or any other high-end bidet)."
"It took a bit to get used to where the water hits, but once I did, the clean, fresh feeling after using the bathroom was wonderful. The dryer is nice but it takes a long time so, as a woman, I’d use a small amount of paper to dab away any remaining water droplets after I was done with dryer."
No remote control included. Works well!
The Toto Bidet Toilet Seat is well-made with more features than my other one made by another company. It arrived quickly and was very easy to install - taking less than 45 minutes to do so. Highly recommend this product.
"I was surprised that it works, period, AND, as well as it does. Previous to use (and I had been thinking about one since a dear friend went on and on about them), I really couldn't fathom how one of these was going to work effectively, but it does. I will say on the install, pushing the rubber grommets through, even when wet, didn't work. the solution: get it through as far as you can absent blowing a gasket, and then thread the screws into the female screw receptacle and push it in that way. out of beginning experiences: 3 out of 5 uses provided the cleanest wiping ever experienced. 2 of 5 had side residue. When told, I didn't believe this would happen either, and when I tried I couldn't make it work, but when not trying it happened: a slight enema type experience that coaxed out material not even realized! and FWIW, I was very skeptical, and had looked two years ago and not found anything I was comfortable with."
"My wife and I just installed this a week ago and it's amazing. What a phenomenal invention. I'm going to put one in all the bathrooms in our house, now."
"... and purchase the TOTO C2 (or any of Toto's electronic bidets) for yourself and your family. We have one TOTO C200 WASHLET and BioBidet Slim Two, but after the BioBidet hinge broke 3 times, I swore I'd never go back to having such a bad experience and chose the updated C2 WASHLET by TOTO which I knew would not fail as a trusted name in the industry.

Aside from the heat controlled cleaning, drying, and seating, the thing that amazes me the most are the details:

- patented water aeration definitely cleans more effectively (and gently) than the non-aerated streams from other brands

- deodorizer does not mask bad odors, instead it effectively reduces/completely eliminates them via an extractor fan that forces the air from the bowl through the removable activated charcoal filter. This is a great feature for a full house or multi-roommate situation and eliminates wait time after each use.

When I first read about the deodorizing feature, I thought it was a gimmick, but alas, it actually works and it's quite impressive. After using my first TOTO C200 and now this updated C2 model, the feature is an absolute deal breaker for me in a house with multiple people. This simple technology alone should be a basic feature on all toilets and bidets! I no longer have to use the noisy bathroom fan, aerosol sprays, expensive candles, or light matches to cover odors -- the C2 takes care of it for me when I get up from the seat. There is also a button to manually activate the extractor while in situ. This feature is amazingly effective -- I always thought activated charcoal was such hype but it really does eliminate foul odors on the spot.

Musk and Bezos take note: SpaceX and Blue Origin should reach out to TOTO for a collaboration to design a highly compact integrated commode with deodorizing and waste storage for future spacecraft designs. Today, New York Times reported that the Dragon capsule toilet is temporarily offline and astronauts had to wear diapers while a solution is being developed. Diapers...

Bottom line: While I prefer BioBidet's seat construction quality (the plastic seems more rigid, dense, and capacitive), TOTO has more to offer in terms of its unique features such as the electrolyzed eWater and its renowned soft closing lid, which NEVER breaks like the other brands. If TOTO's seats were capacitive as it is on the BioBidet's Slim Two (versus a weight triggered switch as it is on the WASHLETs), it would be a perfect product. In any case, the C2 is a reasonably priced alternative to the other very expensive TOTO models on the market and one that will save you money, your health and substantially reduce water consumption and paper waste. No more unflushable wipes ever!"
The best thing since sliced bread( no pun attended). Used this while in Japan and just had to have one at home. My son installed one in his home and help me with the electrical required. The Toto unit was the best selection for the money with all the features this is just what the doctor ordered. Even my partner loves it as she did not use in Japan but now is a big fan. Now to save on the towel paper and enviroment impact.
"If u have never tried a bidet, u got order this one. Our last one gave up the ghost after 10 years. Great product. If u ever use one , u will be hooked! Clean, sanitary, I wish I knew about this 40 years ago."
"Love, love, love this toilet seat. So easy to use."
"Like the seat. Easy to install. Always seems a little loose and we can’t get it tighter without cracking the plastic so it’s shifts around a lot. Be aware that if you put it on an elevated toilet it will be even higher, it’s like I need a step stool to get on. Also the dryer function does not actually dry you well."
"Love everything about this. I don't have hot water, so the fact that it can heat its own water is great. Easy enough to install too"
"This bidet seat isn't cheap, but it works wonderfully well for me. Easy to use and very comfortable. Unfortunately my husband cannot grasp the basic concept of sitting down on the toilet (bidet) seat and using the controls to clean himself. He ""misses"" the toilet bowl on a daily basis. He thinks the seat is defective but believe me, it works as intended very well."
"My friend has one and recommended this model, it’s awesome"
"Easy to install, intuitive functionalities, fantastic product overall."
Seasoned bidet user here. The seat warmer is heavenly as is the warm water. However the effectiveness of the bidet feature definitely could be better. With my old cheapy bolt on bidet there was plenty of pressure and it seemed a bit wider of a spray. Although this Toto does have pin point accuracy and a oscillating feature I more times then not have to go another round. So I give 3 stars for the fact due to price and the lacking ability of the main feature. However the other perks I mentioned are reason enough for me to keep. Hope this helps.
"I bought a cheaper bidet attachment in the past but never really got used to using it. I decided to try the upgraded version and got this, and I cannot go back! The heated seat and water and the dryer really makes a big difference. No more sitting on cold toilet seats on chilly days and the dryer feature helps save on toilet paper as well. You can adjust the water position to your liking as well as the temperature and pressure. The only thing is at night if you don’t turn on the lights you won’t be able to see the buttons, but after enough use it becomes muscle memory. I also had to buy a separate pipe connector when installing it because my current water pipe wasn’t compatible, but other than that the installation is fairly simple and fast."
"Toto has a quintillion different toilets and about as many bidets. I made the mistake of buying one that was compatible with the Drake toilet, but I ordered the wrong model. My Drake is the new model with the extra hole in the top to accommodate a bidet, so the Washlet I bought did not fit.

If you have the toilet with the extra hole on top, you need to get the 3074T40#01 model. It has the water hose located in a slightly different location, facing downward to fit through the extra hole. That one is the correct model for the toilet with the new extra hole.

Installation is relatively easy. It takes about an hour total to put it on and hook up the water and electricity. Everything you need is in the box except the tools. You will need a Philips screwdriver, a rag and a cup to catch the small amount of water that comes out of the tank when you remove the original hose fitting. Otherwise it's simple enough for almost anyone to install.

Once installed, it's a nice device. It's comfortable, pleasant to use, and I am confident that we will be happy with it for a long time. It's nicely made, sturdy, and relatively easy to keep clean."
"Truly a wonderful gift for myself. Got to experience the magic of Toto for 2 weeks in Japan. When I got home, it was a must have."
"I recently spent 3 weeks visiting my daughter living in Japan and I quickly realized they know what's up!

I notices right off the bat (in the airport), they had Todo Washlets and I was intrigued. It didn't take me long to realize I must have one of these in my home. In fact, I placed my order even before I was back from vacation. I quickly started doing my research on which one would be most suitable. I knew I wanted one with warm water, a heated seat and one that had a pre-rinse to help with annoying ""skid marks"" sometimes left on toilets. This washlet has all of those and more! I had never used the drying feature and boy and I happy I decided to purchase one with a drying feature. It's an additional function that will help cut down on TP consumption.

I found it quite easy to install myself once I had an electrician install a GFCI outlet next to my toilet (which is a must for safety). I will be ordering a 2nd one for my guest bath so when my daughter returns to the states from living in Japan, she'll feel as if she's still there....well sort of, ha!

I read a number of these reviews before purchasing and was concerned when I also discovered one of the front bumpers on the underside of the seat was higher than the other, resulting in a very small gap. After thoroughly reading the instructions, I've learned this is to turn on the pre-rinse and deotorizer features once sitting on the seat moves the seat down slightly thus activating the switch. I don't think this is a flaw as some other reviews have claimed it to be.

I highly recommend! You will NOT regret and your tush will thank you!"
"Got this, my plumber installed it on my toilet (which burned up like 2 weeks of the 30 days they give you to claim an issue) ... worked great for about the first month... than it began to drip where the provided parts attached to the water... I put a bowl under the drip but the dripping escalated during the week to the point of totally filling a large soup bowl in about an hour ... my plumber came to fix it and said as the parts are made of cheap plastic rather than metal as they should have been if he tightens it more than he has it'll crack.

I tried contacting amazon and got computers instead of humans, so I'm basically stuck with a very pricy item that will cause thousands of dollars of damage if I use it because it was made so cheaply.

note: contacted local distributors of toto products (amazon was useless) one of whom had me send them images of the leak ... they then gave me the phone number for TOTO customer support who also wanted to see the photos and proof of my recent purchase of the unit on amazon... THEY were helpful and sent me a replacement part which came in a week and the distributor/plumber sent one of their guys who had the most experience with fixing these to my place after the part arrived. Toto said if that didn't fix the problem they'd troubleshoot with me to try to fix it... but that wasn't necessary. While I still keep a bowl under the fixture just in case, it's been months now without any more problems."
"We now have 4 of these and they are fantastic. If you don't use a bidet seat, you need to broaden your horizons. It makes any toilet a lot more luxurious."
"If you have not experienced a TOTO washlet, you are missing the best thing since sliced bread. Period.

They thought of everything. Easy to install. Call Toto or chat online to figure out which fits your Toto toilet. It is a great product. Heated seat, water and drying. This is my second one in my home."
Only trick for the installation is two rubber tube are too big to insert into two holes of toilet/ need to figure out another way to install two screws
After having buyer’s remorse this was returned. My wife felt it was way too complicated. The water reservoir only holds a small amount of pre-warmed water. I’m sure it’s a fine enough product but we also felt the size of the seat was not to our liking. I cannot band mouth a product I could return. Best Wishes to TOTO.
"We got two TOTO SW3074#01 WASHLET C2 Electronic Bidet Toilet Seats a couple of weeks ago. Love everything about them! Having travelled a lot in Japan I have enjoyed washlet seats for years, and I finally decided to get my own. I did replace two round-bowled toilet with elongated bowls. I think that is essential. The mechanism at the back does take space and round bowl would get awfully cramped. Installation was super easy. It only takes a few minutes. I am still waiting for electrician to install an outlet in the wall behind the toilet, but until he has time for me I just bought a grounded three foot extension that I have routed to the regular outlet over the bathroom sink. I got the Toto because they are the original washlet inventor and most of the washlets I have come across in Japan are made by them. Couldn't be happier."
I have 2 of these. One doesn’t make afillkng noise
Toto Washlet SW3074 we love it. My husband noticed today the defect underneath the seat that causes the seat to wiggle due to uneven button elevation.
"First, this is a great bidet system. Having had a similar model/brand while living in Japan, I needed to have one in my own bathroom here in the US.

Recently I updated my bathroom with a new elongated toilet and my old bidet (by another company) was for a round toilet.

In searching for my next new upgrade, this time I really wanted my “made in Japan” official Toto Bidet system. Upgrade is what I was expecting but in reality it wasn’t to be.

My previous Bidet by a Korean Company had features such as auto-clean and dry which ran a wash/dry cycle for 1 to 2 minutes.

This is not an option on Toto (especially this model). I made an assumption that auto washing and drying would be common. Instead Toto tells you to press the wash button, hit stop button, hit dry button, hit stop button. While you can jump from wash to dry button without hitting the stop button, you do need to hit stop button to stop the drying process.

This to me is insane, 4 times touching and pressing buttons and wear/tearing on the membrane buttons.

As much as I truly wanted Toto Brand, I think I need to return this one for a Korean Brand.

This one feature for me is enough to reconsider Toto in the future."
This bidet does it all for a great price
Worth it.
"I purchased bio bidet 2 years ago, similar to this Toto. Now I can say Toto at the same price level is better.
I traveled to Japan where I met first time these bidet concepts, before was in Argentina as a separate vase. Toto I believe is the leading brand in Japan, I saw really sophisticated devices. I decided this year to give a try.
Why is better,
installation is easier and comes with everything you need
It has a deodorizer, like the bigger brothers in Japan, at same price level not for Bio B
the dryer is powerful and you feel in the area
water is plenty and also you can get good pressure
Both my bidets are elongated and Toto is bigger which is great.

Very pleased with the product."
Amazing toilet seat. A pleasure each and every time. I feel pampered. Worth every penny.
"This is my second Toto toilet seat after one year of the first purchase. Very pleased. Second one, I chose the wired model. Not much difference. Don’t need to use batteries and worry about possible losing the remote control. One important point is that no body mentioned. The instruction only shows the graphical guide without description. The two rubber screws shoes, use water (cold) to rinse it before installing, otherwise it is very tight and difficult to install. Very important."
"I like having a bidet. I've had one for years I bought a new house and wanted one for the primary bathroom. I'm actually somewhat disappointed. There is no delicate way to explain, so here goes. It might as well have only one setting because the ""wand"" only reaches the rear unless you do some body contortions to get it to reach the front. I dId a lot of research before buying this one, actually bypassing the #1 rated bidet, because that one apparently has issues with the seat (the actual one you sit on). There have been several reports of the seat breaking and having to be replaced. Nevertheless, I was convinced that I was buying the best. The construction seems sound, but what good is that if it doesn't perform its duties? All of the other features, blow dry, scent the air, etc are just gravy. The important part is the washing - definitely not up to par."
"I recently moved from Japan to a townhouse in US and promptly installed this Washlet, which I had become accustomed to as a Japanese. I had never installed a Washlet by myself when I was in Japan, but it was very easy to do and I am satisfied with it. I only purchased one this time, but if I buy a house with two or more toilets in the future, I plan to purchase them again."
"Recently purchased to replace an s300e that had succumbed to the hard water in my building. The SW3074 is a great value: Almost all of the functionality of the higher-end unit, but at about half the price. Who needs a remote, anyway? This thing is great. Easy to install and very good quality. Highly recommended!"
"I'm mad/sad/glad, let me explain. Mad because I like this washlet so much, I ended up buying one for each of my three bathrooms, adding expenses I wasn't planning on. Sad because nearly everywhere else I use the WC, I won't get the luxury and cleanliness I have at home. I might be so sad I won't go out at all, anywhere, ever. And glad because I can die knowing I've had a very simple pleasure for the rest of my days. I can't wait to go to Japan where washlets are the norm. The customizable features are lovely. I don't find the unit uncomfortable, loud, finicky, or other complaints. I love the welcoming warm seat, the customizable pressure and placement of the water stream, the temperature of the water, seat, and dryer. I'm so happy to share the joys of the washlet when I have guests. If you are on the fence on this, don't be. Pull the trigger. You'll be so glad you did. Go with the industry leader."
"If you are looking through reviews to try and decide whether this is worth it...just stop. The only problem is when you have to go and you are away from home. Once you start using this Bidet, you will be bummed (hehe) if you have to go at work or somewhere else.
Its VERY easy to install. You need an outlet reasonably close to the toilet. We have had it for about a year and its still perfect. There is a model with remote...I don't think the remote is worth it. This model is extremely easy to use by hitting buttons with right hand. I don't write too many reviews, but I am compelled to help anyone thinking about this bidet attachment. It is VERY much worth every penny. I recommend it constantly."
"Added to a spare bathroom and it works wonderfully! Just enough warm water (it has limited amount), adjustable sprayer and pressure with and added bonus of a blower to help dry off. Good value when purchased as a “very-good condition” returned item from the warehouse."
"I left a previous review saying how there is cold air once sat down, it’s actually the mist spraying function. I trouble shoot today. My bad. I turned off the mist spraying function, and no more cold air. I recommend read the manual carefully before using.
So far so good. Except the hot air drying somewhat feels like cold air maybe because wet areas feel colder than usual. Since the whole purpose of buying this for me is to have hot air drying , I’m slightly disappointed."
"We remodeled our master bathroom recently and added this great bidet seat to our new Toto commode. I was a bit surprised at how much it cost (it seemed like a lot) but after using it, and appreciating all of the features, I think it was money very well spent. The water for cleansing is heated, if you choose to turn that feature on. There is a blower to dry the wet parts, also with temperature adjustability. The seat itself has heat settings just in case you feel the need for warm buns. The bidet seat also filters air from the bowl area to remove odors. That's pretty cool. Apparently my thinking that my schizz doesn't stink is now proven! The seat even squirts a little water into the bowl when there is first weight on it upon sitting down. This happens to assist with helping to keep tootsie rolls from smearing on the bowl. Clever folks, eh! Installing this bidet seat was much more economical than adding a separate bidet fixture next to the commode, and saves lots of floor space as well."
"I got this about a month ago, and have been using it since. While it is certainly a worthwhile purchase, and it is significantly better than a non-bidet seat, some of the higher end features are scaled down. When I shopped, I did not think I would miss them, but I do. I do enjoy having this one, but if I were to buy it again, I'd probably spring for the extra couple of hundred dollars to have the seat open when I walked into the bathroom, to have it light up the bowl at night, and to have a handheld remote for the seat. While sitting on this seat, you can't see the controls on the seat (down by your butt), and you have to guess at which button does which. Which changes the water temperature? Which oscillates the stream? Which turns on the dryer? Some of them become habit, but others, you just give up on trying to use. Still, for the price, it's a good seat. But I guess I got spoiled using the higher end ones in the hotels."
"Only issue I have is that the nozzle doesn't seem to remember where I adjust it, and it doesn't seem to come up forwards enough for the back wash setting. I also don't know how a larger person would be able to use this.

Personally, I am really happy with my purchase."
"There are lots of bidets on the market, with lots of features, some of which are more important than others.
This model does not have a remote control, which can make it easier to see and change settings. We found the large built in control to be easy to use and pretty clear labeling of buttons. The controls you use most are on the foreward end making them easiest to reach. This model was easy to install, had a long enough power cord (we added an outlet for it), and an intereting 'eco mode'. Since most bidets heat seats, water and air, the question is whether these heaters should be on all the time, which can use a surprising amount of electricity (look at the wattage ratings), This model allows you to pick 'off periods' such as over night, when you want to turn off all the heaters, It is a little strange to set up, since the time for being off begins at the time of day you enter the setting. But it works. We like it."
"This is my first washlet and I have to say I am a big fan. I am very happy with the features and functionality of this model. I wanted the version with the separate hand held remote control but that was $150 more so I chose this one. I was concerned that looking to the side of the toilet seat to control it would be an issue but it is not, the controls you use most are on the end so it is easily visible and reachable. I was also concerned whether or not the warm water tank would be enough vs. continues water but the warm water supply is enough to do what I need it to do. I also use the dryer feature to some extent which I didn't think I would use at all. All and all I thought of this as a frivolous purchase but now that I have one it is more ""essential"" to me than I ever thought it would be.

The only negative I can think of is when you look at it, the unit looks like a medical device and it can be a bit daunting but it is functional and works well."
"I recently purchased this bidet, and let me tell you, it has completely transformed how I approach my bathroom routine! I never thought I'd be raving about a bidet, but this incredible device has surpassed all my expectations.

Setting it up was a breeze, thanks to the clear and detailed instructions provided. In just a matter of minutes, my bidet was ready to go, and I was eager to give it a try. From the very first moment I experienced the gentle and refreshing spray, I knew I'd never want to go back."
"My first one was great, but hard to install. Then I bought one each for my daughter's house, and my 2 granddaughters. Kind of a weird present for Christmas, but what the hey. Once you start using one of these you can't really imagine going back to TP. When I bought the 3 new ones I found they had improved the installation design. By the way, use the YouTube installation guides as the written instructions are virtually useless. Easy as pie, and I have become expert at putting them in. The hardest part was removing the old toilet seat bolts which had rusted so had to be sawed off. Forget all the fancy stuff like remotes and lights in the toilet (who wants to see the stuff in the bowl? You want a night light, get a separate light for about 2 bucks.) You can get the basic C100 for about $400. Be nice to your butt and get a Toto. I've had mine now for about 4 years with ZERO problems. Pay no attention to some of the reviews that say they leak and all. You'll like it."
"Got this because i was recently in the UK and the Hyatt hotel i stayed at had one. Loved it, bought one as soon as I got home.

I was very surprised by how easy it was to install. Just make sure you have a power outlet by the area its going in."
Don't know how I lived without this before. Recently took second trip to Japan and decided I need to get one of these. I laugh everything the air dryer comes on. ..feels like a luxury item I can't believe I have. It's amazing. All the features work perfectly. No complaints. Super easy installation.
"First, I would like to note that I received the unit slightly damaged, with a corner having chipped off in a shard-like piece. Since it wasn't on the front, I abandoned the idea of shipping it back for a new one.

We've had this unit in place now for about 19 months. Over the last 6-8 months I have noticed a HORRIBLE smell emanating from the Washlet C2. It smells like bad electronics or the smell of band-aids. It's not a toilet smell at all. I've tried everything from steaming the seat and parts to bleaching the parts and cleaning the air filter. The smell comes back almost immediately.

I contacted Toto USA early in 2023 to ask them about this. Since it was out of warranty, the best they could offer is sending a box so I could have it shipped to them for a $175 service fee. I agreed and gave them my address. July of 2023 now and I have not received a box or any contact from Toto. Terrible service.

While the unit does a fine job at cleaning the areas that need to be cleaned, I cannot say this is a good or low-maintenance unit. It has been a disappointment in that regard especially considering it was nearly $500."
"Know before you buy.
TL;DR: it is far from perfect, but better than nothing. IMHO, the manual bidet style found in some countries is better engineered for an effective wash.

Pros:
++ Washes and dries your behind
+ Warm water
+ Mostly self-cleaning

Be aware:
* It reduces the seat size: if you are a large person, it could be a problem
* It's quite large
* It makes water sounds on its own, including when not in used and at night

Problems:
--- For me, it does not completely clean: toilet paper 'quality control' shows that it doesn't
This is a big deal, because I still use toilet paper.
It also means that the deodorizer will switch on when I use toilet paper (you can turn this off in settings), and that the warm water reservoir is not sufficient for all the water I need and I eventually get cold water.

-- If you have larger thighs or legs, they will touch and partially cover the controls. My rather skinny leg is less than an inch away from the tip of the controls.

-- The drier takes too long to do its job. So, even if it does clean for you, you will still use toilet paper.

- The seat is not the most comfortable."
"First time I used it I almost hit the ceiling. Forty-five minutes later I was trying to figure out how to add arm rests with built in cup holders. Now instead of my mother yelling at me to get out of the bathroom when I was 14, it's my wife doing the yelling now.

Looks to be well built."
"Bought this Toto after returning two other seats. Absolutely the best choice. The other two seats had mediocre water pressure and not the best make quality when compared to the seat I had for 12 years and was replacing.
Toto was the leading brand toilet product when I was in Japan on a business trip. their installed in most of the hotels. That's where I discovered the luxury of a Bidet seat and it's benefits. Will not be returning this seat!"
"I bought this months ago. Still it never ceased to amaze me. It is INCREDIBLE. Heated seat for those cold winters nights, adjustable sprayer to get even the most stubborn waste, adjustable temperature so you don’t die every morning. Get this."
"We just received it and is not installed yet. However, we have another of the same model, and it has been on the job for two years. It has spoiled us, so we had to have another to stop the fighting over the first one!! It has most, if not all of the best features."
"This bidet has been my favourite purchase. It helped my girlfriend and I through a difficult time when she broke both her wrists. The heating features are a nice addition during the winter, the pressure I tend to keep on the lower end, and I only really use the soft spray option most days."
"Easy way to jazz up a bathroom. After a trip to Japan, I knew I needed a heated toilet seat. This makes a trip to the toilet a real pleasure…like a spa visit. Why doesn’t every house have one of these?"
"Look I wrote a big long review, but this is a toilet sheet that does EXACTLY what it advertises and more. The cleanliness factor is outstanding and for the price it punches far above its competition. The seat warmer is exemplary. You simply won’t be disappointed, and you will be fresher and more hygienic. One of the best purchases I’ve made, you’ll see for yourself!"
"Took like 15 minutes to install (after watching a Youtube video installing a similar model). Works great! Had to use an extension cord to deliver it power since I don't have a plug by my toilet, but it's worth it!

Pros:
Perfect bidet water stream angles
Great heated water and seat temperatures
Self cleaning and deordorizing features work better than I expected them to
Controls buttons work well and seem sufficiently waterproofed

Cons:
Could be a tad cheaper
Hot water runs out if you sit for too long or use a really high pressure
Air dryer doesn't blow THAT hard so it takes 1-3 minutes of sitting there to get noticeably drier"
"This is our second one of this style, and we have one with remote control and more bells and whistles. This new one works very well and once you have one you’ll never go back. I do miss the light that comes on when you approach it with the remote control model. One thing I’m not happy about is that our remote control one stopped working and I tried all troubleshooting in manual to no avail. We bought this one to replace it while we tried to figure out how to get it serviced because there is no service available in NM. I called the company and found out that the problem may just be to reset the remote and that many other people have called about it. Oh well, now we can hopefully get it started and have another awesome toilet."
"If you don't have a bidet in your home I can no longer visit. I no longer trust your hygiene. Dorothy has it right ""there's no place like home"". Who knew TOTO wasn't actually a dog...she was dreaming about her bidet!"
Don’t buy a crummy bidet. You use the thing multiple times a day (maybe) and it is a superior method of cleaning up after you-know-what! Buy this thing. And you don’t need a separate remote control. Save yourself $50.
"Installation is pretty easy and simple. Watch videos on Youtube or read that manual. All the information you need is there. I bought this knowing this winter is gonna be cold. You don't know what you're missing out on until you buy this. A heated seat is totally worth is during these winter months. The bidet cleans while being gentle and doesn't spray your butt like a firefighter hose on lower-end bidets, which is unnecessarily over powered. Plus there is a dryer and deodorizer that gets rid of any terrible smell. Be classy and buy this bidet...what are we savages that use toilet paper all the time?"
"Perfect, with a heated seat, water and dryer that’s all contained in one unit. All you MUST do is make sure you have a GFI 110v outlet behind the toilet. It’s basically “plug and play”."
Despite being broken on delivery I engaged Toto's customer support. Best thing to happen. As they shipped a new unit to me quickly. I'm NOT going to fault the seller. We all know shmooey hapens.
I originally gave 1 star because I thought the seat was uneven. There are 4 bumps under the seat and one of them is shorter than others. We thought it was a defect but it turns out that it is designed in this way so that the weight sensor can know when a human sits on it. We have been using it for a year and it has been working great!!
"I have been using a bidet for more than 5 years. I had an older version that broke because the water holes got plugged even though I have a water softener filter for my entire house. I bought this one to replace the other one and this one has an automatic cleaning wand, so I don't have to remember to do it myself. This one specifically does not have a control but I would not like a control anyways. The controls are attached to the bidet and that way for me it doesn't get misplaced. It has an odor eliminator that works very nicely. Overall I definitely would recommend it. Regarding how soft the seat is, it is not soft. It is a normal seat without pads of any kind, but since it is warm I don't need a soft seat."
"I'm a contractor purchased this product for a client of mine, its a really nice unit, lots of features and no remote control to lose."
"I’ve had these toliet seats before and they work great but upon opening my third one it had a crack in the back casing that you can’t see when the seat is attached, possibly cracked during shipping. But they work great and last a long time!"
"Other than the screw plugs being unbelievably tight to get in the installation was a breeze. As for functionality it matches or surpasses our expectations, worth every cent! Having a septic system we wanted to reduce paper and this pretty much illuminated the primary paper use."
"I love this. I'm hemiplegic so, personal care after toileting is near impossible. This has given me back some independence and dignity. It's easy to use and the seat and water are always warm. The warm air blower is a bonus as well. Wish I had one in every bathroom."
"Once you visit Japan and find out how comfortable it is to have electrical washlets you wonder why these are not more widely available.

Unfortunately few properties have power outlets in the toilet rooms. Toto should lobby for regulation to make it standard - such a minor thing for constructors and others could have the option to install an electrical washlet without needing to go through major work to route power outlets.

I never tried other brand but don’t see why I would. Toto is the standard - reliable and has options for different budgets."
"We originally had a much simpler device installed, but swiftly upgraded to this one. As we get older (and fatter) this device is an answer to several issues including cleaning ourselves. I get severe ""diaper rash"". There are few things more annoying while hiking than having to stop 30 minutes to wipe my butt. This bidet is helping minimize that by getting me cleaner before I leave to hike.
It is not perfect, in part because I have food sensitivities such as to milk products. However, it makes me cleaner which reduces the soreness and irritation."
"My daughter has a bidet at her house, same brand. Hers has a separate remote. My husband got this one with the control on the side of it. I’m really not a fan of this style. It looks huge. Plus the seat won’t stay put and no matter how many times my husband tightens it, it still gets loose."
"This is the second Bidet we've had. It does a good job, is easy to control, has plenty of warm water in the reservoir, and has a very superior drying function. We previously had a bio-bidet, that had a nice ""automatic cycle"" feature that this one lacks, but the drying function on that one was terrible. This one does a good job cleaning and an effective job drying, making it the superior choice.

It was easy to install and came with clear instructions and all necessary parts."
"We had similar product at my work. Recently my wife mentioned she never tried one but thought she would like it. Having used before, I knew she would! I installed it in her bathroom as a surprise! Literally took me less than 15 minutes. She has been raving about it to all her friends!!!! It has all the feature you would/could expect. Great price, great value. I just purchased a second one for my bathroom and will probably order 2 more for our second home. All I can say is, 'Life is short, pamper yourself.' You will not regret it. By the way, I'm writing this review while I'm sitting on.... We'll you get the idea. ;-)"
This works great.
"I’ve had 2 Toto toilets for over 20 yrs and they have performed flawlessly! I had a Toto bidet/ heated seat in the master bath, and now I have one for my spare bathroom. The bidet has so many features and the quality is the best !! I highly recommend this bidet/ heated seat by Toto !!"
Everyone could use a little fresher after dropping off your stuff! Advanced features like intensity of the water stream and location are amazing. Heated seat and deodorizer make this device a 💩 dream!
"The functionality is fine as advertised, however the first one I received (as well as the replacement) seem to have some sort of manufacturing defect. The bumpers on the bottom of the seat do not rest evenly on the bowl. If you check the pictures they are all wildly different heights resulting in a very uneven seat that feels like over time it will stress and break. In the end I gave up and installed my own bumpers and it is slightly less uneven. I would have expected for the price that the product wouldn't have this sort of flaw.

Update: Over time I have noticed the pressure decreasing until a month past warranty and there is no longer any water coming out of the spray nozzle, just barely a trickle. All hoses and filters are fine but no water comes out. Disappointedly switching back to a mechanical bidet until I can find something of higher quality."
"Forget about the fluffy towels or new sinks, this is the best upgrade to a bathroom. It is so much cleaner and soothing. I had the opportunity to try this out on a business trip to Tokyo and never forgot the comfort. Did not realize until recently it could be fitted onto a existing toilet. Highly recommend, very happy with performance. Only improvement I would suggest is a slightly longer plug; it is only about two feet long and it situated on the left-hand side. So either requires an electrician to put in a new outlet or an extension cord (which is not recommended by Toto). I did not get unit with remote control and cannot imagine why I would want it."
"Super simple to install and set up. We did buy a longer electric cord because this is a retrofit and the plug in is vanity height. The deodorizer works great, no need for Poo-pouri before using, the seat gets nice and toasty, you can customize that to your preference, and I love that the rear cleanse has on/off oscillating as well as a gentle button. The feminine wash wand setting allows for customizing the best distance for you, still not quiet forward enough, but I’m tall and have a “longer” lap. The dryer works provided you allow enough time, if your in a hurry, a little TP gets you dry quicker. Definitely Recommend. Currently renovating Master Bath and will be installing a bidet."
"One of the best purchases I’ve ever made. Yes it’s pricy, but it’s 100% worth it. Lots of features, but intuitive. I was pleasantly surprised by how long the 3-prong cord is, it made using an extension unnecessary. Setup was < 15 min. If you’re considering buying one, my recommendation is to do it."
"I have terrible back problems and in the morning it is very hard to move let alone twist or bend. The Toto bidet has been a lifesaver for me. Not only does it help with your hygiene but it's very nice in the middle of the night to sit on a warm seat. I do not have a remote on mine mine is at the side of the seat but the lights make it very easy for you also in the evening. This was recommended to me by a friend oh, and I have recommended it to many other friends young and old. You won't be disappointed"
This is a good product but you will be unable to find a replacement for the deodorizer which works really well for six months or so (your mileage may vary). This is unfortunate since one of the main reason we sprung for a toto over a cheaper bidet was the deodorizing feature in a bathroom that has no other ventilation. I reached out to Toto and they pointed me to a general parts page. Pretty ridiculous to sell a product with a filter you can't replace.
"This is much better than paper for the wallet, the environment and for hygiene. This also heats the seat and the water so it's not cold. Would never go back"
"Everything seems to work on the seat, but-unfortunately I can’t see the controls when I sit down. I purchased and installed it day before I had arm surgery. I have another TOTO at work that I purchased from Costco, and it has a remote, but it only has the water, and the water pressure is lower."
"Works as expected, I should've bought sooner. Easy installation."
The control panel lights did not all work. The blower door was broken off and the water was initially warm then turned cold after a few seconds. Customer service kept disconnecting my call 4 times. So I returned the item and purchased a different brand.
"I'm a little over 6ft and workout. Due to the water tank, you're left with less of an opening in the seat. They solve this by pushing the seat farther forward and making the opening smaller.

Secondly, the Wand doesn't go back far enough for me. I have to scoot a little forward for it to hit, even after filling adjusting it.

What this leads to is a scenario where I feel uncomfortably forward but more importantly, my junk touches the front of the bowl now."
"This year to kick off spring, we’re freshening up our powder room. Our guests will be wowed once they experience our new bidet Washlet seat from TOTO. It’s affordable enough that we may have to get an extra one in case no one wants to leave the bathroom. Fancy can be functional.
I love the buttons right on the side of the seat. The kids can even operate it. That minimizes the stream of toilet paper. Now we never worry about finding another roll at an awkward time. The heated seat is a game changer. There is a premist that helps the bowl stay cleaner and that’s less cleaning for me. Yes we’ve learned many things from 2020 and we’re a lot cleaner and smarter at our house. I wonder how we’ve waited so long."
"Without getting too graphic, this bidet makes one feel much cleaner. It has settings to clean your whole underside with different pressures, patterns, etc. that can be pre-set for two user profiles. I was pleasantly surprised at how effective the integrated fan helps with smell and the heated seat, water, and air is a nice touch for those chilly days.

Install was pretty simple using the standard toilet seat attachments. The unit needs power so you'll need a nearby outlet, preferably GFIC. The unit heats cold water on it's own so no need to plumb hot water to it. Cleaning is simple and the unit can be removed from its mounting plate (mounting plate attached to the toilet using the aforementioned attachments) with the push of a button. The air filter can be easily cleaned by sliding out a tab.

I am unsure how much additional electricity the unit draws, but it does have an eco mode and you can lower the heat provided to the seat, sprayed water, and drying air, presumably increasing efficiency. I, however, have not even considered the additional electricity cost as the features are worth it to me.

Absolutely recommended."
"We like all the features of this TOTO bidet: selectable front or back wash; choice of a steady stream or pulsed water or oscillating wand; custom setting of water pressure, temperature, and wand positions for two users; heated, self-closing, soft seat; self-cleaning wand; warm air dryer; wall-mounted infra-red remote using two AA cells.

Our bidet stopped squirting water a few weeks ago: the wand remained retracted and would not self-clean. The heated seat worked, the air dryer worked, but the wand did not. After downloading the excellent 47 page Instruction Manual from the TOTO website, we followed the troubleshooting guide without success. We were just about to return the bidet to the manufacturer, for in-warranty repair, when I decided to simply unplug the bidet from the convenience outlet an electrician had installed behind the toilets in our three bathrooms. I left it unplugged overnight and went to bed. The next morning I plugged the bidet power cord back in and... voila! It was working again! It has been working without any problem ever since.

We live in what has been called ""The Lightning Capital of the United States"" in southwest Gulf-Coast Florida. I suspect that a power surge, caused by a recent thunder storm, confused whatever microprocessor controls the bidet functionality.

Removing power, waiting some time, then re-applying power restores many ""disturbed"" electronics to normal operation. It's the very first thing we do when a personal computer ""locks up"" and will not respond. I don't know why we waited so long to try this ""trick"" on our bidet, but we will be installing a surge-protector at each toilet outlet now. Congratulations to TOTO for building such a robust bidet. TOTO should add a suggestion in their Instruction Manual to try cycling the power if the bidet doesn't work properly.

My wife and I are now saving to purchase two more TOTO bidets, one for the guest bathroom and one for the half-bathroom next to our laundry room. I can't believe we waited twenty-five years before trying to replace toilet paper in our toilets with this nice TOTO bidet. We highly recommend this brand and this model."
"I've waited to review my Washlet, but I can say that after 2 months use, I continually thank myself for finally getting it. It is beautifully thought out and designed as expected from a company with a long history like Toto. It was delivered well boxed and protected. I will not repeat other reviews, but they were very helpful to read, which I did for a LONG time before I ordered the Washlet.

1. It's easy to install. I did have an outlet at the correct side and height already. The instructions are clear and the fittings that come with it are well thought out to eliminate connection problems at the tank. Some of the review videos online were really helpful to watch to confirm that it would be straightforward because I was afraid of screwing up.

2. I did not get this for its heated seat. But it is a wonderful feature that continues to surprise me with a relaxing comfort every time it's used, whether daytime or middle of the night.

3. While you may well have to use one bit of toilet paper to dab off moisture at the end, it is really incredible that the spray cleans - completely - eliminating the need for toilet paper as we are all used to using it. Those of us with hemorrhoids as well, have a very happy bum.
Because of the huge reduction in toilet paper needed, it reduces septic load big time.

4. You'll continue to clean your bowl as you've always done, but cleaning the mechanics of the washing wands, etc will require you to read the very well written manual. It is very easy to slide the unit forward, once installed, to clean underneath the power module at the back. But read the instructions.

Ordering it: It's pretty incredible we can order things like this by mail. That said, big heads up - pay attention to the supplier it's coming from. If it says comes from and ships from Amazon, you are best served by using that. You can see that information over on the right hand side on every Amazon page. If there is more than one supplier and you should research each one. At the time I ordered, it was not ""sold by and shipped from Amazon"". I was able to pick an American plumbing supply company. When I first started researching the Washlet here, there were some shady third party companies offering it and I have been impressed to see Amazon evidently take control of that situation. They also stabilized the price. It's a big ticket item and it matters how the product is handled."
"I was very jazzed to get this product for a family member undergoing cancer treatment. Unfortunately, the first one was damaged in shipment (the plastic frame was cracked and broken, even though the shipping box looked fine). I contacted the manufacturer and got no response. I contacted Amazon and was provided with a return-shipment label. Amazon said I should buy it again if I still wanted it. Amazon did not offer to expedite a replacement. Fortunately, it was still being offered at a discounted price. I tried really hard to get Amazon support to expedite shipping since the delay had such a negative impact. The support person said not to worry and that it would arrive soon ... but there was no concrete way to know for sure that the replacement would ship more quickly. I did receive the replacement a little faster than the first one. Anyway, after all that, it's easy to install and so far, seems to work well. It's way too early to know how reliable and long-lasting it will be, but I'm hopeful. Though I believe Amazon could have been more customer-service oriented by automatically expediting a replacement or offering some credit for the delay, at least Amazon took the broken one back. I actually believe the manufacturer's packaging is inadequate for UPS wear and tear. This product should probably be shipped double-boxed until/if the manufacturer does a better job of packing it."
"Like most Westerners (I believe), I was distrustful that some water-spewing gadget could take the place of toilet paper. But after a recent trip to Japan (where they are everywhere), I'm a believer. Toto bidets (Toto calls them ""washlets"") work brilliantly.

I'm reasonably handy, and I installed mine without difficulty, but be forewarned that there must be an electrical outlet nearby to plug it in. It also features a remote control with a magnetic wall mount making it super-easy to use.

You should also be aware that this model contains a small tank which stores heated water. According to Toto's instructions, after use, the tank will ""recover"" in about ten minutes. Being male, that's not a problem for me. But if this washlet will be in frequent use or if there are many women in your household, you might consider buying an upscale model featuring continuous water heating. In other words, it heats water as it's used so it will never run out."
"We had an electrical plug installed in our main toilet room. The seat was easy to
install, and works great. There was a helpful video on line that showed step-by-step how to install and demo'd the use of the remote. This is good for anyone, but especially for people who don't have the range of motion they once had. All features are excellent and as described."
Wow!! Easy set up 👍🏻 and I can’t say a bad thing. Leaving you clean dry and no need for tp at all. The seat is awesome for cold days. Keeps the toilet clean and kills odors. Little pricy but I love it. You’ll make your money back in tp.
"Product works as advertised. General praise. 2 small things. 1. Heated water lasts for 30 seconds. 2. Our tank is curved so the seat is installed in the forward most position which is slightly awkward.

I would highly recommend this if you are taking care of an aging parent.

The most daunting part of the install is you will ultimately need an outlet. For the time being we are using an extension cord. I was initially concerned that NEC 2020& 2023 home wiring standards are becoming too restrictive to support this. However adding a socket for a toilet seat is allowed per NEC 2023 Section 406.9 Exception No 4, so no worries about placement. Just follow normal GFCI, AFCI, circuit breaker and wire gauge guidelines."
"Happy with this washlet thus far, I like all the functionality, and the heated seat is a little luxury.
I was prepared to install it myself (after having outlet installed in our water closet) but sadly I had to call a plumber b/c my water line was so stiff I couldn't remove it from the toilet- they had to actually cut it & put in a new one so I was bummed to have that extra step & expense, just adding it in here in case others run into this issue- I thought I was just incompetent not being able to get the line off but they assured me there was no way I could have done it without potentially breaking something."
"We did a lot of research before buying this item and its been installed and working now for about two months in my husbands bathroom and he loves it! It received the best reviews on Wirecutter.com which was what led us to select this unit. We did get an electrician to do the installation so although I rated it five starts for installation that is because we hired a professional and he did not have any concerns with the install. One thing to be aware of is that you will need power by the toilet for the bidet unit to plug in. Our electrician was able to run power from the toilet area to the existing power source for the vanity. This unit does have the heated seat feature and in retrospect would probably not use it in the future, its a nice to have but not need to have. We have four bathrooms in our house so we will more than likely get at least two more of the non-heated version for the other bathrooms."
"We had difficulty attaching the seat mounting bracket to our American Standard Cadet toilet. The holes in the toilet were very tight and on the left side the hole in the toilet would not accept the mounting hardware suppled by Toto. We think Toto should have taken into consideration that different toilets may have slightly different size holes where the seat mounts. Toto should have supplied at least two different sizes of the mounting hardware to ensure that the customer could get a good fit.

We resolved this problem by using a piece of rubber tubing around the bolt and fastening it with a hex nut and both a rubber washer and metal flat washer. Seems to be secure.

So far the seat has worked well and we like that there are many adjustments of the functions which allow it to be set to your individual preferences."
"Ok. I know it’s expensive. I know it seems like an odd luxury.

But I must tell you, it saves on toilet paper, it reduces flushed waste paper (in case you are on septic), it’s easily installed, it has a night light, and having a warmed up bottom during those overnight potty visits?

Priceless!"
"I experienced Toto toilets (IYKYK) at a few hotels, and started at looking into getting one for the home. Full Toto toilets are expensive. But then I found this option. All you need is the Toto seat (and a power outlet near the toilet). As far as I can tell, it is no different from the full Toto toilets I experienced in the hotels, except that the seat does not lift up and down remotely. But at less than 1/10 the price."
"I like the washlet… however, in my experience it’s been inconsistent. Sometimes the seat is warm others it’s cold. Same with the water temperature. I read it has something to do with the eco mode setting which I haven’t figured out if I can change, or maybe I got a faulty one. Also the remote does not light up, so it’s not user friendly at night. Definitely has a learning curve. But I’m a little disappointed considering the high price tag."
"I suppose some folks will think you’re an effete snob for wanting/using this bidet. I will just say that after a few uses I am one happy effete snob.
Now the time spent sitting on the Throne is quite the pleasure.
Toto is a super high quality brand all around and this little unit does not disappoint.
And if toilet paper use is a concern, from here on out all you need is a few squares.
I highly recommend it, and your hiney will be very happy!"
Easy to install for someone with limited plumbing knowledge. You must select the shape that fits round or elongated toilet bowls.
"I paid three times this much for my first one ten years ago, and I would do so again. But I’m thrilled I can get one for every bathroom in my home now. You will need power near your toilet, but the plumbing connection and installation are simple.

Be sure to clean the air filter weekly to prevent possible tripping your circuit breaker or burning fuses. In other words if you start noticing the power going out while you are enjoying the seat, simply reach down on the left side and pop out the air filter. Blow the lint out and you’ll be back in business- after you reset your breaker or replace the fuse."
"I hate home projects, but with a Japanese wife, I knew that this was eventually going to be a must buy item. To my relief, I could install it myself with no leaks. Just had to call the electrician to install the proper grounded outlet. These things are so much more civilized than tp"
"tried these before didn't work as advertised, this one does. the hot water lasts long enough, wife agrees. doesn't make you glow but it is better than paper. cant speak to longevity but i bet it lasts a long time appears to be a quality item anyway."
"this bidet seat requires at least 2 inches spacing between the seat mounting screws and the tank - and not all toilets provide this spacing. there is supposed to be a compatibility chart on the toto web site, but i could not find it - and learned after purchase that it will not fit my toilet. caveat emptor."
"Have an older model in our downstairs bathroom. Wife wanted one for the upstairs bathroom. No problem!😀
Easy to install and use. Self cleaning features are better than the older version.
Once you have used the seat, you will realize how much better they are than an old fashioned seat. Amazing how fast you can get used to luxury!"
"This is a replacement for the bidet seat I had. While the features if this one are good, there is one drawback I do not like. The seat does not keep enough warm water for the cleaning function. My other seats had almost unlimited warm water spray time. This one is disappointing and makes you feel hurried."
This is my third bidet toilet seat. The previous Toto was upper level. The only downside to this one is the short length of time before warm water turns to cold. But it is just enough time.
"Initially installed for an elderly family member. Now we all prefer to use this bidet as it is so great!
Multiple settings to adjust spray force, direction and seat and water temperature.
Highly recommend!"
We bought this on a lark. Thought it was an extravagance. Not the case. We don’t how we lived without it. Easy to install and great for personal hygiene.
I have a large midriff. It tends to push the seatback out of the hinges. Do that enough times and it cracks. But the bidet - it's wonderful!
Heated seat is wonderful in the middle of the night
we had no idea what we were missing. the heated seat is so delightful. Warm water pressure cleans well & the remote is very user friendly. Would recommend if you have a handy person to install.
"It's a great product.
After four months of use I highly recommend."
Received my third ordered of the same model. This time I had the UPS witness the item being open. So I can refuse the dwlivery right then and there. The original box was previously open like the second one. The packaging inside was intact and inspected the item and it was in good condition. It took me less than 20 mins to install and test everything and it was working like a champ. Very satisfied with the purchase. I will update as time goes on.
"If you have a power outlet next to your toilet, this is a super easy install (around 10 min). I had to run electrical wires but hopefully you don't need to do that."
See title
This is an awesome bidet and a must to be equipped in all bathrooms. Its hygienic and comfortable to use. Only challenging part was to run an electrical outlet to the toilet as the existing outlets are not nearby the toilet seat. If you are handy then there are many youtube DIY options available. The actual installation of the bidet is super easy and took me less than 10mins to install. Satisfied with the purchase and may buy it again for my other bathrooms
"Wow, I love this. Warms the water, warms the seat, bow dries, so awesome."
"Ok so I don't need to describe in detail what this seat does.

But there is nothing better than a warm seat on a cold day!!!"
"If you ever visit Japan, you will find that every bathroom in hotels and parks use a washlet toilet. I became convinced the first time that I visited Japan about two decades ago, that this was a must have item. Buying one back then in NY was a project since only a few plumbing supply houses carried Toto Washouts. Today, five Toto Washlets later, I have a big house, I am thrilled with this item. Amazon sells these at a very good price, and the product is not to be surpassed. Others now make a washlet, but for my money Toto is the absolute best one on the market. If you never have had one in your home, you are missing out on an item that is superb hygiene-wise, and in almost every other way you use a toilet for. Can you tell that I absolute love it?"
The heated seat is da bomb. Anyone with any mechanical skill at all can easily install this Bidet. The remote is amazing. Highly recommended.
"It looks intimidating, but installation is actually super easy. It works well, it does what it's supposed to do! I especially like that it has a kind of quick-release feature for if you need to remove it from your toilet for cleaning purposes."
I've used several different brands and this is hands down the best seat out as of now
Works great
This was a big hit at Christmas. Everyone likes the heated seat and I have to say I think we’ll be saving a lot of money on toilet paper and on putting too much through our sewage pipes
"can't believe i've waited my whole life to get one of these! high quality, great features. pampering at its best. wish the hot water lasted a little longer, but great value and worth the money!"
"Amazing product love, love, love and highly recommend"
Toto bidet seats are the extra added comfort we all need and deserve. Nothing like sitting on a warm seat and also getting extra clean. Cuts down on the use of toilet paper as well. I just wish it had the auto open and close feature.
"The automated features of this seat are awesome; when a person walks up to it, it opens yet it doesn't open for my dog (3 feet tall; ~60 lbs. He triggers hall motion sensors, which is why it's a concern). However, it seems a bit silly to have the automated bowl night light only trigger when the seat lid opens automatically (and during bidet use/cleaning), and not with the lid + seat open automation. My wife often goes with the seat down so when I had the automation to lift both the lid and the seat, my wife ended up sitting on the porcelain in a rude awakening because the light didn't let her see that the seat was up. And, since the bowl light is only on for around 5-6 seconds, it's like it's challenging men to pee through the seat in the dark, with only the after image of the led glow to guide your aim. Even with it's self cleaning features, these are the sorts of antic that egg divorce, lol

Because these features aren't very adjustable (either on or off) and the price of this item is so high, it might make more sense for people who are looking for these features to buy a 1000$ smart toilet instead. The Eplo DP7 I purchased for my master bath has all of the features this bidet seat has, but additional toilet features like a tankless design, kick flush, high pressure flush, battery backup, UV wand sterilization, ionized flush water, darkness activated night light, etc. Much better deal."
PERFECT. Just in time for my shoulder operation
"I had come across the toto brand at a friends house. I knew I could not upgrade an entire toilet but this wash option was an absolute game changer. My husband looked at me crazy when I suggested getting it but now he brags and will only use the bathroom that has this. He had a very easy time installing it. During the cold months, the warm seat is the best. It definitely does the job."
My wife is handicapped and this is an amazing asset to have.
"I feel like when it comes to bidets, if you know, you know. You’re not reading reviews to be sold on bidets in general, you want to know about this particular bidet.

I’m still learning the ins and outs of all the different features, but this thing is something else. First off, I was a little cautious about the hump in the back since Im tall, but no problems there. You won’t ever notice it’s there sitting on the seat.

There are a few reviews that mention a “manufacturing defect” with the seat - these reviews are wrong. One side of the seat depresses to activate a switch when you sit down. The top leg on that side of the side slopes down as well, there isn’t just a flatter one in the back. It does not feel like you’re leaning sitting down. Do not attempt to “correct” this by putting something under it; I guarantee you’re harming your bidet.

The air dryer doesn’t feel like it does much, but after messing with the settings and not using it at all, it definitely does help at least a little. Don’t expect it to be like a hair dryer intensity or anything.

I like that this model has a tank for heated water, as sometimes the instant heat models draw too much power and make the lights on that circuit flicker. No issues here!

Make sure you take time to read the manual and set it up. You can turn certain features on and off, and you can adjust things that other reviews have mentioned they wished they could adjust.

All in all, I’m really happy so far!"
Liked function
"I was a little skeptical as to whether I really needed this, but, after seeing the recommendation in NYT's WireCutter, I decided to try it. Love it. Makes my life cleaner & more comfortable. It has the unanticipated benefit of reducing the use of toilet paper. Have to note that it took awhile to temper my expectation that it would work instantly. When you press the operation you want on the remote, it takes 10+ seconds for the apparatus to respond. I've gotten use to that. The only complaint I have is that the installation and usage instructions were not well written. Yes, I figured everything out using common sense, but the instructions weren't of much help. Would I buy this again? Unqualified YES."
Super happy with taking a chance to upgrade our toilet seat. The installation was a breeze. The functions are easy to use. The heated toliet seat is worth it alone. The water pressure and length of warm stream is perfect.
"I really like that my butt is washed clean. It wasn't hard to install. I did have an electrician install an outlet near the toilet. It doesn't really dry you. You need to use toilet paper to dry.
I was about to order a second one for another bathroom but will wait a while.
I paid $505 in October and now it is $566!
It was already among the priciest."
I love this
I waned to install myself and I have an american standard toilet with all the hoses covered so there was very little room to get hoses in place under toilet wish they would have included alternative hook up to wall shut off valve area.. ALSO I THOUGHT LID WOULD AUTO OPEN AND CLOSE NO NOT on this unit. but so hard to install I dont want to uninstall return and upgrade
"Love this product, superior clean. I wished I would have bought this sooner. Highly recommend!"
"Got one of these to fit to our existing Toto 'elongated' skirted toilet. Turns out these are not so easy to plumb into a skirted Toto - you need to get a 6"" extension hose, to extend the downward connection from under the cistern/water tank. Unless you have the hands and dexterity of a 6 year old, that involves draining and removing the cistern/ tank, not too difficult, but then you'll want new fixing bolts w their washers, and a new Toto 9BU062E, to connect it all back up. Best not to re-use the old ones for water-tight fix. Once that was done it was not a difficult install of the actual seat, although of course, all these extra parts adds to the cost and effort of plumbing it in.

Managed to do all this, and love the unit - feel much cleaner, as many here say. It's very clever and works well.

One other thing is: its not an especially attractive unit - looks a bit like a 'special needs' toilet or something with that angled back. Inevitable given the need for a wand and water tank to be integrated into there. Just check that everyone in your household is on board with the look of this thing. Someone who's got a very 'styled' bathroom may object to its appearance. That said, even the high end Toto integrated units, (rather than separate Washlet seats) have the same angled seat. Personally I'm happy. As long as we get a few good years of service out of it, I feel its very worthwhile."
"Just opened the package, saw some pieces in the plastic bag, then saw the corner was broken. What should we do?"
"I do like this. It does a great job of getting my bottom feeling very clean. The warm seat is also nice in the winter.
That said, there are things that I don’t think it does well. It does not clean my front side without me doing acrobatics to aim it in the right location. I also find the the dryer on it doesn’t work very well"
"I avoided installing this for a month, but it was easy. YOU NEED AN OUTLET right next to the toilet. We did not have one and had to run an extension cord.

Love the warmth and cleanliness. Easy controls. Like the presets you can have for two person. Both men and women in our family like it."
"When I first installed it, I was worried that it was too big, but it is fantastic. We’ve had bidets since 2020, but this really was a terrific upgrade until we replace the entire toilet."
"Typical Chinese instructions. Lot of pictures, but without explanation where needed. One missing part, but not needed for my installation."
"Love it. What used to be dread in the mornings are now warm and inviting, thanks to the heated seat. I have no problem with the water pressure or position (male). If I could make two suggestions, it would be to allow more water for a longer, warmer rinse, and to automatically oscillate. Or at least attach oscillation to the user setting. Some say one can simply stand up to stop the water flow, but I have not been brave enough to attempt this."
"I haven't tried other bidets to be able to compare this to. Friends have a Tushy and love it. I was hesitant to get something that wasn't heated, and seemed to have limited adjustability. I settled on a Toto after reading reviews and haven't regretted it.

We recently had a bathroom redone. I've convinced myself that the contractor undersized the new baseboard heater, and that the room doesn't get warm as it use to in winter. But having a heated toilet seat makes up the difference. Also surprising noticeable...the air filter/purifier! I haven't smelled a turd or fart or asparagus pee in that bathroom since the bidet went in. Warm water, heated drier, wand adjustments, it all fantastic. I've have a couple complaints:

1) It looks ""almost"" too small for the elongated bowl it's on. Could be that I installed it slightly too far back. Could be that it's just a little small. It's a visual/aesthetics preference, not a functionality issue, and not a big enough bother that I've tried to adjust it.

2) It has some side-to-side play. Not enough that I think it's going to fall off, but more than I'd expect for something at this price range. Like the size issue, maybe it's user error and I didn't install the base tight enough. Could that the seat portion is detachable from the base and a little bit of play is to be expected on something with such a small attachment. I've really only noticed it while cleaning, not while using.

After using this for about 6 months, it feels medieval using toilets without a bidet. I'm on team bidet now and think everyone should have one, even if just a basic unit. In retrospect, I would have been fine with something cheaper. Cold water isn't jarring like I thought it would be. Most guests say they didn't adjust it from the default position, so sliding forward/backwards on the seat a little may be all the adjustability needed. With that all said, the bells and whistles are really nice to have, and I've been thinking about getting another Toto for the 2nd bathroom. I'm not even hesitant to check out the higher end models. If you can splurge, I say go for it!"
Easy to install. Clever design. Dramatically reduces tissue use. Luxurious personal care item.
"A little disappointed with this Toto C5 washlet. Being a user of Toto C200 washlet for about 7 years I expected similar if not better performance from the new C5 model. The functionality and quality is
about the same as the old C200. A major difference though is weaker water stream. The highest level
of water pressure (5 bars) of C5 equals in my estimation to the middle lever (3 bars) of C200.
I contacted TOTO and their response confirmed my impression. The water spray volumes for C5 are lower
than the ones for C200. Ironically the manual included with the new unit and dated 2020 listed exactly the same numbers for water flows as the one for the old unit dated 2014.
the old one"
"Prior to the Toto I had a Brondell Swash, which I loved. After 3 yrs the only thing that worked was the heated seat. So I decided to try a different brand.
Toto vs Brondell
Toto flimsier toilet seat top. You could sit in the Brondell seat although it is not recommended.
Toto pre wash and deodorizer nice touch.
Brondell is heavier duty. The water flow seems stronger probably b/c it pulled more electricity.
The Brondell would blow the fuse about once every 8 days or so. Granted my house is over 100 yrs old and the wiring isn’t the best. No such problems with the Toto.
The Brondell has a stainless wand which they say is Rust resistant. It isn’t but that wasn’t a huge deal.
Oh and the Brondell has a nightlight, but I never used it, so it wasn’t a deal breaker.
All in all I really like the Toto but find it comparable with Brondell."
Used one it Japan and wanted one ever since. You won't be disappointed.
"It takes care of your personal needs and is warm. There are a number of sprays that can be used. Always nice to sit on a warm toilet seat, too. When you are done with the sprays you have a nice warm dryer. So happy with this prodct!!! Would highly recommend!!! 🤗"
Excellent working product but the seat is a little small. I would check the dimensions prior to ordering. Elongated yes but maybe not enough.
"Takes a while to get the hang of, but works really well once you have it all set up. Make sure you buy the correct size, I mistakenly bought the elongated version and it doesn’t fit very well.

It’s very bulky as well so I wouldn’t install it in a small bathroom."
"If you are thinking about trying a bidet, this one is great. The price is reasonable for the features and after about 2 months it seems like a solid product. I recommend it to family and friends."
Do you really want to be sitting on this when uprising of the machines begins??
Works well. Fairly easy to install. Front side of remote is easy to use. Prefer different remote with LCD screen on back side of remote. This on works ok with audible beeps to indicate settings but no visual image.
This was a life saver for 2.5 years. I have lichen sclerosus and so loved this. Then it just stopped working. For the price I paid I expected it to last longer than 2.5 years.
Easy to install and works as advertised but not as well as I had hoped. Warm water is very limited. Instructions are not adequate. If I were to purchase again I would be more careful in my selection. That said I am still glad I have made the purchase. I have severe health issues and this helps keep me independent.
"I had another brand when I lived overseas. This time purchased TOTO I was hoping the futures better, they’re really not but the price a lot higher, I paid for the name. After made the purchase few days Amazon had a price drop, not happy."
"Installed this for a renovation project (flip for sale) just to see what the reaction would be. Turns out everyone loves a heated toilet seat and bidet! Buyers absolutely loved it and it resulted in me purchasing one for my own home. It’s pretty easy to install (make sure the water connection is done properly) and functions as it should … once you learn the controls. My only gripe is with the remote. It’s not particularly intuitive, so it takes a minute to get used to. Other than that, this is a great addition to the bathroom and I regret not getting one sooner."
This is an okay Bidet. The one I had at my old house didn’t empty water during the night. This one does so not sure I like this one as much
"The Toto 3408#01 arrived in perfect condition, worked as described in the instruction manual, and so far has operated with no problems....one tiny complaint, it doesn't come close to cleaning adequately. There would need to be much greater water pressure to eliminate the need for toilet paper. I don't think the unit is defective in any way in the sense that it works as designed. The design is simply inadequate to the task. This has been quite a disappointment after the effort and expense that was required to provide electrical service to the site."
"Without going into too much detail, it’s a game-changer!! I would buy it a thousand times over! Easy installation for my handy husband."
Ease of use
You won't regret for having one of this product! It makes your down and under happy and comfort!
"Others have said it well: this is a huge convenience when it comes to personal cleaning and comfort. Women and older folks will appreciate it especially. Not great for young kids or visitors, so perhaps keep it to a bathroom that primarily serves the adults. We chose this model as best bang for our budget - your mileage may vary."
"I decided it was time in my life to get the best. I'm sure a less expensive model would be just fine for anyone, including myself, but I am happy with this one. You really don't need warm water, heated seat, so many settings, etc. etc. But it's nice.
I don't even use toilet paper anymore (eco-friendly!) because I keep a basket of small towels within hand's reach to pat myself dry afterwards, then toss the towel into the laundry."
"I had been Jonesing for one of these for quite some time, so finally I ordered one and really like it. It cleans up very well, so much better than toilet paper, it is that effective. I just thought I would share some thoughts about the product. Installation wasn't difficult at all. My unit ended up being an inch from the tank. I know that Toto says it needs 2 inches, but I guess it all depends on the shape of the tank. The business end of the product overlaps the bowl by about 2/5, so that means that if you are a guy and are standing up, you have to aim a little more intentionally toward the available real estate. Because of how the lid and seat are attached to the machine, they are very high profile and the lid sticks up above the vanity next to it by about 7 inches. You just gotta get used to it. As for usage, the remote is okay, but sometimes a little hard to figure out. One thing that bothers me is that a few of the options don't confirm your selection with a red light. The tank has a quantity of hot water that can run out quickly. For me, that is a reminded to finish up, but if you want unlimited hot water then choose one that offers it. The deodorizing fan is surprisingly effective; I don't know the science of it but it seems to work. I turned on the energy saver to begin at 11 pm. Last night in the middle of the morning I got up and somehow touched the product in such a way that it woke up and ended the energy saver mode. I don't remember what I did, but this sorta started me, but next time I will just be ready for it."
Really like the clean feel after toilet trip. Nice features. Just don't like the feel that the incline near the back of the seat causes. I think there is a reservoir for the warm water there and the warm water is nice. Just miss the more level feel of the old seat.
"Seat makes you lean forward and is very small compared to a traditional elongated seat - actual opening is much closer in size to a small round seat. Ironically, this makes it challenging to do the business that this product is designed to be used for."
"Remodeled my bathroom and decided to go all out. This is an excellent product. It shrinks the usable opening of a elongated toilet a bit, but the features of the seat more than make up for it.

If you install this and have a leak shut down the water, take apart the seat joint and reseat it slowly but firmly before screwing it in. Once right it will not leak."
"A bit of a learning curve on using the remote, but it’s a really good bidet seat! The seat is always warm & the jet works perfectly. Very happy with my purchase."
"This product works great, no question. However, there are some rather expensive preparations that I had to make for this toilet seat to work. First, I had to hire an electrician to install a 110 plug near the toilet. Since this unit draws a lot of power, this had to be on it's own circuit far removed from the breaker panel, $$$. Then I had to have the toilet removed and replaced with an elongated bowl unit, $$$. Once both of those expensive alterations were made to my bathroom, installation of the seat was a breeze."
"Wanted so badly to love this device and have it change my life like it has so many others reported here. And that is exactly how I felt for 24 hours until the washing wand failed to emerge and spray. Alas, no amount of rebooting, re-checking, analysis, and head scratching, has remedied my beautiful, toilet seat. I will pack it up and return it, with a heavy heart. I guess I will be returning to my conventional, pedestrian water, , closet, routine."
"I waited a long time to buy this simply because it was a big purchase. Now that I finally got it I regret not getting it sooner.
It's easy to install and we solved for the power issue by buying an extension cord and adhesive wall clips to make the wire look neat.
Don't let the lack of outlet stop you from getting this."
"First, let me get the complaints out of the way first: 1) it's cheap plastic. For the price, I really wish this was a bit more heavier-duty in terms of build. Despite being packaged well, we had a corner chipped off en route. Not enough to warrant the time/effort to return and was fixable with a bit of super glue but it would be nice to see some heavier duty construction. 2) the electrical cable is really short. In our case, the outlet is on the left side of our toilet but the cable comes out the right-side of the seat. It barely reached our outlet. So, it works, but could definitely be a foot longer to make things easier for people.

Now that that is out of the way, the good: It's a really really great thing to have. I wish I had purchased this a decade earlier. Once you figure out the options (there are a lot on the remote) it's pretty easy to use. And really a joy to use. You don't know how nice having some warm water splashed up your back side is until you use one of these. So much better than toilet paper.

The heater is nice and gives you at least 30-seconds of nice warm water which is more than enough most of the time. We don't use the air-dryer that much (easier to just use a tiny bit of TP) but is a nice feature to have for those that want or need it. Overall, we're very happy with this product."
"Toto, please come back soon. You were only here a few months, but It was love at first spray. Every day I could get up eagerly, wanting to feel your warm seat against me. Like everyone, I fell in love with our Toto C5, and so did my wife. We were so happy, the three of us. So I did it - I bought a second C5, identical, for the other bathroom.
Then it happened. We had a power outage in the middle of the night. The next morning it came back on. But alas, Toto wasn’t all there. Yes, the lights were on, but the wand didn’t appear, the water never came out. I ran to the other bathroom, desperately. No, it couldn’t be. Both were broken in the exact same way!
Devastated, I monkeyed with the remote, tried rebooting it, and searched the Internet for an answer. Nothing. As soon as Toto customer service woke up, I called. The guy was nice enough. But as soon as I told him about the power outage, he grew serious. “Oh. That.”
So now I have to send them back to the factory. Both of them. After two months of blissful romance, they are leaving me. For such a stupid reason - a power outage. Why would they send these lovely creatures out into the world without surge protection?
“Run, Toto, run”, said Dorothy. I feel the same way. But please come back soon. I miss you."
"A life changer, great bidet"
"I don't know why Americans are not more into bidets. We all have to use the toilet and it's important to take care of your rear. They keep you clean and avoid ""polished anus syndrome"" which is a real thing. Irritation from wiping too much.
Toto is the RollsRoyce of bidets and this is a nice model. Has a lot of bells and whistles but isn't $1000. It has about everything a more expensive one has except it does not automatically open/close the lid. I can deal with that.
It was easy to install. You just need a plug nearby
I like the remote. I attached it to the wall at a location comfortable for me. It comes with double sided tape."
"I didn't review this item until one year later. Like most of reviewers of this item, my family is very happy about it. But when I purchase the second Toto bidet toilet seat, I chose the model without the remote control. The remote control is nice and handy, however, once someone misplace it, it is hard to find."
"I have used washlet over three decades. It is just comfortable and requisite for us. Once accustomed, so difficult to return back to the days without it. This model is the latest one we bought from Amazon.

Installation was pretty easy except wiring the power cable. Ideally you have to set an outlet just behind the toilet but each home and apartment has different requirements. I believe this is not recommended but I have no other option but to use an extended cable from an outlet in the bathroom and protect the connection from water by using a plastic case. The cables are also covered by plastic covers for cable. Actually those planning and work took majority of time when installing washlet.

As for features and functionality, the control is the latest model, easy and nice, but not with automatic toilet cover open and close. I have used those before, while visually impressive at first, its practical benefits are not large. Too much to say it is just a gimmick but nice to have not must have.

The practical functions and how it works are just as good as other latest washlets. You must not be dissatisfied and disappointed.

One caveat is as many mentioned the amount of continuous hot water. It helps in reducing power consumption thus ecological, but a long time of usage at once makes you feel not so water after initial comfortable warmness.

I can add a couple of things. How long can hot water last? In my case around 50 seconds with medium water strength. Do I need usually as long as that? No. But this is not universal and people have different preferences. Moreover it may depend on the frequency of access by family members. So there is no one size fits all answers but in our case this has never been a major pushback against the model we use."
"Didn’t know I needed a warm toilet seat until I had one 😄. After experiencing toilet seats in Japan, I thought I would splurge on this one during Prime Days. It came, it was easily installed, and it conquered. Its functions all work well and now I wonder how we ever got along without one."
"We already have and enjoy two Toto Washlets. But we recently moved into a new rental home, and neither Washlet fits the one-piece ""French curve"" toilet upstairs.

I personally did not feel that we needed to spend 80+ dollars on a ""travel Washlet"" (I rallied instead for a less-expensive bidet spray-hose, to be hooked up directly to our plumbing). And, for my own part(s), I actually already travel with the Hygienna Solo ""portable bidet,"" a plastic nozzle that screws into any water bottle. It is discreet and useful, and it set me back about ten bucks or so.

My husband did not agree with my financial priorities, however. He finally blurted that he found the plastic water bottle + nozzle rig to be ""uncivilized,"" ""undignified,"" and ""okay if you're going camping.""

In short, I was bullied into purchasing this Toto travel Washlet.

It's very nice. I refuse to say that it's 70-something-dollars more effective than a manual travel bidet. But it's designed very well and there's no feeling of ""making a mess"" in operating it. As with all Toto products, the ""look"" of the product is one of serene cleanliness, which is reassuring in its special Toto way. Subtle little aesthetic touches really do evoke the Toto Washlet toilet seat's own distinctive design (the nozzle itself really does look like your little pal from home!), which is sure to please devotees of the genuine article.

I showed my husband how it works. There's a reservoir that telescopes out of the main body of the travel Washlet, to be refilled before each use. When not in use, the nozzle-sprayer tucks and folds tidily against the Washlet, and then the whole apparatus ""turtles"" back inside the reservoir, nice and neat and clean. (I might not be comfortable refilling it in public like I am with a plain water bottle, but for private use, no big deal.) It isn't really a novel design, except for probably the nozzle itself.

My husband laughed and brought out his electric water pick, which he uses to floss his teeth, and we marveled because the two have the exact same design and work the exact same way. The Toto travel Washlet is, in fact, nothing more than a water pick for your butt.

The real proof, however, is in the ""last swipe"" of toilet tissue: the ""white glove test,"" if you will. I begrudgingly admit that this automatic, battery-operated bidet works very, very well — again, perhaps not 70-something-dollars better than the cheapest alternative, but certainly well enough. It's definitely a ""nice-to-have,"" a creature-comfort for those of you who, like my husband and I do, actually become *homesick* for your heated toilet seat anytime you travel. And it really is much simpler and easier to use than a manual, hand-operated travel bidet.

I do dread the panic we'll experience when we run out of AA batteries in the night but, for now, our bottoms are clean, and we can rest easy."
"I've just returned from a three week trip in Europe. I used this device daily. It's compact, light, solid, and works so well I'd use it for home daily use if I didn't have a Toto seat top washlet. It's spray is fine for cleaning me, and it doesn't get soiled in use, though I give it a light soap down and rinse every time just in case. Very little effort is needed to set it up and fill with water, use, and re-pack. One battery lasted 15 days of regular use, and then I replaced it just in case. The specs indicate 50 hours of run time per battery, but that seems impossible. However, I could have left the first battery in just to see. For a month's trip for one person I'd recommend one spare AA alkaline battery, and no more. The storage bag has a tough plastic opener for the battery cover, so no coins are ever needed to unscrew the cap, which is sealed and waterproofed, as is the whole unit.

Toilet paper just isn't needed, except for maybe a little pat down to dry yourself after cleaning. Much of the world beyond the nice hotels can't deal with toilet paper in the sewer system, and this is the solution to that problem. I tended to use one refill per use, and a water bottle makes that simple. Its noise is too minor for concern unless you're really, really shy.

If toilet paper is a pain for you to use, then just buy this thing."
"Very compact little device: you pull out the reservoir from the main unit in order to fill it, and you manually fold out the retractable wand. It is very quick and easy to pull out both parts and then flip everything back into place when done. The reservoir may be filled in either a deep or shallow sink (the reservoir door is angled to allow the latter). There are two pressure settings, low and high. To me, both offer a good amount of water pressure; the high setting is actually a bit much for me. The aim from the wand is precise, and the reservoir seems to hold enough water to do the job without needing to refill (this may vary depending on your preferences). Overall, I think this is a great, nifty little device that's easy to use and that gets the job done well!"
Great device for posterior pleasure.
"I purchased this product in May 2022. The motor stopped working in October 2022, 5 months later. You cannot reach anyone for customer support. Toto is a good brand for your home, but purchase a cheaper model for your portable needs. It’s overpriced and you’re out $100 when it breaks."
"I recently had to have surgery in that ""region"" and have never been more grateful for a product's invention. It works perfectly and is easy to use. Fill it with warm water and go. I love the Toto toilets, but we have an apartment and couldn't install one. But this works fine as an alternate and has the benefit of portability. It's the perfect ergonomic size. Just the right amount of water. The pressure is fine for me. I would have purchased this a long time ago if I had known such a smart invention existed. I chose this over the others because Toto specializes in these products. I made the right choice. Regarding cost, it's not the least expensive, but the benefits by far outweigh the costs for me.

Oh, and regarding the seller. They were great. I needed my product in time for my surgery. For some reason I did not receive it and they overnighted me a replacement no questions asked. Great customer service."
"I expected more from Toto

On the positive side, it does the job (barely), which is why I gave it 3 stars

This product has a large number of minor faults which should have been eliminated through the years...

1) It looks and feels flimsy (reminds me of Japanese toys built 30 years ago), does not look like a $100 product

2) The pressure is really low. Understandable since it is powered by a single AA battery. But given the price of the product it should have have a more powerful, integrated, rechargeable battery with a charging stand

3) The amount of water stored is not enough... I would like to refill it, which makes it unsuitable for a public toilet (without a basin attached)

4) It is too bulky to carry in one's pocket. On the other hand, when filled with water it is pretty large (think of going to a public toilet carrying this in one's hand, filling it in the basin, carrying this bulky object to one of the stalls, guaranteed to collect many stares). This is essentially a woman's product to be carried in a handbag to a toilet.

5) The carrying strap is terribly designed. It tends to drop into the water stream and get wet. (I removed the strap)

6) When you press the button (and water starts spraying), the lock tends to disengage and the device starts collapsing (making the button inaccessible... and this stops operation)

7) All instructions on the device are in Japanese. (On the flip side, it is not complicated to figure out)

In Conclusion: I expected far better engineering and design. However it gets the job done... barely"
"Why didn't I get this years ago? It's fantastic. If you have any type of condition (as I do) that causes you to poo multiple times a day, and you find yourself getting raw while traveling from that lovely cardboard toilet paper in your hotel/office, then you will absolutely love this little device. It's compact, portable, discreet, and washes you right up with a single fill. It doesn't have a warmer built in, so the only drawback is that you need to wait for warm water from the tap, but that's a very minor complaint. Well constructed, solid, runs forever on battery. Worth it."
I was happy to travel but so sad about leaving my Toto toilet. Then I found this little gem and it saved my trip. Once you use a Toto you never feel clean using just dry tp. This does a great job and it’s easy to use. I love it!
"I ordered this portable bidet at the onset of quarantine and haven't looked back since. The reservoir holds just enough water (and for some BMs it's far more than enough), and the 2-level adjustable pressure is definitely appreciated as well. I've only ever used this at home, so I can't speak to the experience of traveling with it or using it in public spaces. I imagine it'd take some self confidence as the whole ordeal is pretty noisy - definitely not for the poop-shy among us.

As the title of this review states, I strongly recommend using rechargeable batteries for this thing. I started off with standard, cheapo dollar store batteries and in no time I could hear the motor struggling to pump out as much water as it did when the thing was at full charge. The device is really only as good as the power it's given, so take the extra step to use batteries that you can top up every now and then to keep the washlet useful."
"OUT OF WARRANTY ISSUE ADDRESSED PROMPTLY
You can Trust TOTO to stand behind their products. I asked for help on an OUT OF WARRANTY ISSUE and was immediately assisted in a professional and courteous manner. Most companies would have declined my request. TOTO immediately worked within their system and provided the support I needed with NO ADDITIONAL EXPENSE to me. TOTO has exceeded my expectation for Customer Support and I recommend that everyone choose TOTO above any brand trying to compete with them. TOTO is simply the best!"
"You can't go wrong with Toto. Great design and engineered very well. Works flawlessly and simple to use. My only complaint is that it's kind of big or bulky. Fully extended is about 10 inches (without the cleaning wand extended). It's hard (for a guy) to sneak this thing into the bathroom. Plus the color is not gender neutral. Toto should make two seperate ones, for woman (current color) and man (like white, brushed aluminum, brush stain-less steal, or chrome). Besides that complaint, the travel washlet/bidet works great. Very hygienic. Until America wakes up and realize how better and clean we can be and have bidet in every bathroom, this travel washlet/bidet will work great until then. FYI, I have a Jap/American bidet at home and when I had to use a public restroom, I didn't realize how important /great having a bidet is. So I implore everyone to try the new bidets that are coming out. Let's get American's bathrooms in the 21st century."
"Being European I'm used to bidets, and since I can't take the one from my house along to the office, etc. this does the job really well.

Note: In a bathroom where there are no full walls between the stalls, people in other stalls will know that something out of the ordinary is going on in your stall! ;-) It's not loud, but it's loud enough in the quiet of a bathroom. So in the U.S. [many] other people might think you're weird, but personally I don't care. :-D

A TIP: The pump works against vacuum in the water chamber. Hence, if you pop the lid when you start using the washlet, the stream is a lot stronger, even when the battery is no longer at its prime.

A STORY: Some time ago a TSA agent at one major U.S. airport pulled my carry-on after scanning the bag, unzipped the side-compartment, pulled out my TOTO washlet, and said: ""What do we have here?"" I replied: ""It's.. well.. a toiletry item"". The TSA agent shoved it back into the bag, zipped the compartment, and reached for hand sanitizer. :D :D"
"I am a committed fan of Toto's washlets. In addition to the several installed in my house, I have installed 2 more as gifts and they have all performed faithfully, as designed, for years of daily use. The challenge was finding a portable version and this Toto product seemed ideal. It is very easy to carry, collapsible and of good quality. However, the battery power is low and, when combined with a very limited water volume...well sorry Toto engineers, but please consider this review as a request for some improvement.

This travel washlet works, and until Toto comes out with an improved model, this is probably the ""best"" option. However, my review is meant to keep expectations at a realistic level. There was some trade off between weight, size and power and some recalculation is needed for the next version."
"I have a Toto Washlet in my house, and I have gotten very used to it. It is fantastic and makes life a lot simpler and, er, cleaner. When I travel, I miss it and often have to carry around disposable cloths or something similar to address the problem. This device sort of addresses the problem, but I feel that the water volume is simply not enough to do the job. Part of the problem is aim - by the time I figure out where to aim, much of the water is gone. If I used it more, it would probably be less of an issue, but that fact is that it can take a lot of practice figuring out how to hold the darn thing - not a problem with the full size toilet, to be sure.

My other problem was that I bought this particular device because I thought I was getting the American model with English instructions. Alas, it is all in Japanese. I might as well have bought the cheaper one...."
"For someone with hemorrhoids and allergies to preservatives (like benzalkonium chloride) in some wet wipes and witch hazel pads, I gave this device a try. There is a very short period of adjustment where you need to learn how to aim the device, but after 2-3 tries your placement of the spray will be fine. It does make some noise (like an electric toothbrush or carving knife) so there would be no possibility to use it discretely in a public washroom -- unless you really didn't care. This is much gentler on inflamed tissues and does a good job of cleaning the nooks and crannies you can't even see. I do use it a couple times just to be sure everything is flushed away, followed by dabbing with tissues and drying with warm air. Then, any creams could be applied, if needed. I believe it has helped considerably and I'm glad I purchased it."
"I have a TOTO washlet at home, and wanted something portable for travel. This portable washlet works just as well with just enough water and pressure. I have taken it with me on several trips, and It was worth every penny. I have not had any issues with leaking or malfunction. Very easy to use, and I have had some issues after having two kids which is a must for me to have. TOTO is also a very excellent brand for toilets and their washlets which is the reason I purchase this with trust in their products. Very happy with my purchase, and I have had it for over two years without any issues with the product. Very durable!!!"
There is a perpetual cool breeze where the sun used to not shine and I am in heaven. This product will change your life. It goes directly for that spot that needs attention and doesn't mist the whole thing like others do. Simple and effective directly to the point... the brown point. I'm sorry. I had to.
"Great product, I purchase two about six months ago. Almost no need for Toilet paper, but we do still use some. Right away we feel cleaner after each use. I think the 3-hole setting works best for us. We sometimes refill it twice per bathroom visit. Battery life is decent too. I use about two batteries per month per unit. I like it so much I am going to install a Bidet in my home at some point in time. Bidet's should be a standard for all new homes built in the USA. We will never go back to using TP only."
"I'm so happy to have discovered this product. I had Duravet washlet toilet seats in my house for a couple of years and got quite used to the benefits of a washlet and not wiping with toilet paper. We recently sold the house and I really missed the washlet. I had a Bodell travel one in which you squeeze the bottle. It was OK for the occasional travel. The Toto, on the other hand, is almost the same experience as the toilet seat. I find that the water reservoir holds just the right amount. The push button electric activation is easy and delivers a consistent stream of water. When the water runs out, I'm perfectly clean. As long as the product holds up, I think I'll be happy with it for a long time."
"I wanted to believe in this thing. I always have some kind of bidet contraption in every bathroom at home, so the idea of taking it with me was attractive.

Bottom line: a bidet is all about water pressure and flow, and this has neither

There was a water gun company called Entertech that made motorized squirt guns that were not all that different from what this does, only they didn't cost over 100 dollars.

These are weak enough that the best they can do is just give you some closure after toilet paper has done all of the heavy lifting. This can be nice, but you can get the same feeling with more effective results if you just wet some toilet paper or use baby wipes. It's far less embarrassing than carrying a vibrator-sized motor-containing contraption into a toilet stall.

This runs on a single AA battery and definitely achieves impressive flow for the power input. This would need to have some kind of lithium ion battery to be truly effective, but at that point would you feel like explaining to airline security why you require that 40V 4.0Ah battery for your posterior?"
"My husband thought I was crazy when I bought a bidet toilet seat (Alpha bidet), but is now addicted to the thing. (Cleanliness is addictive)...anyway, when we were going on a 2 week cruise he jokingly said he would really miss the bidet. After reading the positive reviews I surprised him with it for his birthday, almost as a joke. Well, no joke here, he said it works wonderfully and thinks it's a brilliant product. Even when I told him the cost (about $100), he said it was well worth the price."
"I've had my washlet for a week and I love it. I wish I'd bought it several years ago when I first started needing additional cleaning efforts. It's worth the added cost to get the Toto brand. My plumber tells me that Toto toilets, although expensive to purchase, are the best buy over the long run because they need so few repairs. I think the same is true for this washlet. It's sturdy, as it needs to be. At least once daily I fill it with water, extend the nozzle and use the full tank of water. Perhaps this will cause it to break eventually, but not as soon as a flimsier one would. I keep mine in a tissue box on the lid of the toilet."
"We just got back from a vacation at an eco-friendly hotel in Tulum, Mexico, where one was requested not to flush used toilet paper. If that thought is as repulsive to you or your traveling companion, if any, as it is to me, this device can help a lot. Use first, less messy toilet paper to put in the garbage pail. It is not a miracle worker. The spray is not particular forceful. The capacity is good for about 20 seconds, and the device is difficult to refill unless you have a pitcher with a spout or are next to your sink (we had neither). But I still recommend it as it works and is a lot better than nothing. When empty and collapsed it can be carried into a public bathroom fairly discreetly."
"I am honestly IN LOVE WITH THIS ITEM!

I have bidet attachments in all of my bathrooms... I like being clean & fresh ... so being out & not having that available is always unfortunate. Until NOW!!! I wasn’t sure if it would’ve any good but I figured for the price it better work well! Also, Toto is a highly regarded company so I took a chance.
WORTH EVERY PENNY!!! At least to me! I am thrilled and now EVERY time I use a public restroom I get to leave feeling properly clean! KUDOS TOTO!"
"It works like a dream! I have a medical condition where I am always running to the toilet and nothing is worse than having to go when on the go! With this I am able to stay (relatively) clean and happy when I'm out and about.

Since I go more than the usual person, wiping is definitely not an option for me. With the TOTO I am able to have the clean feel and not have to deal with any skin excoriation.

One thing to note is that I have to bring a bottle of water with me as one wash is usually not enough for me. Though it gets 80 - 90% of the job done, if you're having loose motion then you might need a 2nd ""wash"". It still is better than wiping though!"
"Functions well.

OK, it is not 3 litres per minute flow at 2 to 3 bar pressure but it is a hand portable unit!. GOOD JOB!

Remember to bring your water bottle with you if you are doing number 2 (back side) ;-)
The reservoir is good for portable ""work"". Great for ""lady fresh"" cleaning buTT not for a clean bum.
Used two fills for a good ""rearing"" LOL.

Great unit. Good performance. Compact for travel. Only one battery - economical. Two flow settings on nozzle."
"The first one of these I bought was wonderful. It lasted about 3 years before the motor finally gave out. When I replaced it with a second one, it started cracking and leaking at the top of the reservoir within about 3 months. The problem was that it had no air intake, creating excessive pressure in the reservoir. It started with one crack in the side near the top of the reservoir (crack in photo approximately 1-1/2"" long), then a second crack at the hinge side, and, finally, a third on the opposite side, creating leaks at all three locations. Thinking it was simply a problem with one, I purchased a replacement. But the same thing happened. This is waaaaayyy too expensive not to have that tiny hole in the top of the reservoir as every other closed liquid container has (check your large detergent container with the intake at the back or your average non-squeeze water bottle). I will not purchase another one, so I'm looking now for an alternative."
"This product is amazing! I took it with me to Burning Man since it's a serious porta-potty situation and you cannot throw even flushable wipes into them - TP only. So this little gem worked like a charm! Everyone I showed it to was amazed and many of them will be ordering one for next year's Burn. There are two settings for the water stream force you want and it amazingly runs on 1 battery. It's light, easy to travel with, and was a lifesaver. This made my experience so much better and I would definitely recommend this product. In fact, I already have and it was quite the buzz in my camp!"
"I should've spent the extra money to buy this from the start, instead I bought a cheaper brand that turned out to be totlly useless with no pressure! This Toto Portable Bidet is amazing, it collapsed into a neat little package, yet when extended and filled it provides excellent water pressure to clean you nicely. I recommend carrying a water bottle with you in case you need more cleaning."
"I carry this in my briefcase, and use it whenever I am away from home. The water flow is not as strong as an installed Washlet and does not eliminate the need for toilet paper. But it is better than nothing, and, when used with toilet paper, will clean you. I never feel clean with just toilet paper, so I value this little machine."
During the pandemic we installed Toto washlets and now I cannot do without washlet. This one works great on trips and for days away from home. Highly recommended.
"This dandy item with a wrist strap does a great job. Even if your grip is weak,it is easy to hold, direct to the affected areas, and is easy to clean. A+++ I find the reservoir to be adequate, but if you like, you could carry a small water bottle with you and refill it if you want an extra rinse cycle."
"I have a bidet at home (why doesn't everyone?), so like to have something for the road as well! It does OK, but not the greatest, kind of weak stream that doesn't always do the job as needed let's say. The manual one you push actually gets more, um...""power""? After looking around there's a much more powerful one for more money, but looks like it would be so much better."
"Overall use is excellent but sometimes you need to refill 2 or 3 times to really get your butt clean. The spray power is pretty good and it goes far enough to any direction. I think that it is a very nice product and it also comes with a great pouch. Battery life is so far so good, and I would recommend this to anybody that feels uncomfortable using tissue wipes. The only downsides are the small size of the water tank and the whirring noise it makes while spraying. But besides that, excellent product."
"Wonderful and better than expected! I am planning a round the world trip and with the variances in tp available in different countries I was anxious to give this a try. I just think it is perfect and would not change a thing. Yes, I do need to fill it twice sometimes, but the trade off for me is the small size and weight - 8.9 oz. Also it was very easy for my smallish hand to hold. It feels very solid and well built."
"Not to be graphic, but not quite as powerful as you might want sometimes"
"The water needs a little more force when squirting out, is why the 3 stars. I like the wand that pulls out of the unit and the slider that controls the stream force of the water (high-low), the force needs to be adjusted on the manufacturer level. It's the right size, right angle, comes with a soft case for travel.

I use cold water .... yikes! lol"
This works well. I’ve been using these for over 10 years. Toilet paper can irritate and water is soothing. Have recommended to many friends. The pumps last for years and after using 2 to 3 times a day. Highly recommend. Doesn’t leak. Travels easily.
I bought it for my trip this holiday and it is wonderful to have. I didn't want to be in the mercy of random toilet paper at people's house and so this was very handy. It is not awkward to hold and use at all. In a guy and I hold the device from the front and I get a pretty constant good stream of warm water for 20 seconds or so. Just hang it up to dry.
"It does what is suppose to do, but the same as my ""Boulder Bidet - Portable Travel Hiking Backpaking Bidet"". It doesn't have much pressure at all. I rather pay less from my Boulder Bidet that does the same, probably won't last as much (who knows), but for the price I can buy several and be ahead.
It felts the same pressure, not a single difference."
"This was intended to replace an abysmal manual squirt-bottle bidet that I'd been using, and while it does give a better experience than that, it is still nowhere near as powerful as the GoBidet I use at home, which attaches to the water main. Thus, I end up using toilet paper to do most of the work and finish up with this, which is better than nothing."
Well made and no more hemorrhoids.
"Works like a charm! I spent 6 weeks traveling through the South this last winter & very much appreciated the Toto Washlet. However, I quickly got onto packing a Styrofoam or plastic drinking cup from the motel into my luggage along with the Washlet as not all motel vanity faucets are tall enough to allow you to easily fit the Washlet under the faucet when filling the water reservoir."
"Of course you're not going to get much power with 1 AA battery, but the water capacity is good enough and it's better than nothing. Seems pretty solidly constructed too. However, I wonder if one of the manual squeeze bottles wouldn't be just as effective (if not more) for a whole lot less money. It's hard to justify this device at this price."
"Works OK. Not nearly as much pressure as the plug in model on my toilet. But in combo with toilet paper, I get much cleaner."
"I've now used this for 2 months while away from my home Washlet. I'm so glad I purchased it. Sure, its not like what I have at home (I miss the air dry, especially), but it works very well. I do feel clean after using it. Now I won't be able to travel without it!"
Personal Hygiene: This little handheld bidet works great for travel or home use. I prefer our TOTO Washlet E550s Toilet Seat for home. This little portable travels well and works well away from home!
"The item being sold is the YEW350 not the US version HW300. While it is effectively the same functionality, everything is in Japanese from the instructions to the labels and molded in wording on the unit. There are other cheaper options when searching from the YEW350, so just buy that instead since that is actually what is being sold."
"Nothing will replace the bidet that attaches to one's toilet, but when not at home, this will have to do. The water jet stream is adjustable (2 settings) for strong and soft, but the strong can't compete with the home appliance's power. This is a very well-made device, though, and should last many years."
It was a hit with my wife and her girlfriends at the camping site. The children want to use it for squirt gun so be prepared for that. All is well and working as promised. We have three Toto toilets in our homes and this is the perfect on the road or off the road addition to happy number 1 and 2....
Like the size and portability the most. Haven't found anything to dislike.
"This probably is one of my best purchases in the last year! This is an amazing portable gadget that I hope will be trouble-free for years to come. It does the trick. Portable, just strong enough, and nearly pocket-size for easy carrying. For hygiene sake this is a must and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to be on the cutting edge of cleanliness!"
"My husband used this Washlet constantly on a recent cruise. While it is not as good as our bidet at home, it certainly beat not having it at all."
"I read all the reviews and it seems if you get a ""good"" one you our in luck (LUCK IN BUYING A PRODUCT FROM A WELL KNOW BRAND NAME---RIDICULOUS!!!???) it is a great product and will work as advertised. I know this cause I got to use it for 20 sec while it ""worked"". However I knew I was in trouble when the battery was not charging correctly. Then the adjustment mode did not work and finally the bat last 20 seconds at most. So I had all the problems that, and I mean all, the problems mentioned under 1 star. Why Conair does not see this or these same complaints over and over without correction and provide better service is beyond me!"
"For personal hygiene it can't be beat. This is the second one that I have owned, having bought the original one in Japan, and after years of use managing to drop it from a height onto a hard floor, breaking it. This is a really nice product that should be available in every corner drug store."
This is a great solution for those Indians who are not used to paper cleaning on commode. Europe and USA hotels don't provide any water supply near the commodes. This is a replacement of the water spouts and jets which are available near commodes in India.
"Does what it says - pocket sized (large pocket), portable washlet. Toto quality throughout. Don't expect the strong stream you get from the fixed Washlet seats, but this does the job when you're away from home. Be prepared to refill the unit if you need to use a lot of water."
This works! Nice strong stream. Don't buy the hand press bottles as the stream is not as strong and it's a chore to use specially for older persons. Use the Toto.. with just a press of a button nice strong and even stream. Just wished the price were lower.
"This is an elegant solution for just about anyone. If you travel you will soon wonder how you got along without this lovely tool. And as an older person who finds toilet paper in public places irritating to use, this washlet make life neat and painless."
"This is a great product. Not only is it well designed and well built, but it meets my needs when I travel. We love our Toto washlet toilet seat at home and really miss it when we go down south for the winter. This is a big help"
"I have a GUSTYLE IPX6 travel bidet that I had bought a couple years ago for $23. I was looking for something with more water pressure. I ordered this. For $100. It was pretty much the same effect, with the added hassle of no instructions in English and 4x the price. Returned it, obviously."
Have used in all places including planes and road side restrooms.. getting a second one
"Portable size makes it convenient to take anywhere. Leaves you clean and fresh. You are not having to use as much toilet paper, less paper going into your septic tank."
"Definitely not quite as convenient as the commode system, it serves well for travel."
The water pressure was much stronger than I expected. I'm extremely happy with this purchase!
"Though on the expensive side, perfect for the purpose intended. If you have friends traveling from Japan, you can get much cheaper there (almost 50% of price here!)

I had concerns about the tank size but find it just the right amount. Will recommend it to others."
"I am pleasantly surprised at how convenient, efficient, effective and portable this product is!! Definitely worth every penny. Highly recommend it!"
"if you have a toto washlett and are expecting this to be close to the same cleaning ability then, I have some bad news for you. I think a squirt gun would have more pressure. water tank is very small. cant be used in public restrooms with any discretion. might be good for camping if you have a water jug nearby. didn't clean my area close to my liking, very difficult to maneuver and, was messy spaying water everywhere, GROSS!"
Works. Has enough power. Battery lasts for many trips. Holds enough water. Recommend and would buy again
Need some practice to get used to it. But better than nothing.
"This is a life saver where there is no toilet roll, but water is ample. Fill in a squirt, you are done. Avoids rash using the wrong kind of toilet roll paper. This is a great buy and to have as personal hygiene."
"I thought I had already reviewed this product, so again, don't waste your money. It has a very weak spray and totally ineffective. This is the third portable that I have tried and the only one that worked is the one that connects to a sink faucet and at half the cost ( Aquaus Warm Water Handheld Bidet). You just have to have good water pressure and that's why the Aquaus works so much better."
Excellent little portable bidet. I never leave home without it. It works wonders in the company restroom. People often wonder what the sound is when I use it in the stall but I don't mind.
Better than previous ones (10 years plus ago)
Very useful product but suggest a larger reservoir
We have a Toto washlet that we miss when we travel. We now have found a wonderful solution with the portable!
"We have used it for more than a month during a trip overseas and we are very impressed with its effectiveness, ease of use and most of all with the fact that we felled very ""clean"" because we used it."
"I have Rheumatoid Arthritis, Fibromyalgia, and Askling Spondylitis. My hands are strongly impacted and impaired. With this in mind, if you are using bidets due to handicap(s) especially of the hands, don't waste your money. It is very difficult to hold, maneuver, and basically impossible to use for it's intended purposes. Very disappointed."
This is really a great product. Much better quality than most others on the market. It's a wonderful traveling bidet. The two different pressures are very helpful. I feel very clean after using.
Good to have.
Don't know how I lived without one. Really pleased with this and highly recommend it. Its clear why these are so popular in other countries. We need to get with the program in the US!
needs to be larger to hold more water. Hard at first to get hang of it but useful to some degree.
"Probably not a good choice for men; not enough water, stream too weak. Way to expensive for the application but good quality."
"Not very powerful. If it could somehow be made a little stronger, it would be great. Well put together. High price."
"This has completely changed my travel experiences - it really works just as well as a bidet, very portable and easy to use, battery-powered and battery requires changing every couple of months"
The portable travel washlet allows me to travel and leave my home. I have used one for over 15 years.
"I really like this product. I cannot afford installing the official washlet on my toilet, but this portable one does the same job, and I can take it on my trip."
"Seems to work well, but I would like more pressure than it can deliver."
Not strong enough I own a toto toilet seat this is ok.
This is the only thing better than having a proper Toto bidet washlet toilet seat - one for on the go!!! Can't live without it.
"It's OK, if a bit weak in the pressure."
"If you use a bidet at home, this is the best replacement when traveling. It provides enough pressure to clean, and holds enough water. Its just more sanitary.."
Worked fine but Not enough pressure
"Not as great as a bidet seat, but I needed something to take on vacation! It was a good substitute"
"This product has clearly been returned and repackaged, complete with scotch tape sealing the lid because the item was put back in the box incorrectly. So gross."
This is the next best thing to having a waslet.
good for travel/ work.... if you have a washlet at home.... you need this when you cant make it home :)
"nice compact design and all, but weak, too dang weak for my tenacious excrement, does a light wash only, nowhere near the plumbed pressure needed for a true thorough deep-cleaning, as it were."
"Better than nothing, but certainly not worth the money. Needs more pressure."
"First, a critical tip that I don't think is mentioned in the manual: Do NOT use the dryer until after you've flushed. It moves quite a bit of air, and you don't want that aerosolizing fecal coliform and other nasties.

The install was surprisingly easy. Working carefully, it took about 30-40 minutes and the included fittings never even threatened to leak. The instructions are unfortunately overly pictorial, a la IKEA, but they're still fairly clear. Definitely do pay attention to the various mentioned caveats in the manual, since some are unintuitive.

Using it is dead simple, though learning the remote took a day or two. TOTO helpfully includes a nice permanent labeling placard for the mount that identifies what each button on the remote does. The only thing that I don't like about using the washlet is that positioning the stream side-to-side is a bit uncomfortable/awkward (YMMV if your butt is less exceedingly bony than mine). Given that there's already a dedicated control for fore-aft positioning of the wand, I would actually prefer it if the oscillating function were side to side rather than fore-aft. The soft (better described as wide) spray mode somewhat alleviates this issue, but the pressure is obviously quite a bit lower. On the bright side, TOTO seems to have engineered their mounting bolts with sufficient elasticity that shifting side to side won't loosen them over time, unlike pretty much every other seat that I've ever seen.

As for the various other features that differentiate this from other TOTO models, I think that the tankless hot water option is absolutely mandatory. I've heard reports that the C5 can run out of hot water in 30-60 seconds, and that seems rushed relative to what feels completely clean. This also is much lower profile since it doesn't accommodate a tank, and you'll eventually come out ahead on cost with the 3036R or 3036 due to energy savings. I really don't know about the EWATER feature without seeing a scientific white paper, but I thought that it was worth an extra $100 to keep things as sanitary as possible, on the rationale that water alone doesn't keep your toilet bowl clean (this is the only difference between this seat, which is the 3036R, and the cheaper 3036).

The dryer works, albeit slowly (1-2 minutes?), and is fairly quiet. Note though that both the dryer and washlet functionalities are going to be impeded if you're sporting an excess of posterior hair. If you were someone hoping to solve the proverbial peanut-butter-in-shag-carpet problem with this single purchase, you'd probably be disappointed. The deodorizer works exceptionally well, enough so that the bathroom fan is almost always unnecessary, which probably offsets much of the additional energy used for the hot water and dryer in summer and winter months.

I've only had this for a month, so I can't speak much yet for longevity, but I expect this to last a long while. I haven't yet installed the remote's mount, and as a result the remote has already been dropped 2-3x from 2' up onto tile, without suffering a single scratch or chip that I could find, which is really impressive. TOTO does make a point of repeatedly cautioning that you shouldn't even wipe the seat with toilet paper in order to avoid scratching it; they recommend only using a wet cloth. I suspect that's overly cautious, but take their point that the extremely soft (as in Mohs hardness, not as in squishy) material in the seat is comfortable at the expense of some durability.

Overall, it's a really well built and cleverly designed product that TOTO has spent a lot of time perfecting. Do make sure that you've planned how to plug it in, but otherwise, you won't regret it. Not having to wipe feels like living in the Jetsons version of the future. That interminably annoying Charmin bear can kiss my ass."
"Bidet seats in general are fantastic. Once you try it, it's hard to contemplate going back.

I purchased this one after a bunch of research. Many online sources (e.g., Wirecutter) recommend the Toto C5 as a great bidet seat that has all the features you need at a ...sort of reasonable price. This unit has all the same features plus tankless hot water instead of a warm water reservoir. There are several advantages to this: 1) you never run out of warm water, 2) the profile of the seat gets streamlined, and 3) the K300 is more power efficient for water than the C5. The rear of this unit is about half an inch lower than the C5, but the whole seat is more sveldt. Right now the K300 is $150 or so more than the C5 and I find the price increase to be worth it for these advantages.

The rest of this review would likely apply to the C5 as well, as their features sets are the same other than tankless hot water.

Heated Seat:
Not the foremost thing people think about with bidet seats, but it's very comforting! Two thumbs up!

Ewater+ and Premist:
These are great features that help make the unit less likely to need cleaning. Ewater+ is electrolyzed water that washes the wand before and after each use. Anything that minimizes your need to clean the wand is going to be a good thing, so I appreciate this one. Premist means the seat spritzes down the bowl as soon as you sit on it. This really does prevent the bowl from getting messy. Since I've had the unit, I haven't had to work on...uh...removing evidence of use, let's say. That's something I often reluctantly had to engage in prior to installing the seat.

Wand Features:
This unit comes with the usual suspects of oscillation and pulsation, both of which I've found to be helpful. Volume, temp, and placement are easily adjustable from the remote.

Deodorization:
A fan sucks fumes from the bowl through a filter. This starts as soon as you sit down, and is more aggressive for 1 minute right after you get off the seat. Shockingly, this actually works pretty well except maybe against the toughest of stinkers. I don't find the fan noise to be offensive at night, but you can deselect this function if the noise bothers you.

Remote:
Simple and effective. All features are available on the remote and it took one or two uses to become completely familiar with it. It's intuitive. The remote has two memories, so you and your partner can easily select your preferences in a snap.

Install:
Really not too difficult. Maybe 30 minutes of work. I got no leaks on the first try. You must have a GFCI outlet within 3 feet of the toilet for the cord to reach.

All in all, I'm very happy with this purchase."
"This toilet seat is great. When you sit down to do your -ahem- ""buisiness"", an air purifier starts, water begins to coat the bowl to keep it clean, and the seat is warm. When you are finished, it cleans you with a pleasant stream of warm water, and dries you with a pleasant, clean-smelling stream of warm air. When you stand, the air is power cleaned to prevent odors from escaping into the room (or your nose), and after a short delay, the wand that sprays water cleans itself. Everything is adjustable from the position of the water jet, to the intensity. It can pulsate, oscillate, and add air bubbles to the water to make it feel softer. The temperature of the seat, the water and the air dryer can also be adjusted and customized. Settings can all be saved for two separate users, and it never runs out of warm water unlike many other products of this type, which is not a fun thing to have happen. There is a button that moves the stream forward a few inches for feminine cleansing as well. The air coming out of the bowl smells a lot like the air after a thunderstorm, rather than less pleasant smells. There is a handy remote to control it all, with a wall mounting bracket. It feels really clean and refreshing when you are done, and you will probably not go through more than one roll of toilet paper in a month as it is now only used for a final pat dry. There are definitely a lot of positives to this product.

When it arrived, it was well packaged, with three instruction books (three languages). The English instructions were not written by a native speaker, but are good nontheless. It is obviously a well made product.

Now let's go through the negatives.

Installation: Putting the bidet on your toilet is fairly straight forward. I won't go through the entire process, but there are a few things to consider. The first is that you need an electrical outlet near your toilet for the bidet to operate, something that is not very common in construction unless you specifically ask for it. If you do not have one, an electrician can usually install one for around one to two hundred dollars (your area may be slightly more or less). The outlet should have a breaker on it since it will probably be fairly near the water hose that fills the tank on your toilet. The bidet is not cheap, so make sure you factor this cost into the total cost of your project. If you are handy, you can install the outlet yourself for about fifty dollars, including parts, but rememberto get an outlet with a breaker on it.

The bidet is secured to your toilet with brass fittlings in rubber sleeves that are inserted through the screw holes built into the porcelain for the lid and then tightened. This compresses the rubber sleeve, holding the unit firmly in place. The instructions indicate that you should lubricate the rubber sleeve with water to help it slip through. In my case, on one side it would not fit. I first tried lubricant, then using a Dremel to bore out the hole a bit and next thinned the rubber sleeve, and finally put a metal rod against the threaded brass piece on the top, screwed the bolt in on the bottom to pull it down and used a mallet to pound it through. It barely did the job, but I managed to get it in without cracking the porcelain.

The rest of the installation was easy. The water line and cord are a bit long. I am sure the extra length is needed for some installs, but looks untidy on mine (see photo). I may have to cut and splice, but that is for another day.

The product itself has a few areas that I feel could use some improvement, and there are some things that you should know about.

The top lid is LONG. When it is raised the tip stands a full two feet off of the surface of the porcelain. This is something to consider if you are planning to use an over the toilet space saver shelf, as it might prevent the lid from fully opening. In my case it is not a problem as the lid is 9 1/2 inches from the wall and most of these shelves stand nine inches from the wall. With the moulding, it -just- fits. The plastic lid is also thin, and the instructions warn you not to lean back on it, I assume so that you don't break it. The whole thing can be easily removed for cleaning (with the exception of the mounting bracket that stays attached to your toilet), so perhaps if it does get broken, the lid can be replaced.

Electricity and water use: The seat is heated all of the time unless you turn it off, the water is heated on demand, and the LED lights are always on. Used as intended, the bidet will be drawing power all of the time. All of the water used by the bidet is water that would not have otherwise been used, from the pre-mist on the bowl to cleaning the wand to cleaning you. You can turn some of these functions off, though and there are two eco modes. You can also set it to turn off for either six or nine hours a day but if you live in an area where it is already warm, power is pricey, or you worry about impact to the environment you might want to turn the seat heating functions off altogether. Honestly, I think most of this is offset by the reduced toilet paper usage.

If you lose the remote, or it is damaged, there is no way to use the bidet as there are no controls on the bidet itself, and a replacement is around $200. Don't lose the remote, people! The mounting bracket has an insert that lets the remote be permanently mounted unless you use a screwdriver, in case you are worried someone will move or take it.

Finally, there is a decent amount of maintenance for this product. Toto recommends that it be unplugged daily and cleaned with a wet cloth (not toilet paper), although I doubt anyone does this. If you use toilet bowl cleaner, wash it off within three minutes to prevent funes from causingany issues. If you are going to be gone for an extended period, or there is the possibility of a freeze, you should drain the water from the unit and unplug it.

Once a month the following maintenance is recommended: There is a filter for the deodorizer (basically a plastic screen) that should be removed and cleaned with a toothbrush; the wand that sprays water should be wiped down (there is a whole procedure for this); The bidet should be removed and the gap should be cleaned; the lid should be removed and the gap there cleaned; and then every six months remove and clean the water filter. To be honest, I'm guessing not many people do many of the periodic maintenance tasks unless there is a problem or noticable dirt, but I could be wrong.

Is it perfect? No. But it is damn good, and using the washlet not only makes you feel clean, but suddenly an unpleasant task is not quite so unpleasant. The clean air smell alone is worth the price of admission in my humble opinion, especially if you have a partner that wants to use the bathroom for any purpose after you do your business, or they use the bathroom before you. If you are asking yourself if you really need a bidet, imagine getting dog poo on your hand and then just wiping it with a paper towel and then going about your day. Would it be clean? No? You need water to get things clean, and this is an area that gets dirty every day. So do you need one? I think we can agree that you get cleaner, it actually feels nice to use and smells nicer with one than without one."
"If you want a heated seat, heated cleaning water, carbon filter for odor, auto clean for wand, remote control, eco adjustments, 2 person one touch settings, and customizable settings, plus high quality, then buy this one.
I have used hundreds of bidets in Japan and this one makes a normal toilet into a regular bidet.
I highly recommend it after 6 weeks of use!
It really works well.
And it has a dryer for your bottom that works as well and a pre spray for your toilet so nothing sticks to the bowl."
"With the K300 in my life, my ass is in a much better place. It’s been nicer to me, not as moody, gives me cute gifts I never expected. Don’t ask.

Here’s my very detailed review (for TL;DR, scroll to bottom):

My only previous bidet experience was squatting on my mother’s S300. An older model but a game-changer for this reviewer’s ass. I figured the K300 could only be an improvement and I didn’t want to risk buying outside the Toto family. I think I made the right call.

The key features your butt desires are very satisfying. Some work more “noticeably” than others. The real question is value. The K300’s unit and remote are packed with essentials plus what feel like filler features to justify cost. Compare this with the less expensive C5 Washlet, which has almost the same features except, notably, continuous warm water and an additional energy saving mode.

(***For details of my experiment with Toto’s energy options, scroll down to “Ass has MIXED FEELINGS about”***)

Ass is HAPPY with…

REAR CLEANSING (front of remote): WATER PRESSURE ADJUSTMENT, WAND POSITION ADJUSTMENT (think of this as the rifle sight for precision targeting)
If these things don’t work, it’s not a bidet, it’s a bi-don’t. And, oh yes, they work! I was surprised how precise the 5 settings are for each feature.

Care for a gentle, but direct spritz? Done. Want a cannon shot to the ass? You asked for it, and you deserve it. Something in between? Have it your way.

The wand positioning is calibrated to what feels like the millimeter. That is service.

FRONT CLEANSING (front of remote)
My particular junk doesn’t really need a frontal assault, but it seems just as effective as its aft cousin.

TOILET SEAT TEMPERATURE (back of remote)
There are technically four settings, including no heat. The three warmth settings feel distinct from each other. In October, I’m good having it turned off, but in January, I’ll be using this feature a lot. Low setting is slightly warm, Medium is unmistakably warm, High is oooh quite toasty indeed.

DRYER (front of remote)/DRYING AIR TEMP (back of remote)
I’m talkin’ strong, island breezes. Low is refreshingly cool, not cold. Medium is lukewarm. High is just short of hot. Depending on my beach fantasy at the moment, any of the three could be in play.

When I push the dryer icon (front of remote), the unit switches from rear or front cleanse to drying mode instantaneously. Awesome.

PERSONAL SETTING LOCK (front of remote)
If there are two people in your home (and only two) who want to lock in their preferred wand position, water pressure and warm water temp, there are presets for that! If you have a family of 5 that use the same toilet, maybe draw straws?

DEODORIZER and PREMIST
Some reviewers are not fans of the deodorizer (an ionized carbon cartridge + a cleanable plastic filter). There are actually two automatic deodorizing moments: 1) as soon as you sit; and 2) once you’ve risen from the seat. I’m torn because I quite like the smell just after I’ve planted my butt on the Washlet. I find it emits a clean and pleasant aroma without fragrance. Weirdly, from a distance, after I’ve stepped away, sometimes the bathroom smells funky to me.

The good news is you can disable either or both deodorizing moments by following a couple steps in the manual. I don’t know how long the cartridge will hold up before a replacement is needed, but overall, I dig it.

Not sure if it’s ultimately wasteful, but the premist seems like a nifty way to limit bowl staining. This also can be disabled.

Ass is CONTENT with…

REAR CLEANSING: WARM WATER TEMPERATURE (back of remote)
Technically, there are four temperature settings if you include the choice to go with an unheated water stream.

Unlike the C5, the K300 provides continuous heated water, but on the low and medium settings, it starts to feel cooler after about 10 seconds. Maybe it’s just me. I may be/have an insensitive ass – I hear that a lot. I’m guessing that my butt is simply adjusting to the temperature.

HOWEVER, on the highest setting, the heat gets serious. If you’ve had hot salsa and you want to fight fire with fire, go to #3. It’s hot and stays hot.

(In defense of the K300’s continuous heated water, if you turn OFF the warm water completely, it’s a shocking difference from even the lowest setting. You’ll get a distinctly bracing blast of cool up your bum you won’t forget… and maybe you’ll like it).

AUTO WAND CLEANING(front of remote)/ON-DEMAND WAND CLEANING (back of remote)
Not sure what to make of auto wand cleaning. Word on the street (the manual) is that “EWater” (your toilet water) cleans the wand from which the glorious bidet stream hails from. You can’t witness this magical cleaning as it occurs because the wand is inside its… uh… cave. It’s not soaking in anything but water, so I dunno, maybe it works??

On-demand wand cleaning is a bit different. The wand pokes out from its hiding place like a turtle and stays out while you, dear user, may clean the wand with a wet cloth. (A turtle will not allow you to do that.) Press Stop to make the wand retract. Pretty cool.

REMOTE CONTROL (front and back)
As remotes go, it’s not bad. The front side icons are plain enough, though I recommend you keep the waterproof cheat sheet that comes with the packaging and can be attached to your wall beside the remote holder. The back of the remote, however, is a little busy and you’ll keep referring to the manual to know what does what. Most importantly, the K300 is very responsive to remote cues.

A nifty feature is how the back of the remote is magnetized to snap into place against its holder. Once you screw the holder to a wall, the remote can be easily removed or held in place. The packaging comes with a tiny anti-theft adapter to fasten the remote against the holder, but that makes adjusting heat and energy features (buttons on back of remote) impossible.

A common (and fair) gripe I've seen is with the remote's lack of glow-in-the-dark buttons. In the wee hours, you’re forced to either flip on a light or blindly guess by general location and feel (seriously, don’t do it). My workaround was to order some inexpensive, adhesive tap lights and stick one onto a shelf above the remote. Problem solved.

Ass has MIXED FEELINGS about…

ENERGY SAVER SETTINGS (back of remote):
Who wouldn’t want a discretionary expense like a bidet to conserve energy, right? At first I was skeptical about all of these features. But depending on what you’re looking for, one of these options may hit the spot.

TIME ENERGY SAVER lets you press a button and turn off the seat heater for 6 or 9 hours, as if your bladder and/or bowels are on one of those very fixed schedules. Why not 4 and 8 hours, or 5 and 10? Why not just turn the seat temperature button off and on as needed? This is an old humidifier gimmick most of us ignore.

AUTO ENERGY SAVER “lowers” the seat temp during times of infrequent use. According to Toto Tech Support, it can take up to 20 days to fully learn usage patterns. On my unit, it kicked in after about 5 days (indicated by the orange Energy Saver standby LED). Using this option, my seat temp dropped to around 82F/28C. That’s about 5 degrees warmer than a turned off seat (see more below), a slightly detectable difference. If you sit on the seat when the Energy Saver LED is lit up, it automatically starts heating to your desired preset heat level.

AUTO ENERGY SAVER+ (available on the K300, but not the C5) does exactly what the normal mode does during times of less frequent use, but it also learns to completely “turn off” seat heat when you never use it. For most of us who aren’t vampires, that means heat settings will drop to low 80s at various times during the day, and will shut off somewhere within the hours of 12am and 6am.

Guess what saves the most energy… simply pressing the remote’s power button! Or get the same result by turning off the seat temperature button. Once you reactivate the K300/seat, the seat immediately starts heating up to your latest heat setting.

Using an infrared thermometer, I tested how long it takes for the seat to hit each setting’s final resting temp from a turned off, cool state: 77-78F/25C. This is about the same as my room temp and three degrees warmer than my toilet’s porcelain base that the unit sits on. Your temps may vary.

My results (significantly warmer than the 82-97F low-high range listed by Toto):
LOW SETTING: It takes 2 minutes from 77-78F/25C to reach a temp of ~90F/32C*
MEDIUM SETTING: It takes 3 minutes from 77-78F/25C to reach a temp of ~100F/38C*
HIGH SETTING: It takes 4 ½ minutes from 77-78F/25C to reach a temp of ~110F/43C*
ALL SETTINGS: It takes 45 seconds for the seat to feel warmer after powering on the unit when preset to any level. This is also the “feel warmer” time after activating the seat by sitting on it while auto energy saver is in standby.

*During the heating process, temperatures will actually spike even higher (up to 116F on High) before cooling back down to the temps listed above as final resting temperatures, which takes about 15 minutes.

Imo, time energy saver is a gimmick, but the auto energy saver modes have value. If you’re concerned about energy savings, your best bet is to simply power off the unit or turn off the seat heat. Once you turn it back on, it takes under a minute for the seat to start to feel warm. If you can’t wait that long or your bathroom tends to be very cold, auto energy saver will keep the seat no lower than 81-82F/27C whenever you plop down on it.

Ass is SAD about…

REAR “SOFT” CLEANSING (front of remote)
“Cleanses your rear with soft embracing water flow.” Compared to regular power, meh. Imagine the feeble spritz from grandmother’s squeaky vintage perfume atomizer. Under-whelming.

OSCILLATING CLEANSING and PULSATING CLEANSING (front of remote)
Gimmicks, I say! Oscillating feels, to me, like barely detectable staccato jets being sprayed at the same target. It audibly sounds like it does it more than it feels like anything special. Pulsating is a joke. It does nothing discernible from regular rear cleanse, according to the expert on such things, my ass.

CONFIRMATION OF SETTING (back of remote)
This button only reminds you which energy setting you’ve previously chosen by alighting it on the remote. To check your heat settings (seat, water, dryer), you’ll need to press each of those buttons once to see the current setting. To check wand settings on the front of the remote, you’ll need to check those separately. If the confirm button confirmed ALL remote settings at once, then it would be cool.

TL;DR:
As of October 2022, the K300 currently runs about $150 more than Toto’s C5 Washlet on Amazon. The key difference is that the K300 offers continuous warm water and the C5 does not. On the lower settings, the K300’s warmth feels (to my ass) like it dissipates after 10 seconds, but it certainly feels warmer than an unheated water stream.

Beyond that, the K300 (but not the C5) offers something called Auto energy saver+, which learns when to lower your seat temp and when to shut off heat entirely, based on usage patterns. If you really care about energy, just hit the power button (or deactivate seat heat) when you’re not using it. Once you power it on again, it takes just 45 seconds to feel the seat get warm and 2-5 minutes (depending on the setting) to reach its target temperature.

Despite some gimmicky or unnecessary features, the K300 is a gift to all asses. If your ass requires a continuous warm water stream, then it’s worth passing over the C5 and paying extra for the K300.

**INSTALLATION TIPS**

SHIFTING TOILET SEAT AFTER INSTALL
As others have suggested, make sure you have the mounting plate bolts firmly screwed into the black rubber sleeves which pass down through the toilet’s rear bolt holes. Under the toilet, you should be able to see the rubber ""bunched up"" with the bolt sticking out about an inch. Please know, even when the mounting plate is firmly screwed in with the Washlet unit snapped in place, the seat can still be nudged about 1/8”-1/4” from center as it sits on top of the basin. You’ll find this with most toilet seats. It’s not broken, it just has a tiny amount of give.

BLACK RUBBER SLEEVES WON’T FIT INSIDE BOLT HOLES
Another problem you may face is that the rubber sleeves will not pass DOWN through your toilet’s bolt holes. Some toilets make it tricky, but that doesn't mean you need to return the washlet.

First, try nudging the sleeves UP from underneath the toilet. Screw a bolt into the bottom of the sleeve a few turns, then press a screwdriver into the bolt head and push upward until the upper disc of the black rubber sleeve pokes through the top of the bolt hole. Pull the disc up with your fingers until it’s flat against the base. If that works, you’re in business.

SEATING THE WASHLET SEAT WHERE YOU WANT IT
The mounting plate’s two metal brackets allow you to “seat” the Washlet unit more forward or farther back depending on which grooves you place them into. I recommend setting your unit as far back as you can without causing the back of the unit to rub up against the toilet tank. I found that when the unit is too far forward – even fractionally – the Washlet’s toilet seat offered less surface area under my backside. It was just kind of annoying, like a tiny pebble stuck in my shoe, or beneath my ass."
"Looks great and high in quality / value. After 5yrs using our first washer seat, a Brondell Swash 1000, and being very pleased with it, the seat cracked exactly in the back middle with a growing, pinching (ouch) gap. We're both well less than 200 pounders, LOL, and it was installed in our personal, main suite bathroom, our kids are grown and so just us 2 adults that used it. We even kept the seat settings always at lowest heat setting and in Eco Save mode, so it cannot be from degradation from long term high heat exposure, either. After 5 years, we almost rebought the 1000 and even looked at the 1400 Brondell model, but the pics and reviews online showed these models have this seat crack as a known latent defect and reportedly Brondell acting difficult about handling it as such (an epidemic defect that's out of warranty). Also, water leaks reportedly, commonly emerging as units age (although fixable with the YouTube videos out there) was concerning. I'd like to point out the basic functionality here was a ""seat"" first and foremost, and frankly the expensive Brondell built basic seat functionality failed miserably! Disappointed, we started shopping around ...

We previously bought a Toto Neorest washer as a part of a full replacement potty unit ($$$) when doing our second bath's remodel last year because it looked so cool (looks like a big egg). It was expensive, but we were determined to have style and a washer type unit after being sold on the concept by our first Brondell Swash 1000 add-on seat experience. We love the Toto Neorest. So now that we were forced to re-shop for our main bathroom this time, Brondell was a natural, cost effect and darn good add-on solution again to just fix it or possibly replace the seat. BUT, after 5 yrs it was aging and looked it. When replacing and with a few more dollars, the competitive Toto K300, along with our added prior Toto experience, and the online reports of Brondell quality and service issues, we decided to make the leap to go Toto washers for both bathrooms.

After the easy replacement install (wall electrical outlet already existing from the Brondell unit) and seeing the difference in quality (design and materials) side by side (Brondell Swash1000 and Toto K300), we also experienced what we first thought would be a less effective, more soft-cleaning (comfort) performance than what the Swash 1000 produced (or even the Toto Neorest). After using several times, we wrongly doubted its performance and now very glad we made the Toto choice again with the K300.

Somehow, the Toto K300 manages to clean better and seemingly more easily (less harsh spray) than the Brondell Swash 1000 (would typically use full force to get spotlessly clean) or even its Toto big brother, big buck, Neorest (it is less harsh in capability than the Brondell, and more like the K300 in experience, but Neorest also is somehow not as a complete in clean experience - and we always paper check!). Surprisingly, this K300 best overall performance comes along and beats a similar, cost competitive, easy install, add-on unit like the Brondell Swash as well as the fully optioned Toto Neorest total potty unit we first bought ($$$)!

Note Brondell's Swash 1000 and Swash 1400 models are built on the same design platform and use the same parts, including the latent defect seat, which is why I threw the 1400 into this review.

Bottom line, spend the few dollars more and buy the Toto K300 for its looks, quality and performance. Toto K300 looks sleeker, lower, leaner and more modern than the Brondell Swash 1000 and 1400 and goes about performing ""the job"" better. Although not U.S.A. built, the Toto is marked as made in Malysia, and not China. As initially expected with the Brondell, subsequently sent to the trash bin, we certainly do not expect our Toto seat(s) to crack no matter how old they get and will update if that ever happened."
"I’ve owned for a few days and I will update if I run into negative experiences, (so no news is good news) but this thing is everything I wanted.

Functions:
Seat warming (adjustable)
Odor control (works! We have no venting in our new house as it’s 123 years old. Until we get the venting installed, this was/is key! It’s amazing!)
Spray with movement, pulsing and a “front” that I was for extra back reach. I’m not sure how well it’s work for actual fronts, but bodies vary.
ENDLESS hot water!!! I had a previous bidet that didn’t have this feature and I LOVED constantly punching buttons to finish the job.
Cleans the bowl before and after, auto cleans spigot, extra deodorizing.
Nice effective breeze to dry the bottom
Quick release button for easy monthly cleaning. YES!!! Works and I love it. Also a solid connection.

Effectiveness:

Deodorizing gets a “thank god” check mark. Works.

Sprays get a check here too. I thought I’d be upset that there weren’t a variety of spray styles. The Toto spray works, and the bidet I had that had a variety would get clogged up and Spray differently each time and ultimately became less effective. The single spray style seems to be the better play. I do my last toilet paper dab and that is usually not even required. My other bidet experience required extra clean up duty and sometimes another wash.

Drying, this thing blows much better than my old bidet which could leave me dripping a little and I ultimately just stopped using. So, this was also a big upgrade.

Sturdiness:

The seat is connected with two bolts and a rubber connection that gets sucked up and friction holds everything in place. I’m a big guy and I got it tight enough that there is ZERO movement. The quick lock mechanism is then inserted and it’s great.

Looks:

I don’t like that the water cords angle prevents it from going straight back in the left side. A slight tweak and this would have been a much cleaner look.

The low profile (for a bidet) is nice, thanks to the tankless water heating. I like the look.

Pricing: currently Amazon has better pricing than the box stores which have this model at 700. I had only planned on spending 500, which the c5 tanked version could have accomplished, but I have zero regrets splurging an extra hundred. This hit all my feature check marks without unwanted extras.

Overall, I can’t recommend this bidet enough. The perfect level of features and incredible effectiveness makes this a solid win for me even if the hose will bug me slightly the trade off is worth it."
"I recently purchased this TOTO Washlet, and I must say, it's been a game-changer in my bathroom experience. The standout feature for me is the instant warm water functionality, which has significantly elevated my comfort level during use.

The washlet's form factor is sleek and perfectly fits my elongated toilet, adding a touch of modern elegance to my bathroom. The installation process was straightforward, and I appreciated how seamlessly it blended with my existing setup.

The instant warm water feature is truly remarkable. With the ability to adjust the heat settings, I can customize the water temperature to my preference and feel the temperature change almost instantly. The best part? The warm water supply seems limitless, as it didn't run out even during extended use, offering a consistently comfortable and refreshing experience.

However, I did find one minor drawback: the remote control. While it functions adequately, I found it less intuitive to use. It took a bit of getting used to, but once I got the hang of it, operating the washlet became more straightforward.

Now, let's talk about the drying feature. This is where the washlet falls short in my opinion. The drying fan design, with a square and two L-shaped vent openings, could be improved. While it does the job to some extent, I found it didn't provide the level of efficiency I was hoping for. I wish TOTO would re-design the entire drying experience to ensure a more effective and thorough drying process.

Overall, this model with never ending warm water feature has brought a new level of comfort and convenience to my daily routine. Its sleek design and seamless integration make it an excellent addition to any bathroom. The instant warm water feature is a true highlight, offering a never-ending supply of warmth for a pleasant experience. Though the remote control and drying fan could use some refinement, I am thrilled with my purchase and would recommend it to anyone seeking an upgrade to their bathroom experience."
"New user here. Got this because of upcoming shoulder surgery.

These toilet seat bidets take up some room behind you, so they cut off some of the opening behind. I knew this going in so opted to replace my round toilet with an elongated one for this bidet, and I'm glad I did. You lose 1-2"" in the back. This setup is perfectly comfortable and allows plenty of ooching around on the seat during the wash and plenty of room for my junk up front without creating a ""leak"" when the wand is spraying.

There is a bidet learning curve for those of you who haven't yet done it. The middle wand position is right for me and I use medium power. I don't care for the slow seat closing as I always want it all the way down before flushing to avoid the typical cloud of bacteria/germs that pop out. Not a big deal as I can push it down quickly, but it's a feature I don't want. Another feature I don't want is the heated seat. Unfortunately, I have not found a way to turn it off unless I turn the bidet off with the remote, which I do. The energy saving system is bizarre and complicated and the manual does not help. Near as I can tell, there is no way to get it to turn off the heated seats all the time.

The remote is easy to use and understand.

Other than those two minor irritants, it's a good unit. Time will tell if it lasts...

The butt dryer works well. One minute of it and everything down there is dry."
"Of everything I own and have bought in my life, nothing has had more of a positive impact and makes me happier in life than this.

If my house was burning down and I could only rescue one item, it would be this bidet.

What's my favorite part? All of it: the heated seat, the heated water, the warm blow dryer on this model is the best I've ever used, and that includes the high end bidets i've used in Japan, Hawaii, and Bora Bora.

Every toilet should be required to have this on it. The one consideration is that it must have a nearby outlet to plug into. My advice would be to blast a hole in your wall and set up an outlet if you don't have one.

If there is any item on all of Amazon that could change your life for the better, this is it."
"Our 2nd TOTO Bidet seat. 1st one was for smaller toilet - no problems. 2nd was for new elongated toilet - SW3036R Washlet K300. After one weeks use, the dryer function stopped working. I could hear it activate but no fan motor initiation. Called customer service. Juan helped troubleshoot it over the phone. Very helpful and finished with sending a replacement including shipping tags etc. for the return of the old one. I guess I expect the worse from any interaction with any customer service department. This was a very pleasant surprise. The replacement came FedEx ground, I installed it using only the new parts needed, packaged back up in the box it came in, and took it to local Walgreens for shipment. All is well in respect to the new one functioning and setup. Would have given the Bidet seat 5 stars if there had not been the original problem but would give the customer service I experienced 5 stars if there was a line item to do so."
"A surgery was my excuse to try my very first bidet. Between research and word-of-mouth, I decided that Toto was the brand with the features and reliability I'd like. Unfortunately I found that most of the info I found online comparing the C5, K300, and S500-series misses key points. I ended up buying all 3 and hopefully my first-hand comparison of all 3 would help.

First off, I feel continuous hot water (tankless heater) is a must-have, and I ended up returning the C5. The C5's tank of hot water lasts for maybe 20-30 seconds at a constant temperature, and then the water slowly cools. If you're efficient, you can get the job done in that time, just like how you can take a 1 minute shower if you know the water's gonna go cold soon thereafter. In practice, I found it psychologically uncomfortable to feel like I'm racing against the clock to get myself clean. Plus, especially as a ""newbie"" bidet user, it tends to take longer to gently build up the water pressure and adjust the settings to achieve a confident clean. It sucks to feel like you're gonna run out of hot water before you're clean.

The great news about the K300 and S550 is that both models have unlimited, constant temp hot water. I honestly found both to be super satisfactory. But, I will say, most comparisons downplay the difference between them.

On paper, the S550 adds an auto-open lid and a ""front wide"" wash, plus a more intuitive remote. But in practice, everything about the S550 is enhanced:

- The S550's default spray gets to a stronger level
- The S550's ""soft"" rear spray is wider than the K300's. It tends to clean faster while not feeling uncomfortable for sensitive people. But unfortunately it also splashes a bunch more water all over your rear side, making the drying time worse.
- The S550's dryer has a better pattern. The K300 feels like a jet of concentrated air that you have to shift around your rear to get even coverage. The S550's dryer feels more uniform and you can feel swirling air currents. Plus the 4/5 heat setting for me strikes that perfect balance of fast drying while not feeling like it's burning my rear, while the K300's 2/3 setting feels too cool while the 3/3 feels too hot.
- The ""bowl misting"" sprayer on the S550 sprays much more thoroughly and evenly compared to the K300, which sometimes incompletely coats the bowl and allows dirt to still cling especially near the front.
- Speaking of misting: The use of e-water is actually different between the models. On the K300, e-water is ONLY used to clean the wand. The bowl mister is only plain water. On the S550, plain water is used to pre-mist the bowl ""before you go"", but after you flush, it will spray down the bowl AND the wand with e-water. In practice I see a ton less of the ""red ring"" of bacteria/algae buildup in the toilet bowl that has the S550 on it.

To be honest, the K300 is a great value because it really does deliver 90% of the features that matter at maybe 60% of the price of the S550, and anything below the K300 feels like a huge downgrade due to the lack of unlimited hot water. But it's totally false to just say the S550 adds an auto-opening lid and night light. Everything else that the S550 does is slightly but noticeably better too. So if you're the kind of person who can stomach the price and would rather get the best, the S550 might be right for you."
"This purchase was recommended.

After reading some of the reviews there was a degree of concern for the installation. It took longer to get the tools out and put them back than to do the installation. The instructions weren't as easy for me to understand as just using common sense and doing the job.

The remote instructions are also confusing but using some good sense and experimenting, this too is coming along OK.

The purpose of the device and the effectiveness is yet to be determined. So far so good.

We'll update this after a few months of use. so far... :-)"
"We had 2 Toto C200 models that were over 7 years old and finally stopped working. I guess that is a normal ""lifetime"" for washlets? There is no real way to ""fix"" them that I could find and figured it was just as well to replace with newer model.

I put in a price watch on camel and waited for these to come down in price ($500) before jumping on two K300s as a replacement. Between this and the C5 I felt the tankless feature of the K300 was worth the $100 difference. The s550e (discontinued and being replaced) is nearly double the price for a nicer remote, minor upgrades and auto lid features that I couldn't justify.

The K300 works just as well as the C200 model but has a lower profile and feels a bit more comfortable to sit on. I liked some aspects of the older C200 remote better (bigger and LCD screen on back for settings) but also like some aspects of the newer remote (having certain functions on front instead of side buttons). The tankless water heater is nice but does start with 1 second of lukewarm water. It doesn't bother me.

If I can get another 7 years out of these I'll be happy and stick with the Toto brand."
"This is our second Toto washlet with improved controls. It took a while to convince my husband that a washlet is a must have for the home but after we installed one and I mentioned purchasing a second one for our master bath, he was on board. There are multiple spray and pressure options for cleaning one's derriere or devant. Plus you can customize settings for multiple users. The heated seat is wonderful when you wake up in the middle of night to a cold bathroom. I love that the seat has a slow closure but it spoils you and when you visit a friend, it's easy to forget theirs don't. This model has more features than our first such as the dryer which I don't find that useful plus it has an odd moldy smell which some users describe as an old band aid odor. The other reason I didn't give it 5 stars is both have a very large sticker on the inside of the lid. It's a warning not to spray cleaner directly on the washlet. Why can't the user remove this or have it easy to reapply for your cleaning service? Finally, You don't need a plumber to install this; it is easy for anyone not mechanically inclined. I would choose the Toto brand again. It is top of the line and we have not had one problem with any of the washlets. Once you have a washlet, you will ask yourself why it took so long to add it to your bathroom."
I've had my washlet for 4 months now. My toilet paper consumption is way down and I've never felt so clean. I love the wall remote and the hot water on demand feature of this model. I've never run out of hot water. The dryer does a decent job in the back but not so much in the front. That's my only complaint and it is minor. I'm planning to get another one for my second bathroom. I highly recommend this product.
"Bought one for our primary and guest bathrooms…paid for chair height elongated toilets and for an electrician to install outlets.

The heated seats are money. Makes the entire experience extremely enjoyable. We are in love. So happy!!!"
Ordered this for my elderly aunt who can't clean herself properly. She loves the heated seat and the fact that I no longer have to wipe for her.
"I was accustomed a Toto 350e for many years and had to replace. This model water stream isn’t as strong but it’s much more affordable and does the job. Has all the basics I was after including heated seat, constant warm water and adjustable wand position. I do miss the pre-mist and post mist because the new model only does one and doesn’t leave the bowl as clean as the 350e"
"I'm an old woman and installed this myself. I did have to call in some muscle to tighten the water entry hose hookups. I had to replace the 12"" entry hose with a 9"" one to accommodate the added plastic washlet water inlet addition. My ""reach"" has diminished with age and this washlet is helping to keep me clean.

One thing I would change is to allow the wand in the ""women's cleaning"" mode to move further forward to better clean after urination."
Such a wonderful investment!! Everyone should get one. Super easy to setup and use. Love it
This deserves all the hype - I am just sorry I waited so long to get one. I can't address ease of installation as I had a plumber do it. We also had to have electrical wiring. But - it was all worth it. The remote and features were surprisingly easy to figure out. I highly recommend!
"If you are a bidet user or want to become one, these seats are great! We had to have an electric outlet installed for each one we bought, but the seats are worth that hassle."
"We have loved our Toto product over the years and looked forward to this upgrade.

Alas, we are going back to one of the their other products. The seat works fine, has good features, and is relatively straightforward to install. I don't think the air jet is really strong enough to dry anything that's very wet, but it's a nice feature. It offers a lot of customization, and the warmth settings really do produce warm air, water, and seat. Toto thinks of everything...

...but the remote! It would be hard to make this many design errors without actually trying.

To begin with , it has controls on both the front and the back. Also, the documentation in the instruction manual is divided in two completely different sections, so you have to keep flipping back and forth between page 19 and 36 to get all the information on settings.

To enter the features setup, you have to start with pressing the Stop button (really). You not only have to press it, but you have to press it for a full 10 seconds each time. Sitting there and holding it for 10 seconds every time you want to try a feature or change a setting gets very old quickly.

Even worse, if you pause for longer than 60 seconds while you're looking at the manual or trying to set a feature (or you're just interrupted), the remote exits settings mode and you have to press Stop again for 10 seconds and start over.

Some features have their own button, other controls you have to simultaneously press another button, some controls have an icon for one thing (like the seat) but also control something else( like the air). This goes contrary to proper interface design principles: things should have their own button and not do anything else, and either they should all require a second button or none of them, and the icon should never not match the function it controls.

But I digress... While using the remote, you have to press one button to start something (like the wash, or the air) and then another button to stop it, so everything is a two-button exercise. This is not a problem on many models like the C2 or the older C100, because they have large buttons with well defined borders you can't miss, even by feel. But the remote buttons are quite small - maybe 1/4"" around -- and barely stick up. In fact, they're not actually buttons just raised areas on the control.

So it's easy to miss them -- you have to look at what you're doing each time. Moreover, unlike yours, our bathroom is quite dark at night (strangely enough, we like to sleep with the lights off ) and since the remote does not light up, I have to turn on my cell to turn on the wash and then turn on the air... and then find Stop to turn everything off.

In addition, when you set things (like water pressure) to your desired setting, the remote resets to media after each use. So if you want extra strong or extra soft, you must do every single time you use the seat.. This can get old very quickly. You can probably get around it by setting up a personal profile (it allows you to do this), but that's another set of instructions to master and I've not gone there since we're returning it.

After working with the manual over 3 days, I still could never get all the features working the way I wanted. The features directions take up a giant flow chart that runs across two pages. Note to manual designers: if it takes a 2-page flow chart to setup your remote it's probably too complicated. .

My advice: go with another model. Toto makes good products, but this one is ruined by a terrible user interface and poor instruction manual."
"Looks good and refined operation.
The remote is not as intuitive as some other I have used, but good enough."
"For thos who enjoy the ""library"" function of the bathroom, this device with the cushy heated seat, the warm spray and the blow dry feature make sitting down to peruse Reddit that much more enjoyable. It is a little unnerving to find my toilet seat studying my habits and going in to find that it has anticipated me and has pre-heated the seat (colored led indicators come on). Still for a luxurious ""sit down"" you can't beat this baby."
"The advantage of this is the on-demand water heater which gives you unlimited hot water. This is true, but it has the disadvantage that you get a momentary (~1 second) spray of cold or lukewarm water before it gets hot. I didn't have that issue with the C100 which had a tank and was always hot. Otherwise the features are 99% the same, the controls are just moved to a remote instead of the side. It's a good bidet but I don't think it's worth almost double the price of the entry models."
"I really like this device! We've had a non-electric cold water bidet attachment for years, but I wanted something that did a gentle front wash as well. I tried a different brand of bidet seat, but it was too forceful for the ""front"" wash yet too wimpy for the ""rear"" wash. The Toto is not as powerful as the non-electric one for the rear, but that's not necessarily a bad thing; no chance of blasting too hard, but if I angle correctly can get a bit of gentle ""enema"" action. And the front wash is liveable (almost as gentle as I'd ideally want it). There's some latitude in adjusting the position of front and rear washes (I could use more, ideally, but again I can live with it).

I've ended up setting the personalized settings for 1 as ""number one"" (i.e. peeing) and 2 as ""number two"" (i.e. pooping). That way I don't need to adjust the spray forward/backwards depending on what I'm rinsing.

I also only hear the water for the #1 setting. Trying to save energy; maybe as I age (or in a cold winter), someday I'll want a heated seat and warm water for everything, but for now it's nice to be able to choose to turn off all the non-essential extras.

After having it in use for around a month, I just took the seat off for cleaning and found it was quite clean underneath - what a nice surprise! The old non-electric attachment always collected discolored yuck around the edge of it pretty quickly, and there was none of that around or under the Toto.

I have no idea of the longevity, but so far it's been a great addition to our bathroom."
If your looking for one of these this is the one to get does what it says and more been using it about a week wish I would have got sonner I love it easy install and works fine reduce toilet paper by about 90 to 95% hope it last awhile or long time on the expensive side but you know the saying Toto is a good brand been in the business a long time
"Installation is surprisingly very easy and streamlined very well. The seat heating and water temperature is excellent. Two areas I believe need improvement; the screws provided to tighten the washlet to the toilet, don’t tighten very well causing the washlet to slide sideways. The water pressure is rather weak despite the fact that water pressure in the bathroom is very good."
"I have a Drake II Toto toilet with the bidet cutout and have been using it with an old S300e washlet. Recently the seat detection switch failed and we figured I'd replace it with a newer model as the plastic has started to yellow and the seat can be best described as off white now. The K300 seemed the most similar in features without being overly expensive but it seems to be a large step backwards where it counts the most: pressure.

On first use the pressure was so low I'd call it unusable as a bidet. Good enough for wetting toilet paper but not cleaning anything. I eventually traced this down to the dedicated bidet cutout Toto placed in the toilet. If you route the water line through the hole, like it was designed for, it kinks the hose and there's no orientation you can move it to that won't kink it. After running the hose the long way along the side of the toilet the pressure increased to tolerable but is still nowhere near what the 10 year old washlet could do. I'd say it's about 80% of the s300e. I was also able to test a s500e recently and the pressure is the same as the older s300e. Skip the K300 and C5 series if you can.

Since Toto still has a quite frankly insulting one year warranty period I'd recommend you take a look at an alternative bidet manufacturer.

Positives: I like the fact that the deodorizer now only kicks up to high speed once you get off the toilet, running at low speed while you're there. The seat on low is as hot as the older s300e was on high. The lid covers more of the edge of the bowl and should reduce splashback when flushing, as long as it's closed.

Negatives: Lower pressure. The 'pulse' function is laughably weak. The K300 series loses most of the misting functions except for once right when you sit down. The bowl light has been deleted. The first 'wand cleaning' button on the remote seems to dump water out of the wand area but doesn't extend the wand, I have no idea what that's supposed to accomplish."
"Got my bathroom remodeled, and decided to have an outlet installed so I could finally invest in a nice bidet. I looked around a lot, read a lot of reviews online about brands and specific models, and ended up deciding it was worth the extra money for the Toto Washlet... And I'm so happy I did! I've used the stereotypical Tushy-style bidet before, that just uses cold, unheated water, during winter... and it was TERRIBLE. This Toto Washlet has a tankless water heater installed, so you get warm water instantly, and you get unlimited warm water. It makes you feel so clean, and it's real nice sitting on the heated seat. I highly recommend this!"
"First, I want to say that for me 4 stars is a very good rating. This model K300 is our second Toto Washlet. Without going into details, we believe there are a lot of hygienic and others benefits to these devices. We consider them as essential.

The first unit was a model S300, which we bought in 2006. It lasted 16 years in a 2-person household and only required service once in 2015. The S300 started to leak, so we thought it was time for a new unit. The selling price of both of them was comparable (~$600), but given the amount of inflation in 16 years, this K300 is a much, much better buy. The S300 was made in Japan. I note that the K300 is now made in Malaysia, which is not necessarily a negative, but it probably accounts for part of the decrease in real price.

The installation of the K300 compared to the S300 is a bit easier. The bracket used to secure the Washlet to the toilet is a better design. And the plastic water inlet adapter is much better and simpler than the S300, which was metal and had a somewhat awkward quick connection hose fitting. The S300 had a built in filter in the inlet adapter in additional to the removable filter on the side of the Washlet itself, which both the K300 and S300 have.

The remote controls for both unit are quite different, but fairly comparable in function. The K300 remote looks like a TV remote and rests on a separate hanger that you mount on the wall. The K300 remote is designed to stay in place on the hanger with a magnetic catch, but frankly, but itself, the magnetic catch is not very secure. It would be very easy to knock it off the hanger onto the floor and possible damage the remote. However, Toto includes an ""anti-theft"" kit to prevent someone form walking away with the remote. I think this is fairly pointless from a theft standpoint, but if you install the upper bracket for the kit as shown in the picture, the remote is very secure. The anti-theft kit is designed for screwing semi-permanently to the hanger bottom of the hanger, but I would not recommend this as there are buttons on the rear of the remote for various settings.

The K300 has some newer features compared to the S300 (like e-water and pre-misting). These are nice, but not dramatic improvements. The one thing about features is they can be failure points as well, so only time will tell."
"This is our 4th Toto washlet. We, sadly, left our first 2 in the home we sold. (wish we hadn't). We've gotten the most basic, the top of the line, and the mid-level. Just to let the newbies know, the fan will not really get you dry. Knowing this, I opted for the economy model on my previous purchase without a fan, and ended up sorry. While it doesn't get you totally dry, it does cut down by at least half the amount of toilet paper used. We loved the night light, but figured we could live without it to save a few bucks.

Everyone who visits is enamored with our washlets, even those neophytes that are initially a little timid about using them. Nothing to fear.....take my word for it. And Toto will ""service"" your washlet for you and send it back fresh as a daily if you ship it to them for maintenance.

My one complaint is that such a quality and rather high priced item should not be entrusted to the post office. We received messages that our washlet was not delivered because 1. we weren't home (not true), 2. our mailbox was too full (not something you can even fit in a mailbox, and 3. another attempt would be made the following day.

We finally went in person to the post office (as they do not answer their phones) and found out that items of this size are NEVER delivered by the mail carrier and must be picked up directly from the post office. I was told that mail trucks just cannot accommodate all the Amazon deliveries they are entrusted with these days, so they just keep them at the PO location.

Another note. If you have a Kohler one piece toilet (as we do) the bolts may not fit. We had to do quite a bit of McGyvering to mount it. Make sure your bolt holes are 2"" from the back of the tank. (Ours are 1/5). So while we got it installed, it's a ""just barely"" and we will have to be careful taking a seat."
"I looked at these for 2 years, finally found the best product and price. Love this thing!"
"There's little to dislike about this unit. It works as billed and cleans you butt fairly thoroughly. You'll still need a few sheets to dry it unless you want to sit for a while. If you don't have an electrical outlet nearby, it will cost you some money to get one; else a long extension cord (and trip hazard). Wiremold installs from an existing outlet will likely cost you as much as the Toto. But ... it's worth it. Not sure how long it will last but it works great for now. Also, don't need to turn on the bathroom fan. Does a great job of eliminating odors on its own. Highly recommended. You do need to move around on the toilet seat to get a full cleaning but you'll learn how to do this after a few uses."
"I like the feature set but beware the asterisk in the manual that basically says this device will do an internal nozzle (noisy) water cleaning any time someone sits on the seat. This “feature” cannot be stopped or deactivated.

I don’t understand why this is necessary. The bidet should be smart enough to know when the bidet is used and trigger this noisy cleaning at some point after the use of the toilet. As it is, if you get up in the middle of the night to pee and sit on the seat, the bidet essentially pees before you do and it is louder and often longer. It is loud enough to be heard in a bedroom close by.

You can turn off all other cleanings and do them manually but this internal cleaning any time someone sits on the seat for any reason (regardless of whether the bidet was even used the last time someone sat on the seat) cannot be turned off.

I called Toto and all their plug-in bidets behave like this. When I said it seemed inefficient to blindly trigger a noisy nozzle cleaning regardless of whether the bidet was even used during the last time someone sat on the seat, they only defended the “feature”. Toto shouldn’t equate sitting on the seat to using the bidet. All women need to sit to pee and some guys do it by choice. The nozzle doesn’t need cleaning for that.

I like everything else about this bidet but this is kinda a deal breaker and it’s being relegated to another bathroom soon so I don’t have to listen to it make noise cleaning it’s nozzle internally for no reason when all someone is doing is sitting to pee."
"Yes I said life changing. Like winning the lottery but for your butt. Akin to getting your dream job but it's for your butt. I suppose it's just life changing for your butt. Alas, unless you are some kind of butt-less alien this is something that can change your butt's (and by extension) your life. I'm certain a lot of these life changing comments that you read on the internet come off as dramatic and sensationalized, especially to my fellow toilet paper loving American brother's and sisters out there but be rest assured, every praise that someone is willing to sing about bidets is coming from the soul.

So let me explain. If you want to greatly increase your hygiene and body health, then this is a product for you. Nothing has ever improved a daily function quite like a bidet has for me. No longer do I have to run paper across my chocolate starfish multiple times hoping that eventually I remove all the remnants of last nights spicy wings from the dark forest below. NO. Perfectly heated and directed water gently (or aggressive should you desire) removes all of the waste without any hint of aggressive rubbing. The built in automatic deodorizer dutifully fulfills it's role of removing all bad smells that might stand to ruin the bathroom experience for the next soul that has to enter your dungeon of horrors. Once you are clean, the built in blow dryer gently dries your rear to crisp clean protection. Upon finishing your battle with the throne, the automatic deodorizer kicks into high gear and the bidet goes through a self cleaning process like a toilet out of cyberpunk.

Look, TOTO makes some of the best toilet equipment on the market. If you are looking for the Cadillac of bidets then this line from TOTO is it. I can't recommend this enough as a previous non-believer. The only thing that I can say about this bidet is I would recommend that you have a dedicated electrical circuit as it can put quite a draw on an existing circuit causing some light flickering."
This bidet is amazing. Easy to install.
"Even on a good poop day, wiping with paper no longer feels clean to me. I mean, if you got poop on your hands, would you wipe them with paper and call it enough? Ewww.

Are you taking meds or supplements that make your poop problematic? Do you have IBS or another condition? Some days, are fine, and this works great. Some days, it's really soft, and this thing is a lifesaver. When it's soft (Like a Dairy Queen ice cream cone kinda soft), it's just a horrible mess as it smears everywhere. It takes half a roll of TP to even come close to cleaning up. If you have the runs (and who hasn't), I'm sure that the term ""Ring of fire"" is familiar. It's what your anus feels like after the 10th time you have to go.

This bidet makes both of those situations go away! Firm, soft, or explosive decompression. The NEVER-ENDING warm water gently blasts it away, like a little guy down there with a pressure washer! Then the warm air dries you.

Installation was a breeze, although I ran a new line to a GFI right behind the toilet while it was in transit.

If you have a dog, and want it available as an emergency backup water supply, the lid is removable. The lid was the only thing I didn't like about the design, it looks ungainly. This enabled me to save $$$ By not getting the one that automatically opens and closes! Nice feature, but I don't need it. This unit does everything BUT auto-open/close.

I've had this for three months now, and I'm looking forward to outfitting my upstairs bathroom with this as well!"
"I love this product! Something people need to know when using a bidet for the first time is that it is not perfectly aimed every time you sit. You have to get your setting programmed and wiggle around while it’s spraying. The goal is to get totally cleaned and not use toilet paper.
The blow dryer is nice but not necessary if you keep a stack of washcloths and a little bin to hang them from. Typically you dry with the cloth, hang it on the side of a tiny pail and reuse unless you go number 2. Lol"
Had been wanting a bidet seat ever since I had the TOTO bidet experience while on vacation. Came home and bought this one for my guest bath and an upgraded version for my primary bath. It was easy to install and the elongated size fit perfectly on my older TOTO toilet. The perfect addition for my small secondary bathroom.
We have a Toto Neorest toilet and love it so we decided to buy this seat for another bathroom. It was very easy to install and we didn't have any issues. It fits our American Standard toilet perfectly and looks like it was made for it. The seat color is also a perfect match. All the features work great. The remote is also very easy to use. It's a high quality seat and we couldn't be happier.
"Only challenge is your plumbing. I needed to use a flexible hose to connect wall inlet to new split connector under tank.

Wireless remote with magnetic mount to wall is outstanding and the buttons are intuitive and allow temperature control with seat, water and dryer

We liked it so much we bought a second one so we have one on each floor"
"This is our first bidet seat. It will not be our last.
I installed this on a relatively new Toto Vespin Elongated two piece toilet. I am DIY guy for most things so my idea of simple may be skewed. The install of the seat itself is easy enough even if you are mildly handy . The plumbing connection is a breeze assuming your shut off works well. The power cord is located on the right side of the seat (as you are sitting). The reach of the cord varies depending on where your outlet is. Ideally you will want an outlet within two foot of the toilet. I am an electrician so I wasn’t concerned about adding an outlet but it certainly would have been an consideration if I had to hire it out.

For as big as the unit is the seat itself is a bit smaller than a standard elongated seat. I think that on purpose so you are in the right spot when its cleaning time. The features are abundant. The two presets are nice. I have the heating functions all at the minimum and everything is comfortable. The heated seat is what sold my wife. The stream of water is not overwhelming. I can’t comment on the front wash as it isn’t designed for men. The warm air dryer is effective. You will still want to dry off a bit with some toilet paper. We are a month in on this and it is the preferred spot now. I am debating where the next one will go. The remote is labeled in IKEA style hieroglyphics. There is a cheat sheet that mounts up with the remote holder(see photo). The remote sits in a cleat but is also magnetically held. There is a security screw included if you don’t want the remote to be removed.
Beware: once you go down this path you won’t want to “go” anywhere else."
"Bidets may seem a foreign and luaghable invention to most Americans. It did to me as well. However, I fell in love with the bidet while living in Asia. Upon returning to the US, I wanted to purchase a quality bidet for my bathroom. Well, Toto is the standard. Unfortunately, a full on Toto toilet with all the bells and whistles is a little pricey for my blood. So I compromised and purchased a unit that I could attach to my existing toilet. And while the Toto Washlet K300 may still seem a little pricey for some, it's a worthwhile compromise on cost while retaining the quality and included features for a Toto toilet. I highly recommend the K300 to anyone looking for a more sanitary restroom experience.

One thing to take into consideration if you puchase this model or any electric bidet, it needs to be plugged into an outlet within a couple of feet of the toilet. As an electrician, I installed a new GFCI outlet myself. But for most people it will require thw added cost of an electrician or good handyman. (Stay safe. Hire a qualified person to install an outlet.)"
This was very straight forward to install and works perfectly
"This bidet toilet seat works. It's comfortable to sit on the heated seat, especially during our Connecticut winters. Using a bidet is more hygenic — ""would you clean your car with paper towels?"" is the promotion. It saves toilet paper and its wrapping and shipping, and it reduces septic waste. A bidet is required by code for each bathroom in Europe. The water sprays are adjustable in pressure, direction and warmth, and they can be memorized for two users. The remote has icons that identify each function, and it was easy to mount on the wall by the toilet. The seat is easy to install — just change toilet seats, and connect the water pipe. It did require a new electric line to our bathroom, and that was more expensive than the Washlet. We now have four of these Washlets, and my daughter has bought two of them after using ours."
"Toto decided to go with two different hose routing designs. Therefore if you have a Drake model, you have to get this one or else the water and power lines won’t be hidden. An annoying non backwards compatible and anticonsumer engineering decision.

The washlet is also more of a round bowl in its seating dynamics. You’ll find that the toilet becomes a bit cramped. The largest negative is the lack of power for the backside wash. You’ll find 20 dollar washers on Amazon that provide more cleaning power so you don’t have to use multiple wipes."
"A toilet seat should sit there in silence unless its in use. Unfortunately I define 'in use' as 'pushed a button' and this seat defines it as 'sat down'. This one makes hissing and spitting sounds the moment you sit, whether you were planning to use the bidet functions or not. There are also auto bowl spritzing, deodorizer fan, and power deodorizer fan when you stand up. These latter features can be optionally turned off, but you can't stop the auto hissing and spitting when you sit. Want to pee in the night without waking your partner, not a choice. Want to install it in the guest bath for those guests that like a bidet, but avoid scaring those older relatives who weren't going to touch the remote anyway, not a choice. They are going to jump up in alarm and come tell you 'the toilet is leaking'.

To be fair, its possible to turn off the seat entirely and turn it on only when you want to use it, and then it is silent, but then its also no longer heated. The actual bidet functions, remote, etc are all worthy of the fact that this is a consistently highly rated seat."
"Would've given this a 5 star. Only reason for 4 star is the instructions for operation the remote are not as clear as we would have expected. But, we really love the bidet! It does take some getting used though."
"Let me tell you, the Toto K300 is the real MVP of my bathroom routine. This toilet seat is like a spa day for your butt. It's got all the bells and whistles you never knew you needed, like a heated seat, warm water bidet, and even a dryer to keep you feeling fresh and clean.

But that's not even the best part. The Toto K300 also has a built-in air purifier that eliminates any unpleasant odors. And let's be real, we all need a little help in that department from time to time.

The installation was a breeze, and I'm not even remotely handy. It took me all of ten minutes to get this bad boy up and running, and let me tell you, it was worth every penny. Now, I can't imagine ever going back to a regular old toilet seat.

If you're in the market for a throne fit for a king (or queen!), look no further than the Toto K300. Your booty (and your nose) will thank you."
"When the pandemic hit and the toilet paper shortage began, I bought one of the cheaper cold water bidet attachments as a proof of concept. I had never used a bidet, but needed something better than just paper. It worked great, but had always wished for an electric model for warm water (I'm in Dallas so the cold water wasn't that bad except on cold winter days).

We remodeled our Master bathroom in 2022 which was the perfect opportunity to add an outlet by the toilet for a powered bidet seat. Bought the K300 in mid-2022 and have been using it for a year now.

I'm a big guy at 320lbs and find that this doesn't always get everything clean. I think the stream is too focused and doesn't fan out enough for me. Almost always needs a wipe or two to finish it off. Due to this, the drying feature is worthless. I've tried all the settings, with no improvement.

Will continue to use as it's much better than paper alone, but for the price I expected better."
"Very comfortable, functional and not bulky. Fits well on the Toto Ultramax toilets. Remote is well designed and intuitive. Settings levels can be easily adjusted from the back of the remote. I trust the Toto brand and hope to get years of reliable service from these washlets."
"My butt grew very happy when using washlets on my trips to Japan. Heated seats, gentle warm water wash, air blow dry, deodorizing fan….. a revelation in decadent fanny care.

Back home in the US, Amazon Prime Day came and the discount price on this was too good to pass up.

Just now received it via UPS. A breeze to install. With a 52 page instruction manual, this washlet is smarter than me.

Maiden voyage: bliss. I no longer feel like a dirty foreigner in my own home.

My butt thanks TOTO and Amazon!"
"seat didn't lay flat to Toto toilet, had to shim it with shaved self adhesive rubber bumpers which wasn't cool for money spent ($800 with toilet), and their tech support was useless and unresponsive. back 2 bumpers didn't touch bowl by about 6mm and I was afraid of breaking it without shimming. Part of that is hinge design, part is defects in the TOTO porcelin toilet bowl rim not being perfectly flat. Unfortunately I didn't realize until toilet was installed, and it wasn't annoying enough to want to reinstall the toilet. So verify fit beforehand.

Other than that, works great so far. I got this specific model because it was the cheapest tankless model from Toto. First bidet so can't compare to other brands. Pressure was adequate, air dryer and seat warmer are more than sufficient(max setting too hot for me). Max water temp is quite warm, but not unpleasantly hot."
"I definitely get off the John feeling cleaner, more relaxed, and minus TP abrasion. Great for people with hemorrhoids. Worth the extra money to know I wouldn’t run out of warm water. Glad I made the purchase.

Reality check: 1) Your results may vary but I still use some TP. 2) If you have a hand held shower you can get as or more clean for a little more time but less money. 3) Simpler energy feature-just power off when not using; it only takes a few seconds to power on, self-clean and warm up. 4) Us guys need to aim well when standing to maintain a clean device.

Pro tip: with a little adjustment of your toosh the front jet gives an alternative angle for rear cleaning."
I'll never go back to a normal toilet. Just buy it.
It's good but I can't find the part A-12
"It cleans your tush the proper way and saves in toilet paper use. I would recommend this product. Toto is the leading bidet maker in Japan and Taiwan and is used in all the higher end hotels, restaurants, and many homes."
"I previously owned the Toto C200 because I needed a smaller “round” style fitting, but my new apartment has a standard elongated type toilet. So while I loooooved the C200, I had to decide between reordering a new C200 in the elongated style or upgrading to a newer / nicer Toto.

Honestly, bidets don’t really get much press and it’s really difficult to discern exactly how higher end models actually create a better experience. When you read the specs, they don’t seem that different.

I decided to go with the K300, and I’m happy to report the K300 actually does offer a lot more polish all around. Because Of the instant-hot-water feature, the entire seat is not nearly as chunky and tall in the back. Another very noticeable improvement is the spraying performance itself…which is of course the star of the show. Its… a LOT stronger than c200. There’s a big range to choose from so don’t worry- it’s not too strong if you like it gentle. Even the oscillation feature has a wider range of movement. The air dryer is stronger and reaches a hotter temp than C200 if you choose. the pre-mist function also somehow works better… no mess leftover in the bowl.

Overall, I’m really glad I decided to upgrade."
"I originally ordered a different bidet. One that was about half the price and provided almost all of the same benefits other than the remote control and unlimited warm water which has proven time and time again to be a wonderful. Installation was a little complicated because I bought a different adapter assuming this wouldn't work for a skirted toilet. Turns out, it comes with all you need and assuming your toilet isn't backed up directly against the wall, it'll work. Toto's adapter is proprietary and you would need a specialized item, probably - to get it to hook up otherwise, but fortunately, that wasn't my experience. Highly recommended if you can get it for a decent price. Great talking point when people come over."
"The c5 had about 20 seconds of hot water and it seems to go fast. The k300 takes 1 second to warm up compared to the c5 which is instantly warm, but the tankless water heater is totally worth the $100 more i paid for the k300. Got it on sale for $500 so if you can wait, the price fluctuates downwards. Looks better than the c5 too."
"Toto is the best. All my toilets are Toto's and this washlet goes well with them. The washlet itself will spoil your bottom, so much so that your bottom will be forlorn when it's without it (like at work). Yes it does a great job at what it's supposed to do. The electronic Air deodorizer works great, I have stopped using the vent fan in the bathroom because it's so effective. I also don't clean the bowl as often as I used to. The premist and EWATER seem to have a lot to do with that. The seat isn't exactly soft, but it's not uncomfortable and I have no problem with an extended sit on it, I do wish that it was a couple inches longer but again it's a non issue for me. I would absolutely purchase this washlet again and plan to outfit my other toilets with it in the future."
Luckily I had an outlet on the outside wall so having the electrician snake a wire into the bathroom wall near the toilet and install an outlet was possible. The water was secured at the valve at the wall and the fitting connecting the toilet tank disconnected. The kit contains a splitter connection that you attach to the existing flex hose and the other end to the toilet tank. Then you connect the toilet seat hose to the splitter. Seat itself attaches using a rubber system the you need to wet to push through the opening on the toilet top.
"I had high hopes for this bidet seat with auto wand cleaner, but wish I had bought the Brondell like I have before, because the seat is not as comfortable, the pressure is too low for the water and no night light on the Toto.I won't buy another one of these again!"
My husband wanted this after using one at a airbnb. Thanks for having a great product
This is a high quality item. No regrets as it has worked flawlessly.
"Received on-time, original Toto K300 box was inside another box with a little additional padding, which is good since this in an expensive item. Original box was unopened and perfect. I had to buy a 9"" supply line since the inlet adapter shortened the distance between supply and tank by a few inches. I didn't have to kink or spiral the line to make it fit. All required items were included in the box and the instructions were clear. Took me about 20 minutes to install because I wasn't in a hurry. Works great and I'm really liking it. Takes some practice but works as advertised. I would buy from this supplier again if my spouse would let me buy more for the other bathrooms."
"This is my second Toto Washlet and I’m disappoint in the remote. The seat features are the same as my old model which I was very happy with. You can adjust everything ( water, fan, seat temperature, water pressure, position of wand and cleansing action on this model. Wand position, water pressure and water temperature settings can be locked to individual users and this is where I’m disappointed. Unfortunately user icons, front or back and fan icons aren’t back lite, so at night you can’t see what your selecting without turning on the lights. Why have LED lights on water pressure and wand position when only adjust these when you first get the seat? True this is a minor inconvenience but at this price point Toto could have done better."
"I have been wanting to buy a bidet for years now but wanted to make sure that the one that I got really made a difference in the daily drop. This is another level of comfort and cleanliness, if you are thinking about it and have an elongated toilet with nearby power sockets, buy it.. The only downside, this would completely change how you view public restrooms.

This pairs with the Toto Drake like peanut butter and jelly."
"Highly recommend. The only thing I would like to share is READ your manual, it will 'self clean' at 2:30 AM if you use the default. I still need to figure out how to stop this feature. It's really great otherwise. Warm butt happy butt"
"After visiting Japan this was a must buy when I returned. I don’t know why we don’t have these on all our toilets here in the US. So far so good, zero issues and easy install. I can do my own plumbing and electrical so the install was easy for me. I would suggest if you don’t know how to do either hire someone to do it."
"I got stacked a bit when connecting the hose and went to home Depot to get ""insurance parts"". It's not needed. The installation is well planned. However the installation guide could be a bit clear for the DIYer. The 7/8 connector needs to be threaded with the tank directly with the 1/2inch branch goes to the seat hose. The rest is straightforward. Make sure you have a outlet nearby and toilet has enough space to put the seat on."
"Love the heated seat as well as the gentle washing feature that is adjustable. The dryer does not dry completely but it is adequate and reduces the amount of toilet paper used. I keep a small towel nearby to complete drying. While the instructions state that this unit can be installed by the purchaser, I had my plumber do the job since it required connecting with the existing water source. The continuous water warmer works well for an unlimited amount of time."
I love the warm seat and the hot water never run out. I wish I could of bought this sooner. The reason for 4 stars is because of the cost. The cost is kinda high. If you can afford it. This would be the one I recommend.
"My house has had a bidet for roughly 2 years at this point. Originally, we got one of the standard, low cost bidets just to see if it was worth it. Decided it was time to upgrade since we have now been converted.

This bidet is feature packed. I literally can't use the other bidet anymore, let alone a normal toilet seat. The heated seat and water are fantastic. The water is instantly warm and have never had an issue with the temperature needing to warm up.

The deodorizer I thought was a gimmick. It is not. I don't know how it works, but it does. No more walking into a disgusting smelling bathroom after someone. In fact, you won't even smell yourself.

The customization, the remote, everything is fantastic. I highly recommend this bidet."
"I never knew it was as possible to love a toilet seat… I can’t seem to stay off it. In fact I’m writing this review from the soft warmth of the heated seat. I don’t leave the house much since I got this seat out of fear I may have to use an inferior seat somewhere else. The remote is east to use, the seat installed easily and works great! Only buy one of these wonderful devices if you are not afraid of never wanting to leave home again."
"I've used cold water bidets for years and they work great. But when you decide you want to level up android get a product that not only washes you with warm water 💦 but then afterwards air dryers you, this is the sweet spot for my money. I ended up waiting android buying when it was on sale and have ZERO regrets.

If you want a bidet that opens the lid or has a night light, I guess you can spend another $400. To me it wasn't worth it an this product is recommended for sure!!"
"I used to think a bidet was bougie but let me tell ya, it’s the best thing ever. The heated toilet seat alone is worth it. The features are easy to use and lovely. Endless hot water? Awesome. Don’t judge until you try it. You’ll be a believer in no time."
"This is the 4th washlet I have had in as many decades. Do note that a slightly less functional VEVO sells for about 1/2 the price and may be a good option for those who are less fussy. Do note that in case you encounter unexplained water loss, as happened to us, you should check for leak from the toilet fitted with this model since its automatic rinse and noise masking function tends to obscure the leak."
"It was fairly easy to install although I thought the instructions were a bit confusing/lacking in clarity. So far, all the features are working as described. The only problem with the unit is that it does not clean as well as I thought it would. I almost always need at least two rinse-dry-wipe cycles, where for the price paid there should be only one cycle needed (be even better if no wiping was needed)."
"Play Video
 Fits perfectly on the Toto toilet base we got and the heated seat is absolutely my favorite feature (it’s Michigan and in our guest bathroom in particular, can get really cold!) The bidet, easy-to-use/program remote, and deodorizer all work beautifully so far. I do have to have the electrician come in to put an outlet so I’m not running a power strip from our sink outlet to the toilet but wanted to make sure we liked it first. Very easy to install and absolutely would recommend it."
"Works great even tho i dont have the correct toilet.
I have a round toilet and this was made for a elongated toilet but it still fits good enough."
"It was easy to install with great instructions. I like the shorter height (lower profile) than older models that used a tank to heat the water. Tankless water heater is great for not running out of hot water and reducing the overall size of the unit. Plenty of options with buttons on the front and back of the remote. Spraying a mist of water on the toilet bowl before you use it helps to prevent ""matter"" from sticking to the walls. I've only had it a few weeks, but no movement/wiggling of the seat. Nice and sturdy. Great improvement over dry toilet paper."
"First experienced a Bidet on vacation. As soon as I came home, I researched and found this one from Toto. Like the slim design (no water reservoir as it heats water on demand) and the efficiency functions (turns off heated seat during 'down times'). The dryer function is also great. I feel cleaner and more comfortable every time! I have a skirted toilet so had to purchase a special adapter in order to fit the hose but other than that, its been great so far!"
Great performance as expected. Should have had one much earlier.
"Heard about bidets and how wonderful they are. Now that we have used on for 1 month now, I couldn't agree more. The Toto product seems top of the line with great features and ease of use."
"I have had this Washlet for about 2 days. It came in early and was a breeze to install. I had to run a 20 amp circuit but this wasn't too bad as I had a junction box nearby. If you have the money to splurge I would go for it. No more toilet paper or hand washing :)

I was surprised how nice this model is. The water is warm continuously and cleans you well. The heater doesn't dry you super fast but it does work. If you are in a hurry you can always use some tp to speed things up."
"loving it so far. The controls are easy straight forward to use. The toilet seat was easy to install. At first it wasn't latching properly, so make sure the rubber stoppers are completely underneath the bidet for it to latch on properly. it does get a bit loose sometimes. I hope it does not break down. the endless hot water is nice. Got it on sale for $460. great deal! Toto is a great brand."
It is really easy to install and works well.
"The instructions were confusing to me, but I was able to determine how to install unit. All parts were well made. The remote control can be a bit overwhelming, but that is the price of having the features of this unit. It does a good job of cleaning my rearend. One must use the spray and dryer for longer than expected to do it's job."
We had a Toto that after seven years broke so we replaced it with this super Duper remote control one. It is so much quieter and love it!
Arrived broken. Just like the others said. The box wasn't damaged but the base of the seat was cracked.
"Super easy install. With really high quality hardware for the water connections. Bought another bidet for my guest bathroom and doesn’t compare to the TOTO quality. I do hope in the next version that comes out, the remote gets upgraded to be in landscape mode with a screen. the smart energy saving function was a bonus surprise. Learns when I use toilet in the day and preheats seat and otherwise turns off this function. It’s a splurge but worth it!"
I love this Bidet. TOTO is famous and makes best toilet products in Japan. Therefore it was an easy decision to purchase this bidet though I did a lot of research....My decision paid off. Our family loves using it. Great product! It's a bit more than we wanted to pay but worth it. Definitely recommend this product. Thanks!
"If you install the base plate all the way forward, it will sit on top of the rubber pieces and keep them in place. Worked great for us and seat doesn't move at all.

I go to Japan often and didn't think it would compare, but this thing exceeded expectations. High quality. Definitely recommend"
Best purchase ever. This thing is legit and me ole arse could not be happier or cleaner.
If you have any type of hemorrhoid issues you know that using toilet paper does not always get the job done regarding cleanliness. The bidet washlet will cleanse your anal with warm water making you feel truly clean while adding a sense of healing relief to the anal area. My daughter had a baby and swears it made her feel so relaxing in her areas during the weeks after vaginal delivery.
"Switching to a ToTo Toilet Bidet has changed our entire Home.
It's a feeling ..... clean, efficient, cost savings, germ reducing ....
Cannot say enough how much this one little investment changed our entire home."
"I never would’ve thought that I would be writing a review for a toilet seat, but here we are. This thing is awesome and I had to share! I didn’t know what I had been missing all these years. Only issue is since we’ve installed it I have noticed my family spends more time in the bathroom…

A friend of ours has a bidet / washlet and is always talking about it, even at dinner (awkward I know right?). So I decided to do some research even if it was just so I could have a knowledgeable conversation with him about it (LOL). Turns out after doing some research, seems people other than my friend really love these things so I decided I would give it a shot.

Now I didn't want to spend too much on this but I also didn't want to get a cheap unit from a company I'd never heard of before. That's what lead my to this unit from Toto. Also the other challenge I ran into is we have a Kohler Santa Fe toilet and the bowl on it is curved so there was some concern that these units may not even fit on my toilet. But this KC2 unit looked like it would fit and had some nice features so I went ahead and pulled the trigger.

The install was really easy. The seat has a nice adjustable plate that makes it simple to fit on different sized toilets. With a little adjustment, the seat fits great on my Santa Fe as you can see in the pictures.
The only issue I had was my bathtub is real close to our toilet so hooking up the water line was a tight fit. After one trial and error (with a leak), I decided to connect the water line and the washlet line to the adapter first, the screw the adapter to the bowl. That solved the problem and to me was an easier way to do it. It took me just about 35 minutes from the time I started the install to the time I was able to wet and warm my backside.

The heated seat is an awesome feature especially in the winter. The water spraying on my under carriage, well that takes some getting used to. It still surprises me every time even though I know it's coming. But it works great once you get comfortable with it. The washlet has some nice features to that you can change the pressure and temperature of the water to your liking. There is also a drying feature that helps dry you off a little. There is even a special cleaning feature for the ladies! The only other thing is the seat is a little smaller than I'm used to but it's not bad and is real comfortable to sit on.

So in the end, I'm surprised how much I like this washlet. But I really do. We stayed in a hotel over the weekend, and I'm embarrassed to say I missed my toilet seat (LOL). Just feel fresher and cleaner during the day and have not had any chaffing now that I'm using a lot less toilet paper during the week. I'm looking forward to talking toilet seats with my friends at dinner now!"
"The KC2 is perfect if you're looking for a simple bidet seat with everything you need. I have two of the higher-end Washlet models in my home already. I wanted another one to go in my powder room, so it didn't need all the bells and whistles like the two I already have. This model is perfect because it has everything that makes a bidet seat functional and useful, but not really any of the extra features that are more like luxuries.

It cleans you with warm water and has a warm dryer for afterwards. The water has adjustable pressure settings that you can change to your liking. The dryer helps you ""finish up"", and even though I still blot dry with a bit of toilet paper to speed things up, the warm air is a nice touch. I guess the heated seat is a luxury, but its one that you don't want to skip out on... like being wrapped in warm towels when you sit.

I do love the extra features on my S550e models, but the KC2 is all I need as an extra addition to my home. If you don't think you need all the luxury features available on some of the other models, this is the one!"
"This is my 2nd TOTO Washlet. The other one, bought 5 years ago and still going strong, has all available features. I ended up turning all the extra special features off and bought this KC2 because it has the essential features and a bit extra. And I prefer manual lid open/close. It's fine. It's perfect. It's what I want. Love it. Super easy to install. Adding the extra outlet was easy too. Make sure it's GFCI. Check out YouTube videos for help on that aspect."
We have enjoyed our bidet and it has worked flawlessly
"Love my Toto bidet. I did a lot of research before buying it and even bought a non-powered one before returning prior to install it for the current product.
Pros: heated water, front and rear wash with push of a button wand positioning. Dryer feature is fair and probably would be better if I chose to sit longer. I just keep a wash cloth by the bidet and Pat dry. Toilet seat is comfortable. Of course how one positions their bum also which parts the spray hits. Love the self closing toilet seat. The bidet buttons are intuitive and easy to use. The only thing you really have to remember is to hit the stop to turn off the water flow.
Cons: Must have an electric outlet near the bidet. Hired a plumber for this. This Toto bidet model does not have the endless heated water feature but has enough warm water to get the job done.
Overal, very satisfied with purchase."
We really ! love our Toto ! It has taken the sting out of winter always giving a warm comforting sensation when you sit down. The 'wash' attachment is very soothing and pleasant too. It won't win any beauty contest but a must have device for cold climates.
Seriously- this seat is the bomb. First you sit yourself down on a heated seat- love it! Then action- tailored to your preference- to finish the dryer! Yeah baby! I’m also going to introduce this to my 97 year old mother who has reverted to her childhood and hates to take a shower! Win win!
"We really wanted to LOVE this and had been waiting to buy it. I am shocked that I never saw any comments on what I am writing here.
1. The wand moves forward to clean the vagina. However, it moves from the rear position spraying water (and feces) as it goes and that mess reaches the vagina before the wand has fully extended with clean water! AND, if I am sitting all the way back on the seat (which you have to so the thin part of the seat doesn't cut your thighs), then you MUST move and shift around a lot to get that front wand action to be in the right place.
2. The LOWEST water pressure was HARD, especially on the lady parts.
3. The LOWEST water temperature was HOT, especially on the lady parts.
I hope this helps!"
"Bought this after our trip to Japan where many of the toilets we used has this water cleaning feature to reduce the use of toilet paper and provide a better cleaning of your bum. My wife likes it. So when we are back home after the trip, we bought this bidet after looking thru different reviews. Also Toto is a Japanese brand that we saw in many of the toilets we used in Japan, common sense say that if the brand is that popular in Japan, they must did something right. The bidet provides a good heating temperature for the seat (3 settings) and keeps our bums warm during the cold morning usage. The water stream and strength is also at a good point where it wasn't too harsh but strong enough to wash the bums clean. Although if you want to have your bum dry right away, you still need some toilet paper to dry. You can use the blower that comes with it to blow dry your bum but you will have to sit there for a few additional minutes. This bidet has other settings that provide enough features for a beginner usage at a reasonable price. There are different models of bidet out there that provides more features but at a much higher price. It all depends on what you are look for. Comparing to another brand of bidet we bought that uses a remote control, we prefer the hardwired one. Two reasons, the first is we don't have to look for the remote every time we need to use the bidet features as many times after usage, we just randomly put the remote down and the next person has to find it. The second is the remote could malfunction and you can't use any of the features and this happens to us. The bidet is useless until we get a replacement remote. Lucky we are still within the warranty period and can get a free replacement without extra out of pocket cost. The replacement remote cost about $80 in addition to the shipping cost. So if you do get a bidet, doesn't have to be Toto, but any brand, I suggest get the hardwired ones and not the ones that use a remote."
Life has been greatly improved after using the automatic bidet. The only problem is the spray water doesn’t keep the same temperature - it’s warmer in the beginning but becomes cold after a few seconds.
Bidet
"Smaller then I thaught ut would be, difficult for a man to use."
"The bidet works great. No complaints about the product itself. BUT, there is the additional cost of installing a special circuit breaker and dedicated line into the WC (toilet). This by itself was $435. If I had been aware upfront I probably would have passed on the purchase."
"My first experience with a bidet was after my job sent me to Japan in 2019 to train team members. The hotel I stayed in had this same bidet. The only difference was the one in the hotel had a light on it. Aside from that this one is actually a bit better.

When I got back I looked for one to purchase but they all were nearly $1000.00 including this one especially this brand! I almost didn’t want to post this because I feel like this is a steal!!!

I never spend this much money randomly. I did lots of Research! And I am very good at researching because I do it for a living. Btw I must add that I never really do reviews unless I’m really upset about a purchase. I have used this for 2 days now and seriously I am soooooo happy I spent the money for this. Like literally I started the payment plan purchase because I was so apprehensive about spending this much on a toilet seat! But in Japan they have these in most corporate environments. So I used them whenever I needed. There is nothing like it. And this one even has the air dryer. I thought I wouldn’t use it but for real it is pretty awesome. If used correctly u will use less paper. The key is to turn on the dryer right before you blot with paper until you are ready to stand up.

Can’t believe I’m doing this review but I’m blown away even though I’ve experienced this before a few years ago."
I like it
"Still waiting for my refund . The seat was very nice, but was the incorrect size. I was approved for a refund and sent it back still waiting for the refund. Could you please check on the status. Thank you!"
What can I say. It's WONDERFUL.
"I wanted one for several years. Went to daughters and she had basic one and it was good. But this has extras, like seat warmer controls for pressure and water temp. My husband scoffed at it. Then he starting using it and decided to get one for other bath. He even wants one for his shop now!"
Very pleased with the washlet--Toto QUALITY all the way--as expected. It's a replacement and the price saving at Amazon is almost $200 off MSRP--so it was a no-brainer. Genuine article in Toto branded box with warranties and manuals. I am very glad that I opted to have an authorized local Toto installer do the job. Depending on your toilet (mine is a Toto that was previously fitted with a Toto washlet) and length of the flush valve connecting stem--the installation is not an easy DIY. The installer had to jigger quite a bit to get the t-fitting to fit. So beware that you have adequate clearance before going down the DIY rabbit hole.
"Warm water,heated seat,"
"We love our bidgit , it’s our second one , first one lasted 6 years , but someone used bleach to clean and your no supposed to , this is a basic one but works great happy to have a warm seat , works great everyone should have them in there home ,"
"After using a different brand for years, this brand may now be my new favorite. Really like the features and how it sprays. Easy to use."
"I’ve grown up with TOTO bidets. And without this I do not feel clean all day. I purchased 2 each for a new home.
TOTO is the trust worthy for the quality and customer services. And the seller of this product “MIG equipment LLC” is fully back us up for the questions.
I am super happy with this product and recommend to anyone interested in warm water bidets."
I bought based on Japanese engineering and that Japan has been using these types of toilet seats much longer than the west. Very happy with the performance and ease of installation. Fortunately I have a GFCI power outlet near my toilet.
This has been everything expected and more.
"If you own a one-piece or two-piece toilet with skirted bottom (this includes Toto), you may need to buy some additional supplies. It should have come with these as part of the washlet, but it doesn't. They also don't tell you in their specifications or ""Instructions""
1. the seat anchor uses M6 screws, in case you need to buy shorter screws.
2. You will need a different t connector than what came with it. You need a 3/8""x3/8""x1/2"" t-connector. Geniebidet sells one and there are a couple of here.
Trying to install has been a huge hassle trying to find these things. For something that is over $300, I expected the installation to go smoother or at least come with two types of t-connectors.
I am sure it's great once installed. Just save yourself some trouble and get the t-connector if you have these types of toilets. I will adjust the review after I am able to use it."
Nice and Fit!!!!!!!!
"Still getting used to using this product. I thought I was getting a bidet with a warm air dryer because that’s what the product details stated, but this model does not have an air dryer. I decided to keep it anyway as it had most of the features I thought were needed, and it’s the first one I have purchased."
"This was so easy to install (for someone who can’t even put together a four-legged Ikea desk). Love the heated seat and warm air dryer! It’s super comfortable and helps wake me up on the morning before I cozy up to my coffee :) However, I do wish the hot water lasted a bit longer… maybe next time we’ll go for a model with endless hot water. New to bidets and not disappointed at all…"
All of my friends are wanting to buy one! It works perfectly. No problems.
Preparing for surgery and grandson helped with the installation. It went smoothly and was a good time clean the whole area.
"product working well. hard to install the rubber plug to toilet, but rest was easy."
"I didn’t know I was buying a used Washlet. This was my second Washlet. The first was from a different source on Amzn. This one came in poorly repackaged. There was water in the hose and clear bags. The Washlet finish was hazy (scratched). Other than that, it was serviceable. I’m not satisfied due to the unsanitary implications."
"We have been fortunate to travel to Japan. TOTO is THE brand there, and it is just as wonderful here in the US. The installation was a breeze (if you have an electrical outlet) and the cleaning is just as easy as before. I'm so glad we got this. We might have to get another one for our other bathroom. I think guests would like it as much as we do."
This was an excellent buy everyone that uses it loves it especially the heated seat must buy !
"Needed this for my aging mom. It's the entry level bidet that washes men and women, pulsating wash, heated seat and water, has dryer, and soft closing lid."
"I just purchased this product and was excited about getting it installed and using it. Being able to wash my rear instead of having to wipe seamed like a great idea. After all, you don't just wipe your hands after getting them dirty, you wash them.

The installation went smoothly enough, but when I attached the washlet to the mounting hardware, it did not feel like a solid connection. The washlet has lots of wiggle room and moves around a lot. When i sit down on a toilet I want it to feel solid and sturdy, not moving around underneath me. For $300 I expect more quality and a tighter fit."
"We just installed our TOTO WASHLET KC2 and give it a big thumbs up. The user friendly controls, heated seats, and customizable water pressure are a plus. The dryer's perfect aim is also appreciated. If you want to feel clean and fresh after your next visit to the commode...you need to try this out."
"I’ve seen review of people receiving broken products, and unfortunately it happened with one of the two Washlets that I bought. I would recommend you to reconsider buying this product if are currently researching for it."
The Toto was easy to install. Easy for my 89 yr old father to operate. Game changer for him! I bought one years ago for 3 times the price. This was a great value
"I used to own a Toto C 100, it was an entry model which does its job adequately. I needed a replacement so after some research this KC 2 is a newer model sold and shipped by AMAZON. I also felt more confident buying from Amazon because of its reputation, but the day after I received the product they reduced the price enough to wipeout my 5% rebate, ouch. Not mention the new model supplies less warm water. its seat has 4 pegs under to detect the motion, they are not even so the seat is uneven when seated."
Toilet seat does not sit stable on toilet bowl. Will slide left and right. Actual water hose cleaning device works OK.
I've had other toilet seat bidets. This is superior in every way.
"I was excited to install it. It was easy to install (Needed to get electrical power hooked up so paid an electrician to add an outlet close by) -- It worked good for a week or so. Must mention that there is a delay from you press button to get a water stream. Besides it, the control buttons started to malfunction after a week of use (pressing a button some times did not work -- water won't stop or won't start, etc). Also, started to smell burning plastic so we decided to return it and install a simple bidet."
"I was looking forward to using this product.
After installing the product, I tried to use it as soon as possible, but the wand was still out.

I looked into the cause and found that part of it was damaged.

I was terribly disappointed to receive such a product after having been looking forward to it all these days."
do not believe that TOTO produces such a defect. Seat supporting legs missing one. I found the problem while down installation
Came complete with jet black ass hairs.. Selling as new? Wow.
"so the real issue is that the heated water reservoir is small so there's just enough to make a mess, not really clean anything. Honestly its worse than nothing."
We just moved to my new house with the plumber installed this toilet seat for us and we just started using it. I realize it does not have the drying function that I paid extra for. My return window just shut.
"I bought this for my daughter because the old one (A different brand needed reprogramming. The seat color also faded to dark brown) stopped working.
Since we have a Toto brand toilet, the new Toto bidet I bought was just perfect fit.

My daughter tells me it works great."
"This is my 3rd electric washlet so nothing had to be wired. There was already a GFCI outlet and surge protector for power next to the toilet and I had several spare parts from previous washlets if needed.

The first I had in the US after a non-electric seat was a bottom-of-the-line Brondell that I picked up on eBay for about $150. It was adequate but began popping the GFCI for no apparent reason that I could find although nothing else seemed to be out of order. Went the safety way and tossed it purchasing a Korean brand Novita in 2016. It lasted all the way until September 2022 when the control buttons on the control arm stopped working, or intermittently at best. There was no response from the place purchased so I started looking for something new after opening up the Novita and deciding I didn't want to troubleshoot it any further (3 screws and a lot of plastic snaps).

I've used everything from simple National brands in Japan to the toilet-seat-saluting, remote and non-touch flush, music playing, UV sanitizing, 1-piece toilets (a friend had a his and hers installed in his house in Kumamoto). In Japan, it seemed that Toto was the brand that set the standards so I quickly looked at Toto washlet features. I didn't want to be saluted when I approached the toilet and I wanted to keep it simple, so the Toto KC2 had what I really wanted, specifically, a sealed seam seat. After opening up the Novita, I saw that there are a lot of places around the seams that you can't clean. This model, the 3024, was the cheapest that had this feature and was a Toto.

If you've installed one already, a second is simple. You turn the water off, flush the toilet, unhook the supply hose, and put in the ""T."" You then install the bowl attachement plate with 2 bolts. Toto has a different kind of mounting that has rubber inserts that go through the holes on the toilet from the top and the mounting adjusts in all directions. You don't have to work under the toilet. However, my American Standard Vortex toilet's seat-mounting holes were too small even with water and soap. I couldn't get them through at first even putting large washers on the bottom of the bolt from underneath and putting as much weight as I could on it. I finally got a hammer, put the bolt into the rubber fitting from the top, and slowly tapped it through (with lots of soap). Tapping it slowly got the rubber compressed enough to push it through and ready for the plate. Once that was in, you just snapped in the seat to see if it lined up with the outside of the toilet rim and sat properly, removed it and tightened the bolts. I then screwed the water supply into the ""T"" and plugged the electric into the surge protector.

The controls are attached on a control arm on the 3024. there is no remote (the remote is on the 3074). It's all pretty straight forward except for the Energy Saver and Timer. The Energy Saver is supposed to be ""Auto"" so that's how I have it set. The symbol with the leaf is lit up indicating that it's active. You can also set the seat to be off for 6 or 9 hours by turning on the timer when you want it to turn off (If you want it to turn off for 6 hours at night, you could turn on the 6-hour timer (1 push of the timer button) at 1 AM and it would become active at 7 AM. I just have it set at auto.

The amount of water is greater than the Novita, and the response time for off and on for water and air is almost instantaneous. I had to wait a bit for the Novita to wind up.

Features:
Heated Seat: 3 settings
Heated water in a tank (not infinite): 3 settings
Heated blower: 3 settings
Pressure: 5 settings
Pulsate
Front and Rear Bidet
Forward and Backward positioning
Auto energy saver
Timer energy saver
Sealed seams (not open on seat)

Does NOT have:
eWater+ (somehow breaks existing salt in the water into chlorine and sodium ions for disinfection)
Auto wand CLEAN
Pre-mist
UV
Seat salute, auto flush, sounds and other bells and whistles you may come across in Japan.

Hopefully, this will last longer than the Novita, which I liked while it worked."
"This is my first washlet purchase and I am very pleased. The installation for the Toto KC2 was very easy. If you have trouble deciphering the written instructions, download the BILT app and it walks you through everything. The control panel is very user friendly, easy to read and easy to use. It offers multiple temperatures settings for the spray, the heated seat and the dryer. The heated seat is awesome! You can set a timer for the water and seat to heat up or you can use the ""smart"" feature and it will learn your patterns. The only feature that doesn't do much is the dryer. It works fine, but you would have to sit there a long time to get dry. I have heard this is an issue with most washlets, so I'm not concerned. Overall, a great product that is easy to use and works well."
The washout has no problems. I had a terrible time making plumbing connections that did not leak. Perhaps that is just my old age.
Love the product
"Fit on a round toilet, but please be advised a round seat is a different order number."
Excelente articulo para tenerlo en el servicio sanitario del hogar
"El producto llegó roto de la botonera, aunque no afecta el funcionamiento. Lo recibí en el tiempo indicado por el vendedor. Excelente producto muy recomendable."
"Never having had a bidet toilet before, we were unsure if we'd like and adjust to this bidet seat. This product has many the luxury features -- heated seat, wand-cleaning, pre-use rinse, dryer. I got this model instead of the auto sensor open-close one because I saw that one in a model display, and I was convinced the constant open/close of toilet seat every time some walked into the bathroom would be annoying. The S300E does make some noise when it's heating the water, rinsing the bowl, or cleaning the wand, but the noise is temporary. The seat is narrow in front, but since we're sitting on the back of the seat, the front narrowness doesn't bother us. The round-front bowl is much smaller than the elongated bowl version and more difficult for men when sitting.
Installing wasn't so bad, but we did have to have a wall plug installed near toilet.
Overall, the product works wonderfully and is a joy to use. Will check back in if unit does not stand the test of time."
This is one of the best purchases/investments I've made. In 2017 I had a bad fall down a flight of stairs. I shattered left arm and broke right wrist. I ordered this unit for obvious reasons and it has performed even better than I expected. I thought I was only going to need it for a couple months. Here I am five years later and I feel like I can't live without it. I can't tell you anything about other brands but this thing runs like my Toyotas. It performs as advertised and works as good as it did the day I installed it in the Spring of 2017. Great product and I give it the highest rating possible.
If you open the box and find the T fitting to have the older style metal connection to the fill valve go to a hardware store and buy a neoprene washer to replace the small thin washer that is supplied with the unit. I got mine at ACE hardware for $.45. The original washer is too small to fit the bottom of the fill valve in most toilets and will result in leaking. After changing to the new washer there were no leaks. The newer design gray plastic fittings work very well and make the installation much easier. You have to be very carefull to not get the metal connection cross threaded. If that happens you may have to get a new fill valve for the toilet.
"We went to japan a few years ago and we loved the toilet seats. Heated water, heated seat, heated air dry... luxury! so much fun, such a conversation piece. I've had it about 1 month now and we love it.
Really all we wanted was heated water in the front (ladies only) & back (everyone). We could do without the seat warmer, lighted bowl, pre-mist, etc. I picked this more expensive model because the other cheaper one (C200) has a larger rear area, and looks weird and awkward. Also I understand the water is heated in a tank.. and this C300 the water is heated on the fly - seems worth it to me for unlimited streams of heated water.

The biggest downside is the seat hole is small on the rounded model - I'm a large man and the smaller opening is an acceptable trade off for amazing features of warm water spraying you! The alternative was buying an in-wall toilet with elongated bowl, which would have put the price tag into the multiple thousands of dollars. Not the right choice for us. If you have large people in your household, this may be too small for you, and I would consider replacing the toilet with an elongated model so you can get the extra space in the front.

Installation for me took an extra trip to home depot to get extra fittings, we have a very limited space for the plumbing behind our toilet, so that presented extra challenges, but if you have a normal setup, it is very easy to install. All of the hardware is of the highest quality."
"The spray pressure is too low even on the highest setting, and the pattern is a bit wide, so it soaks your entire posterior without actually cleaning off all the poop or blood.

You definitely need a towel after this, or you could use a lot of toilet paper and get little pieces of it all over you.

I much prefer the C200 Washlet, which has an actual jet of water that will get you clean.

The bowl spraying is convenient if you don’t have this installed near a bedroom. I hardly ever have to clean that toilet anymore. This feature was great when it was in a guest bath far away from the bedrooms in my house, but in our new house we have it installed close to a bedroom and it is unbelievably annoying. You can’t disable the self-cleaning feature, and it will wake you up when it runs late at night.

I do like how it lights up. This is a benefit at night, especially in a guest bath.

We have had it for four years now, and it has completely ceased to function properly. First, it started doing the bidet spray when it was meant to be cleaning the wand after use, spraying the wall across from the toilet. Now it has completely reversed these two functions. It will not spray on the bidet functions for front or back, but when you get off the toilet, it attempts to clean the wand and sprays the wall. Useless, and this cost us $1000.

The heated seat feature has been dysfunctional for two years. Sometimes it works sometimes it doesn’t. It seems to just not work at all now.

The remote stopped working after about a year and a half. Luckily, I still had another Toto remote around for the seat that this one replaced and they seem to be universal.

I will be replacing this with another C200 Washlet. Honestly, I’m annoyed that I put up with this stupid thing for four years."
"I am in love with Toto. For long time I postpone buying one (price is not a joke, and an outlet in is need to be installed as well). Finally, we got one. Installation was easy; it fit our non-Toto toilet just fine. It was a little bit too sensitive to movement around it and was ""greeting"" me by spraying E-water every time I were visiting bathroom for other reasons, so I solved it with a piece of paper covering that sensor. Now it reacted only on person's weight. It has a capability to store setting preferences for two people, water is hot and seat is warm - all adjustable to one's taste. Drying with fan takes a long time, so most of the time I omit that feature using a small towel instead. It sprayed a bowl before and after, keeping it clean longer. It is capable to learn your usage schedule and saving energy when not in use. It will be more anatomically correct to be cleaned from front to bottom, however for that you will have to get a real bidet. The only problem I have now - standing in line to go in my bathroom where Toto is installed. Unfortunately :-) my family loves it too. And, as usual, it is hard to live without it after we got spoiled."
"I tried to go with this model after a bunch of researches online. couple of reasons: 1) it looks nice comparing lower price models. 2) instant warm water always 3) not too many auto sensors like pricy ones.
Have not really used for too long, but here are some observations:
1) warm seat is really nice. it seems it keeps warm all the time, probably a little bit extra electricity bill. not sure how energy saving mode really helps this.
2) like other mentioned, the water problem could be more powerful. for me, I often use toilet tissues to make sure I am clean. it usually takes longer than expected time.
3) the auto sensor is really annoying, everytime I am close to the toilet it pre fog the bowl and assume I will do some business, this is really over reacting. I am not sure the auto learning will eventually correct this.
4) the installation really took me long time and damaged two flushing valves. I had to visit home depot twice before a guy in home depot convinced it should fit and surprisingly the third one fit well and went on very smoothly and no leak. I saw similar hard installation report from others.
5) overall this is apparently over priced production. I guess I am okay with it, it is something luxury anyway."
"I installed this as the instructions stated but it had a leak between the toilet and the included T fitting. The thin flat washer they provide with the unit (see picture) does not work to provide a good seal. I ended up having to go to the hardware store and purchasing a rubber cone washer (see circled picture). That fixed the leak and now all is good.

Likes:
- The water is instantly warm.
- Easy to install.
- It has an oscillation function – moves wand back and forth to cover a larger area.
- You can save custom settings for two people.

Dislikes:
- Had to purchase a better washer to stop the leak.
- I wish it had a dedicated deodorizer button. If you want to use the deodorizer, you have to put it on automatic mode. This turns the deodorizer fan on every time you sit on the seat. I want the deodorizer on only when I need it."
"BLUF: It will fit on a Kohler K-3386 Rialto...but just barely! See my photos for just how tight a fit. You will need to ensure the mounting bracket screws are flush with their very rear position setting or else the seat will not lock in place. The water line and power fit snugly to one side and still leave just enough room for access to the ""emergency"" buttons.

Pros:
- 2 user setting mode but anyone can adjust the settings on a per-use basis
- Seat heater works great
- Continuous warm water (didn't run out during a 5-min demonstration using a clear cup to stop the splash)
- Air Dryer (caution the max setting gets HOT)
- e+ water to help keep your toilet clean (no chemicals, just ionized water)

Cons:
- Tight fit on round french-curve toilets by Kohler
- Costly
- Opening is more narrow than a regular toilet
- Saved User Settings can't hold different air dryer temps

Very happy with this bidet seat. After a recent trip where I stayed at a newer Vegas hotel, I was reminded of the wonderful toilets I'd experienced in Japan since every suite at this particular hotel also has a TOTO washlet. This Bidet seat puts the older one at that hotel to shame in looks, styling, and ability to produce constant hot water.

Not wanting to change the entire toilet, I ordered the round TOTO Washlet in hopes it would fit. It does fit but, you will need to take your time with making sure the mounting bracket is set to the farthest rear setting. The seat bumpers close and rest against the toilet perfectly. You may notice one bumper to the side closest to the manual controls does not rest against the bowl when not seated. This appears to be due to the bumpers being a few hairs shorter to accommodate the seat sensor switch. The sensor switch avoids surprise sprays if someone pushes buttons on the control without being seated.

Both cleaning buttons have TWO settings even before you chose intensity, plus, heat or oscillation. Press the BACK or FRONT button once for softer or narrow spray respectively, Press either button again in succession for intense or wide spray. Bottom line, if you feel the spray isn't intense enough, you can press the same wash button a second time and then increase the intensity controls to the side to get more pressure.

If the mounting plate were just a 1/2inch longer towards the front, and the seat clasps moved to accommodate the change, this Washlet would likely be a universal fit for any toilet.

I can attest to all the great reviews others have mentioned. This toilet seat has an auto eco mode that will even learn when to ramp up the seat temp based on previous usage! If that doesn't fit your needs, you can set the manual timer to cycle at 3,6, or 9 hour stretches where it will go in to low-power mode.

The other users comments on issues and problems with S350e's auto open/close feature led me to get the S300e instead. If you have a euro-style water closet with the toilet separate from the rest of the bathroom, don't mind making some sensor modifications, or have a partitioned area for the toilet in your main restroom, the added night light and auto open/close might be worth a look."
"This would have been 5 stars but I deducted one star for installation. First of all, the instruction manual doesn’t really explain how to install the T junction fitting to the water source. I found a video by Toto on YouTube, however, and followed it exactly. End result was water spewing out all over the place. I spent nearly two hours fidgeting with it. Ultimately, I followed advice here and elsewhere and ordered TOTO THU9090R for about $25. With that part it took literally 5 minutes. Why would you not include this part with the product? I believe a conical rubber washer probably would also have worked. The problem is with the connection to the tank and/or the washer they include. It doesn’t make a tight seal and you get a mess. To be clear, some folks have reported being fine without the additional part. In my case it was absolutely essential.

Other than that it works fine. We have these at work so I knew what to expect. One thing that I find a little annoying is the sensor. Every time I go in the bathroom it fires up in expectation.

All in all I’m happy with it but make sure you get the right parts for the connection. Unless you need a new electrical socket I don’t think you need professional installation."
"We decided to install this Toto Washlet after reviewing and researching through my friends in Japan. I was not sure if I can install it by myself. To my surprise, it was so easy to install in our small bathroom. It took less than one hour by setting up, plugged in, and connected it to the water faucet. Though we had to hire an electrician to install the GFCI outlet in the bathroom, it was not so difficult or expensive. All the parts came with the unit perfectly fit, and there was no water leak. All of our family members love the Washlet. It works beautifully. We highly recommend this mnodel !!"
"I love this product. Love it. Love everything about it. Worth every nickel. But what should be an easy install can be onerous if you're not thinking ahead. Forget the install instructions that come with the product; they'll make you want to poke your eyes out (really, who can read and track those instructions???). Instead, go to the YouTube video. Be warned, though, that even that doesn't answer all of your questions. For example, what to do if the holes on your existing toilet are too small for the plastic sinkers that come with your bracing rack? Hmmmmm. But look, it's on, it's working and like anything, you forget the headache for the joy."
"Play Video
 A robot that knows everything your butt needs. From the heated seats to the fact it pre-cleans and then post-cleans your toilet after you go; it’s magic. I’ve been using bidets for years but none this nice."
"Top quality constructions and operation. I love it when using it. Have it for couple months now so familiar with its use, benefits and drawbacks. It offers many settings and frankly I do not use 90% of them. I prefer to go with a less expensive unit but they are bulkier. I have the proximity sensor turned off as it would turn on when just entering the bathroom and has a hum noise which last for some 20 minutes after any use or not. I called Toto on this and they mailed me a plastic tape to cover the sensor to reduce its sensitivity. But it still turns on when you are just a few feet from the unit. Also, I manually turn the unit on and off when using it, to rid this hum when not in use. Overall I am happy with this unit except it is expensive and I do not need most of its features. I wish Toto would offer a basic unit in a slim design."
"I purchased a Toto Washlet in 2007 and it recently began to leak so I shopped for a new one. I love Toto Washlets and I would have given my old one 5 stars, but this one has a confusing and overly complex remote control. In addition the seat feels smaller than the previous one, although both were for the same sized toilet. The people at Toto told me that this was a comparable replacement for the previous one and that I can use the remote control for my previous Washlet with this new one (which I do).

I did give this new one 4 stars though because it has all the features of the old one and it cleans the bowl with ewater (a form of chlorine that helps to sanitize the toilet bowl).

This new one also has a light in the bowl, but I turned that off. Having a lighted bowl might be more useful for males and I (a female) am the only user. My husband has his own Washlet."
"Great design and function. It fits my toilet perfectly (which happens to be an old Toto, although this would fit many other models as well).

Make sure you read the specs very carefully and get the right model as your seat holes and bowl length determine which Toto model you will buy. The design to attach the seat to the toilet is brilliant - VERY secure and locked in the right position.

I did the installation myself and it was pretty easy. I followed the instructions and bought a new water hose ($8) instead of using my old one. Some things need to be tightened firmly, whereas other components should only be hand tightened.

My only knock is that you can program the remote for two different people, but it doesn't appear to remember all of the settings. Perhaps I'm doing it wrong, but it only remembers pressure and position, but not high/low pressure, pulsating or oscillation settings."
"Many people complain (properly) that Toto's pre-cleaning mechanism is too sensitive, starting with the slightest movement anywhere in the bathroom. Mine went on when I came into the bathroom, again when I went into the shower, and again when I got out. It was very annoying.

This issue is solved, as others have noted, by placing a piece of tape over the sensor window. However, the tape can be configured so that the pre-cleaning is completely disabled except when desired. I used a piece of 1"" white, removable poster tape, 1-1/2"" long (available from Amazon) with a 3/32"" hole punched in its center (see picture, I used my leather punch to make a clean hole). The pre-cleaning process is now completely insensitive to any motion in the bathroom, but can be started manually simply by placing one's finger on the hole in the tape. The tape blends perfectly with the Toto and the hole acts just like a button for controlling the pre-cleaning operation."
"BEFORE PURCHASING THIS WASHLET
We have a round toilet bowl in our master bathroom since it is too small to allow installation of the elongated one. As a result only my wife ends up using this toilet (usually with the (non-washlet) toilet seat on) while I use the elongated toilet in the guest bathroom. On the rare occasions I do use the master bathroom toilet, I do not sit on the toilet seat as it restricts the available space for a guy's ...ahem .. you know ... stuff.

AFTER PURCHASING THE WASHLET
After experiencing a TOTO washlet at someone else's place, I went ahead and placed an order for this as a gift to my wife. As I was installing it, I felt that the hole (the space in the middle of the washlet's toilet seat) was too small. I then thought it maybe just me since I never use this round toilet. After a day, my wife comes to me and says ""Hey, I don't want to reject your gift, but the seat is too small"". So, if even a female and a regular user of a round toilet feels this way, I don't know who else would find this size appropriate. To summarize, make sure that the size is not too small for you before you purchase this pricey item.

I wish I could rate individual aspects of an item since my 1-star rating is not really applicable to the main function of the washlet (which I am sure would have been wonderful). But since size is also an important aspect of a product, maybe I shouldn't be too sorry giving it the 1-star rating?"
"I spent time researching for something ""nicer"" to replace my GoBidet attachment. This expensive piece of junk (not to mention the money I spent to have it professionally installed since I needed an electrical outlet) is a tremendous disappointment. It has too many bells and whistles and while you can turn many of them off, the disconcerting fan that blows (deodorizer) is just one of the annoyances. It water pressure is poor and I got much cleaner with my GoBidet than with this thing and at a quarter of the cost. The worst thing though is that flushing the toilet after use can be a problem if you have used the wash for too long as it takes some time for the tank to refill. Anyway, this is a very expensive mistake on my part. I would not recommend it.

Addendum: so I was able to figure out how to turn off the deodorizer and I fixed the flushing problem (I don't think it was the fault of the washlet), but in spite of turning off every automatic feature I could, many times I sit on the seat only to discover that it is wet. I think the wand cleaner is going off on its own and spraying up against the lid and getting the seat wet. I can't figure out how to fix that. Still, a very expensive piece of equipment that I would not recommend."
"Since 2016, I have owned a Toto S300 round bidet. I was happy with it. So recently I added another bidet to my other bathroom. Compared to my older S300 this upgraded model S300E (also round) has significantly weaker water stream pressure. The seat opening is way too small for an adult person. I wish I could still purchase their discontinued S300.
I ended up returning it."
"While they give plenty of measurements, they neglected to mention it won't work if the line coming out of the wall to your toilet is 1/2"", and because they have a special no-leak fitting to the bidet, you can't use a normal tee to split it off. Including this information in the description would have been helpful."
"This is the height of human technology. It is the most amazing thing you will ever buy to make your butt happy and it is worth every penny.

The seat went on relatively easy. The settings are intuitive and clear. The actual function is all kinds of wonderful. It's an absurdly ridiculous price to pay for a toilet seat, yes, but it's not *just* a seat. It is the key to making your life better.

The round seat does cut down on space. If you have a man in the house, go for the elongated model."
Tried these on a recent trip to Japan. My wife thought I was crazy for talking about how great it was and for wanting to get one for the house. Now that we have one and she tried it...she is the one who can't stop talking about it. These are wonderful! Suggest you go with the elongated version. We got the round so it would fit our round toilet. I should have just bought a new bigger toilet and gone with the elongated version for the extra room up front...especially for men.
Excellent quality product well made with detailed instructions on installation and usage. Ever since we vacationed in Hawaii on year where the hotel we stayed at had this in the room we have been wanting to get one at home. This product makes life easier and the quality is absolutely amazing.
"I have only used one washlet before (a lower end, older Toto). That experience was intriguing but not something I felt I could live without. The new 300e, on the other than, stands apart by far with the comfort and features it offers: heated seat, sprays the bowl before use to ensure items don't stick, temperature options for water, dryer, and seat, deodorizer, and wireless remote. It's now a disappointment when I have to go somewhere other than home. No regrets on the purchase even with the steep entry price."
Love the seat. Original had issues with the loud deodorizer fan that couldn't be turned off but it turned out the setting to turn it off was somewhat hidden in the menu system that wasn't clearly noted as the manual is for both the s300 and the s350. now that i can turn off the feature i find this bidet sublime. bought a second one for the other bathroom in the house.
"This device was easily installed and works precisely as advertised. It is pricey however, the unique features for which it was designed make it well worth the value. It is an excellent hygienic convenience that, as a physician, I strongly recommend its use. Be careful in ordering, it comes in a round front and a tapered front version. I ordered the wrong version, but Need Plumbing Supplies was phenomenally cooperative in allowing me to return and reorder without any penalty."
"The best! Why did I wait so long before getting one. It superb in cleaning butt after bowel movement. Bidet works great too. Can customize where sprays, how hard sprays, and water temperature. The heated seat is a luxury everyone deserves. It also keeps the bowl clean.

There are a number of different models at different price points"
"Everyone should own one. This is my third. Two older models are still functioning well after 10 years in other baths. Not a single complaint, or caution. Easy installation. Well constructed. You get what you pay for. Wireless, wall mounted control is a big plus over competitiors with integrated controls."
"Works well, installation instructions easy to follow. One word of caution, water line connector made of soft plastic, easily cross threaded, fortunate, handy husband could remedy the problem with sharp Swiss Army knife."
Nice feature when it lights up the bowl when you stand up so you can see the mess you’ve made.
"I HAVE HAD TOTO TOILET SEATS FOR MANY YEARS. lOVED THEM. HOWEVER, THINGS HAVE CHANGED.
THIS UPPER END UNIT'S HOLE IS SO SMALL AN AVERAGE SIZE MAN HAS TO STUFF HIS JUNK IN.
ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF CHANGING SOMETHING AND MAKING IT WORSE. I READ THIS ON OTHER REVIEWS, BUT DID NOT BELIEVE TOTO COULD BE SO INCOMPETENT. IT IS PAST MY 30 DAYS AND I STILL CANNOT GET USED TO THIS SMALLER HOLE AND THAT I LOST OVER A THOUSAND DOLLARS. SHAME ON TOTO !!! MY FATHER USED TO SAY, DON'T FIX IT IF IT IS NOT BROKEN."
"bought 2 of them, one of them had scratches on its lid,
i could not return as the plumber was in next day and he charges 60 dollars an hour
and call out fees.
anyway works well , but scratches can be seen when top lid is closed."
"Hard to beat a warm seat and oh so clean. Unless you need an automatic seat, this is the one to get."
"Item as described and worked well. However measurement of seat hole size was unpublished on both sellers website and the Toto website (seat hole is smaller than normal). This item is really made for small men - medium/small women because washing jets will not reach back far enough for normal men. Contacted Toto to see if could purchase shorter wand or retrofit to reach back farther, but no help. Expensive lesson in ordering online because once installed, item not returnable."
"Had to return as the seat is very short because of the hardware housing Not comfortable, very disappointed."
Easy to set up and use. Works great
Amazing product. Easy to install. Works better than expected
Fantastic (a bit noisy) but fabulous!
We bought this product two years ago but did not install it till one year later. But after six months use it started making a fan sound that was so loud it was very uncomfortable to use it. It was fine when we first started using it but what a bad quickly. My wife finally asked me to uninstall it as it simply too noisy.
"Like it more all the time! Everyone needs one for your well being. Works as advertised, is very effecient. If you can choke down the price, put one in your house."
A wonderful addition to my bathroom. Talk about feeling pampered . . . Problem is that now I don't want to use any bathroom that does not have a washlet - ever!
This is the greatest invention since sliced bread. Love it. Sitting on a warm seat on a cold day is the greatest! And the bidet function works perfectly.
A Nice product..
What an amazing product! It has worked flawlessly and I love the warm seat.
"wrong size

reordered a long one."
"I bought the wrong one and had to put it into the second bathroom. Soon as I save more money, I'll get one for my bathroom. I love it!"
This is a great tool for your comfort!
Love it. A cinch to install. Works great.
Highly recommended to buy it! I love it!
I love this toilet seat. It does everything it promices. The dryer is too hot but otherwise perfect!
I love it.
This thing leaks and the instructions are not accurate. Total water off money flushed down the toilet.
works great
Great improvement on earlier models. Best seat in the house.
Very pleased
good product at a good price
"The Amazon and Toto are denied the misleading answers about where is the seat made in? 8 months of use , it has a washer problem causing the water level goes low and Toto asks for the seal no. The label as the picture shows it is made in Malaysia.
I am lied when I use Amazon the search machine to looking for the product I want. Toto staff says some parts are made in Japan, but assembling the plate in Malaysia."
"I have been using this Washlet now for three months. (S350e). My contractor talked us into not installing the extra extender pipe because it would be so visible. It does have a water tube and electrical plug coming from it, so if you wanted a total clean look think about placement. It warns you about washing your front too often or much, due to drying you out. It does spray that ewater. I like the features, self cleaning and deodorizing. The sit threw me off at first. It felt so plastic compared to my old seat. Getting used to it, but feels so cheap, of course when it will be he most expensive seat you will ever buy. Again the features are too great too let sit keep you from the investment."
"First off let me say this unit is fantastic, I however an not convinced that the unit was sold as brand new. When it arrived it looked scuffed up and just not right somehow.
I have only had it in operation for a week and the remote control has had to be repaired twice, The button for oscillating stopped working two times and cost me 40 dollars each time to have it repaired. Also this unit is not supposed to have a toilet light. Toto's website states that s350 model does but not the s300 and mine which is a s300 has a toilet light ?????? strange!
I am not sure if this unit has been refurbished or if it is a knock off. I am not too sure if that is the reason the price was much cheaper than the toto website."
About people who complain it's noisy: it's the anti-odour fan. You can disable it with the remote. It's explained in the manual. I also disabled the blue light.
Personnel bon produit
"If I could give 4.75 stars, I would, since there is room for minor improvement in the programmable functions provided - particularly considering this seat is twice the price of the S200.

However, as it stands - or sits, I guess - this seat is fabulous, and everyone who uses it loves it.

I also paid for the expert installation.
Not because I was incapable of installing the seat - it is in fact very easy to install.
I bought the installation to ensure the seat got installed the same week it was delivered - rather than sit around for some months until I got around to it.
And of course, the installer took literally half the time I would have taken to complete the installation.
So the seat was delivered on Wednesday, the installer came on Friday, and we spent the weekend luxuriating in our new-found comfort.

So, about the seat itself:
First of all: cleanliness!
The main reason I bought this seat is to get a cleaner personal result - and this seat does the perfect job at that.
We are also using significantly less toilet paper, as expected - but you will still want to use small amounts of paper to help the clean function and/or help the dry function.
And you want that paper to be thick so it doesn't disintegrate when it gets wet.

In addition to personal cleanliness, the toilet keeps itself cleaner too.
My wife loves that the toilet now disinfects itself on a regular basis - and I love the look it has when it lights itself up with the LED.

As other reviewers have pointed out, the odor remover works impressively well - a real bonus, particularly when guests visit and the toilet gets more use than usual.

The comfort features are highly appreciated by everyone who uses the seat - the warmed seat (we have it turned down to warm rather than hot); the warmed water (ditto); the dry feature - and for the ladies, the ""personal moment"" settings...

However, there are some minor issues where Toto could do better - particularly on a top-of-the-line model.

* We have the automatic lid-open function disabled, because it alarmed my wife when she entered the bathroom at night.
Sadly, if you disable the auto-open function, then the auto-close function is also disabled - which is disappointing.
It would be so nice if the toilet just closed the lid automatically if ever someone forgets.
And it would be trivial to provide independent controls for these functions.

* Similarly, some reviewers have complained that the sound of the auto-clean at night disturbs them - and once again you cannot disable the auto-clean at night, without turning off the entire seat at night.
The seat already has a programmable timer for eco-mode - so a separate timer for the auto-clean would again be trivial.

A few reviewers also complained about the noise on older models, of the fan that runs for some 30 minutes after use.
Happily, Toto has fixed this on the later models (I bought mine in early 2017).
After the cleaning function - which is already whisper-quiet - the toilet is essentially silent.
Out of curiosity, I did listen for the fan noise, and discovered that if I put my head right next to the seat, I could just hear the faintest of a fan hum.
But since this is truly not a position one would put one's head immediately after using the toilet, I class the toilet as silent.

The light and motorised lid functions are really nice to have - but truly, not essential.

I was worried about the power consumption of this model. Because it heats the water on the spot, it draws ~850W which is roughly half of the total power of a regular outlet, and we have other - lower power - appliances plugged in to the outlet near the toilet.
Happily, there is enough power for everything, so I've not had to route an extension cord in from somewhere, or have the bathroom rewired.

So is the more expensive model worth almost double the price of the S200?
In many ways probably not.

The reason I bought the S350 is that it is much slimmer in design than the S200 - because the S200 has a fairly bulky holding tank, and the S350 does not - and therefore my wife would not be offended by new seat's looks.
In fact, the exact opposite is true with the S350. Not only does my wife love the sleek look of our new seat, but she loves showing it off to visitors, and of course loves using it herself.

In her words, when we visited friends a week after our wonder-seat had been installed ""I miss our toilet seat..."""
"Ever since I lived in Japan, I wanted one of these back home in USA. Let me tell you, you'll never want to use a different toilet setup again!

It took 20 minutes to install and properly fit, including the water line adapter; too easy! The remote is simple to use and the memory is easy to set, supporting recall of water pressure and position settings for 2 people.

The bowl light and side light are great. I can leave the lights completely off and when I walk in they turn on so it's not dark. Let me provide disambiguation here though that this is NOT a nightlight that some models have, these lights only turn on when the toilet is being used or you proximity-trigger the IR beam.

The autoclean feature works great and I've only had to clean the bowl once every month or so. The customizable heated seat works perfectly. I love the toggleable seat lift feature too.

When using the water spray feature, there is a shutoff timer built in which takes effect after a minute or so, presumably to preserve the life of the pump motor.

With this model's tankless water heater, you don't run out of heated water. The temperature is very consistent and doesn't vary.

After buying this, my father bought a similar Toto for my mother in their house. Then my father even bought one, and he's super old-school American so I was shocked. Then my grandmother got one. Seems everyone loves theirs!

I paired this with a Squatty Potty and will NEVER look back (watch the YouTube advertisement commercial for it if you don't know about them).

With the bidet function, you get most the gunk off you after #2, but not quite everything in my experience. Still it's way better than using toilet paper especially if you suffer from hemorrhoids

I've used maybe 10 rolls of toilet paper in the last year, and now only use a single sheet of adult washcloths to touch things up. Take that, COVID-19 toilet paper hoarders!

CONS:
There aren't any, just these suggestions:

If you use the autoclean feature (highly recommended), close the bathroom door at night if you're a light sleeper as it may disturb you. It's not loud, but distinctive enough to jolt me awake thinking someone was in my house :)

Be sure to properly set the lid autoopen/close timer's interval to something that works for you. If the IR sensor detects you walking by it on your way to another room, either disable it or properly configure it!

You can configure the toilet to automatically raise either the lid or both the lid and the seat. For the ladies in the house this is particularly important if you want to raise just the lid without touching it yourself- just use the remote button!

Properly prep the toilet tank cover for adhesion of the anti-noise nub intended for the lid to make contact with. Yes it makes noise because it's a plastic toilet lid, but my toilet lid was dusty so my nub fell off and I had to get another at Home Depot."
"The main feature of this seat, the wash function, is a great alternative to toilet paper. You won't want to go back. It's worth buying for this alone.

Operating the basic functions of the seat while you're actively using it is pretty straightforward. Once you get into the more advanced settings, it can be a little confusing to understand how all of the settings work and interact with each other. But that's what the manual is for. For instance, there are two different types of energy saver modes, and you can use neither one, either one, or both at once. They will all cause the seat to work a little differently. It does seem a little wasteful that the heated seat stays on at all times (unless you turn it completely off). But, I admit that a heated seat on a toilet wouldn't have much of a point if it wasn't already warm when you sit down. The energy saver modes are meant to turn the heat down or turn it off when the seat thinks you are least likely to use it.

The automatic power seat is probably overkill, and it seems to overreact a little bit, especially if you have a small bathroom. I can hardly go into my bathroom to use the sink without triggering the toilet to open. Just the steam from taking a shower seems to also trigger the seat to open at times. Of course, you can shut off the automatic seat, but at that point it's probably best to just buy the s300e that doesn't have this feature. I only really got the s350 because of the fact that Amazon has it cheaper than most other places charge for the s300.

These are all minor issues though. Overall, like I said, the seat works great.

Lastly, I had a hard time finding solid information regarding exactly how long the power cord is on this. Some places seemed to say three feet, some said almost four. My power cord measures about 50 inches (4ft 2in) from the end of the plug to where it goes into the left side of the seat. Luckily that is long enough for where my outlet is located, but it probably would not have been long enough if it was only 3 feet, so I wanted to pass this info along for anyone else trying to figure out if it will work in their bathroom. The owner's manual does state that it's acceptable to use a grounded extension cord if necessary."
"I bought the Tota SW583 mainly for the bidet feature, to eliminate use of paper on a rather delicate part of my anatomy. With water temperature, pressure, wand position, wand motion while cleaning, and dryer air temperature all controlled by a remove, it more than serves that purpose. Other features include a heated seat, an ""eWater+"" self-cleaning feature, a vacuum that filters the air in the bowl, and even an infrared sensor that detects your approach, so you never need to touch the seat with your hands. Installation is ""almost"" easy: my only caution is if - like me - your toilet has a polypropylene fill valve connector, I recommend replacing the steel nut on the tee connector furnished by Toto with a polypropylene nut (replacement requires an 8 mm hex key, and the knowledge that the internal fitting turns the ""wrong"" way) to avoid stripping the threads on your fill valve. Overall a full-featured and well-made product, and a valuable addition to a bathroom."
"I've installed and tested (after Chipotle burrito) and this is the best thing ever. I discovered Toto toilet ""systems"" after a trip to South Korea where things like this are installed everywhere. At first, I was scared to press the blinking buttons on the hotel toilet, but after clenching up and pressing, I discovered a whole new order of clean. So for the past several years, I've been hankering after one of these. With a new house and some money left from the old one, I decided to indulge myself. And it is an indulgence: warm water oscillating, pulsing and cleaning, warm air drying off afterwards and a integrated seat fan and filter make this a great experience. It even rinses the bowl after the flush has finished, just to clear anything that was left.

Installation was not terribly difficult aside from the electrical. I cheated and ran an extension cord until I can get around to installing another outlet. Everything else was very easy if you have even as small amount of skill with a screwdriver and a pair of pliers.

My only complaint is that I could not fit the ""oval"" elongated seat on my toilet. The bathroom doesn't have enough space fore to aft and I had to use the ""round"" shape. It feels a little short for my tall frame. But I can't fault the Toto seat for an architectural issue with the house."
"Very bummed. We got it installed and the features seemed amazing. But we quickly noticed the thing was constantly running. I started playing with features. Basically I turned cleaning features off and anything I could to get it to quiet down. The auto open shut (which was what I wanted the most didn't work right either. I set to 25 seconds, because my hope was for it to shut before we flush, but it never would shut. So I shut that feature off too. Pretty soon I had this thing set to a basic bidet just to have it be quiet and not open Everytime I was just standing at vanity. Last night I got home from a week trip, and the remote is just not working. Like totally black. T was sold for 900 instead of the standard 1200, do not sure if it was a second/refurbished/outlet or something. So lesson learned not going to look for the best price anymore. Going to go to Toto and ask more questions and see if I can see how it is actually supposed to work. Putting my cheaper basic one back on and gonna do more research."
"Shamefully expensive, it really is. Way too embarrassing to tell anyone how much you paid for it, so be ready to dodge those questions. But the wow factor you get and the convenience and the fun, all totally worth it. Instantly makes your bathroom the coolest room to hang, forget your TV, this is what people will come to look at. This is one electronic apparatus that actually WILL wipe your ass. Probably the coolest thing about it is the one thing that's unique to this particular one - the automatic opener and closer, that is the introduction factor that instantly WOWs, though also creeps most people out and scares others. The remote is very slick and has LCD screen on the back for controlling temperatures of the water, seat, and dryer. Once you use its seat warmer, other toilet seats will seem very primitive. Wash your back, your front, have some naughty fun.

Update: Well, the coolest thing about, the automatic opener, broke, now it opens half way, gets stuck, tries really hard, gives up, and slams back down really hard. Supposedly this is because the seat was being held back too many times when it tried to open and so the motor got ruined. Well, if you have cats, beware, my cat loved this bidet, and so would often be on top of it when it tried to open. But for this much money Toto should've made some safety precaution features to avoid this issue, or at the very least stand behind their premium product, but the warranty on this is only 1 year, this is totally unacceptable for a product that's close to a thousand dollars.

Another really annoying thing is that the button under the seat that gets pressed when you sit on it that determines if somebody is currently using it is only on the right side. This might be TMI but I find it easier to lean left when I wipe which disengages that button, the result is that the toilet bowl cleaning water starts spraying you and the lid closes on you while you're still sitting, awkward. All they would've had to do is to simply put the button on both sides to fix this. On occasion it also closes while you're standing up peeing, at which point you have a big decision to make. Its person detection mechanisms are not very good at all. Also, the top button on the remote for the seat/lid doesn't work every time you press it, and a replacement remote is over a 100 bucks."
"I told my wife these are a gimic. Nobody use these things. WAS I WRONG!
These work great and will make toilet paper obsolete. It washes you; it dries you; it cleans the toilet bowl; it cleans itself; it has theater lighting and auto raises & lowers the lid. And it also sanitizes the air in the bowl! If it talked, it would be perfect."
"Bought recently this s350e (SW583) and the first one went sideways - when I tried the washing function it just opened a hatch, but did not showed a stick. After that all the water functionality becomes disabled, washing buttons doesn't even beep when pressed, no usual poweroff for 30 sec helped. I called support and they were able to help with debugging - the failure actually recorded by mcu and stays there.

This fail state could be reset by: holding power until leds will start to blink, then simultaneously holding Front button and if orange seat led blinks (which means water system failure) you can hold third button Down (all 3 buttons pressed) until beep. Then you need to disconnect power for 5 sec and when you will power it back - water functions will work again. This most probably will not fix the wash issue, but at least will help to identify the problem.

I've returned my first failed one and reordered similar one, which worked perfectly since installation! Even with this initial failure I'm not disappointed and with help of TOTO support & amazon delivery & returns was able to quickly fix the issue."
"LIke I said, I love it except for the remote. Even most of the remote is OK. But for all the quality they put into everything else, they put a flimsy button on the end of the remote for raising and lowering the seat. If only women are using the seat, that may not be a big deal. But it is a PITA if the seat is being used by a man. The button must be pushed squarely to work. It's not unusual to have to push it several times to get it to work. The button won't work if you happen to hit one of the buttons on the side of the remote at the same time - something which is easy to do. And the button isn't held on securely and pops off from time to time. Because of it falling off, I've lost a button, which is even more of a PITA. In that case, you need to put something like a pen near the remote to be able to push the button. That's where I""m at right now. I've not tried to get a replacement yet, but have noticed that the entire remote goes for something like $140. I""m gonna be really mad if I need a whole remote just because of their flimsy button design. My guess is their testing was done only with women or they would have noticed this weak point.

Edited to add: I called Toto and they were very helpful and are going to replace the remote. It's great to know they stand behind their products.

Oh, btw, one suggestion - definitely get the elongated seat, even if it means replacing your toilet. The round seat is kind of small and forces you forward a few inches, which means that waste doesn't drop in the deep part of the toilet, it hits the shallows and slides down, making it often necessary to flush multiple times or even do some nasty cleaning of the toilet on an almost daily basis. I'm guessing this is mostly avoided with the elongated seat, but don't know for sure. I've got two of the round seats."
"I absolutely love this seat, I hope it lasts forever, I have my doubts how long the auto open and close will last, you can’t go near the bathroom without it opening, and company always wants to open and close lids by hand and not use remote so forcing motors.
The only issue I have all the mechanisms take up room at the back of your toilet opening so when sitting on the toilet you feel crowded forward, not great for a guy. I wish I would’ve put in a larger oval toilet first, but besides that it is awesome, always warm seat and continuous hot water, adjustable spray patterns and location."
"Play Video
 Pros:
1) Easy and quick installation. I threw a single layer of teflon around all connections to be safe although it didn't seem necessary.
2) Water pressure is pretty good. Make sure you've set your remote to full spray (solid light), not soft spray (blinking light), and that your water cut-off valve is open all the way. As a point of reference that's with an incoming water pressure of ~45 PSI which isn't particularly great.
3) Warm toilet seat
4) Pre-mist seems to help keep the bowl cleaner
5) The fan seems to do a pretty good job of killing odors

Cons:
1) The round version of the toilet is on the smaller side due to space lost for the retractable wand & spray components. While I don't see this being an issue for women, it does require some getting used to (and adjusting) for men as you sit down.
2) No way to temporarily disable auto functionality for a period of time. If I'm giving my kid a bath I need to use the remote to disable these features and then re-enable them afterwards, otherwise the seat will continually open/close + pre-mist. Would be great if I could pause or disable ""auto features"" for 30 minutes.
3) While the mount/base that connects to the toilet is on very snug, the actual unit has more give than I'd prefer once snapped in place. This means after a few uses the unit itself finds itself a quarter inch to the left or the right versus dead center. Seemingly small issue right now but I wonder how much trouble this play in the seat will cause after long term usage
4) At nearly 4.5x the cost of the toilet that this seat sits on, the price is a serious hurdle.
5) Fan is a bit on the louder side during use, although the benefits may outweigh the negative here
6) There's a bit of a steady hum that never seems to fully turn off or go away. It's pretty low though fades into the background after a few days.

Wildcard:
1) If you've got a toddler who is learning to potty train the concept of a robotic toilet that automatically opens when you approach and spits water into the bowl will either be hilarious and very enjoyable or terrifying and potentially scarring."
"Well, what is there to say. You are either the kind of person to buy a $1000 bidet or you aren't. If you do, and manage to get the damn thing installed despite Todo's best efforts to thwart you, you will have a delightful bidet with seat warming, very comfortable adjustable spray, and a delightful way to frighten your dogs. This thing detects you approaching it and lifts its lid, sprays the toilet bowl as a pre-cleaner and makes a hissing sound. Even my a$-hole husky gets startled. If you slightly resent your dog, as most husky owners do, its great entertainment.
In short, excellent bidet and we really enjoy it.
However, the install instructions are freaking garbage. The online video from Todo doesn't help much but it IS hilarious. Do yourself a favor and hire a plumber or make a pact with whatever dark gods Toto are using to write their installation instructions."
"I bought this washlet after researching many models. I had used one in Japan and
wanted something for my own home. After using it for a month, I can provide some
useful feedback.

Shipping: the seat was shipped in a flat cardboard box. It was well-packaged
and arrived in the promised time.

Installation instructions: I purchased the washlet designed for a round toilet.
The installation instructions are correct, but they could be improved. In particular,
there is a problem with installing the screws in the holes in the ceramic toilet seat.
The toilet holes are not of a uniform shape or size and the screws do not always fit if
one attempts to insert them from the top. The screws have a rubber gasket that allows
a tight fit. The solution is to insert the ""head"" of the screw from below the toilet. This
requires squeezing the rubber gasket.

It is extremely important to have a proper electrical outlet near the back of the toilet.
Do not purchase the washlet without doing the electrical work first. The plumbing
is trivial, but it is extremely important to only hand-tighten the nuts.

Operation: Once plugged in, the washlet is very easy to use. The back of the remote
control needs to be used to set the temperature. This setting occasionally changes
by itself. I do not understand why.

It is important to keep some wipes nearby to wipe off the seat. Some water could spray on the bottom
of the seat.

One drawback is that the opening in the seat is not as large as desirable. Depending on how one
sits it may be necessary to adjust the position of the nozzle.

The only reason I did not rate this product to be the 5 star is the size of the opening of the seat."
"I anticipated being able to quickly install my new Toto Washlet and was surprised to need to contact customer service to help me do so. Customer service was a huge help and ultimately helped figure out that a small piece had fallen into the box which prompted my seat to not click into place. The Washlet for my round toilet was way more expensive than for an elongated toilet. The EWATER has proven to be helpful in keeping the bowl clean, but not sure why the cost is so different! My only other negative comment is that the dryer really doesn't do much of anything so there is still a need for toilet paper. I still love my washlet, but just some observations."
"Auto lid is too sensitive so it opens whenever I goes to bathroom, but still love this function."
"It's great. I wanted to get one of these for years after visiting Japan but needed to get power close enough in my bathroom to use it. I finally got that project done so I pulled the trigger and bought this. It really is a game changer for cleanliness. I didn't expect to like the automatic seat as much as I do, but I love just walking in and pressing a button on the top of the controls and then not worrying about putting the seat down afterwards.

I will say that I bought the round version to match my existing toilet, and with the mechanism on this toilet seat you lose some space, so it was noticeable to me that I feel more cramped while sitting (hence the 4 stars). I didn't even think of this before, but if I had it to do over I would buy a new elongated toilet and get the elongated seat."
I think you have to have a Toto toilet to get a finished look. I purchased the elongated version for my elongated American Standard toilet and hate the way it looks. I had it installed and had to send off for extra parts because of the connector (I have a skirted toilet). A pain when you’ve hired someone to install and they have to come back. I suppose I will ultimately need to buy a Toto toilet as I can’t stand the current look. See pictures. The remote to operate it is also very large which makes it look old fashioned.
"I fell in love with these automatic toilets while in Japan and had been longing for these high tech toilets ever since. It's been 4 years since I had this washout installed on both toilets in our home and have no regrets whatsoever. The automatic lid opening whenever one goes into the bathroom is a bit of a nuisance as others mentioned. It is not an issue in Japan because toilets are usually in a separate room from a bathtub or showers. I don't notice a large increase on our electric bills which is another plus. BTW, My plumber tucked away the water tube on one, but not the other, so I just tied it with a zip tie so the water tube would not just hang there."
"Never had a washlet before, first one. I couldn't be happier. Went ahead and went with the reviews from everywhere. Toto is the best. Quality is great. Features are great. This will eventually save you a ton of money in toilet paper. It really does a great job cleaning you and helps keep the toilet clean. The air cleaner really does work. Rarely is there any smell when someone uses it afterward. For the remote to work properly, you have to make sure the sensor toward the back is not covered up or obstructed in any way. Figured they'd use bluetooth, but they are using IR, I believe. Only complaint I could even find. I've converted a few of my friends over to Toto and they all love it!"
Best thing I have ever purchased . I don’t know I lived without it.
"I was able to install this unit myself with very little fanfare and have been using it for one month. I was very impressed how much functionality they got into such a small form factor. It works as advertised. I like the fact that it does not have a water tank, but rather warms the water in real time so it never runs out of warm water. As with other reviewers, I find that the ""round"" version is a pretty tight fit, but I have gotten used to it. However, if you do have a choice between outfitting a round-bowl toilet versus an oval-bowl toilet with this product, I recommend going with your oval-bowl toilet because you will get more room for your fanny."
"The seat works well, but like many others experienced the T connector leaks. Took me several days of experimenting with different washers to stop it from leaking. What worked for me in the end, is a single rubber cone washer without any other flat washers. This has been a known problem for years, Toto should have fixed it, especially for such an expensive product."
"Not going into a lot of detail here. I just want to say that we love this washlet. We bought it 2 years ago and are still very pleased. If it breaks in the future, I will be buying another one immediately. Features include warm seat, automatic lid raising when you approach, automatic lid lowering after you leave, spray cleans bowl before and after each use, lots of options for spray features, a blow dryer (haha!), cool blue light comes on when lid goes up(good for night time). We really miss it when we travel. I can't believe that we got this for under $1,000. It seems expensive but once we used it, we were sold!"
"My $1000 bidet stopped working properly a little after a year of owning it. The unit would not respond to any of the buttons being pushed (no water or air dryer). After watching some YouTube videos, it was suggested to unplug & replug, which is what I did for several months until it got to the point where I'd have to reset the thing before each use. Naturally, this was very annoying. I finally called Toto to see if they had any suggestions and they say I could send the unit in for repairs for $200. I'd expect more out of $1K unit. You're better off with the $300 version at Costco. The only draw back is no continuous hot water but at least if it breaks after a year, you'll have a better refund option."
"I thought it works better than my other bidet based on the price close to a MacBook. First the T connector is metal, so it broke the fill valve in the tank. I hired two plumbers for installation just wanna make sure there was no leak. I use the T connector I kept from my other bidets. Then I found I probably need to install a camera to tell me when the “work” is done because the “accident” happened much more frequently with this gadget. I sit there long time just wanna make sure the spray worked…. Well, I just came out of shower because I found something on the toilet paper again after properly washed by toto."
I love this and will eventually purchase one for every bathroom. This is worth the money.
I love my Toto toliet seat! Best purchase of 2020. However have found my cats love it more then me. They have figured out how to trigger opening the seat and love watching the self cleaning mode. Any tips on how to make the seat lifting mode be less sensitive would be greatly appreciated. If your on the fence about getting this don’t wait. I waited to long to get mine!
"Sometimes you just don't fully appreciate what you have until you are away from home. That's right. I had this installed over the winter months and really enjoyed the warmth and comfort of this seat. Just having to go away for business trips make me realize just how much I enjoy this seat. Yes. I said it. Enjoy. The seat is more comfortable than regular seats, the warmer makes it even more inviting, and the wash and dry... Once you go paperless, it is difficult to go back.

Installation is easy. Setup is easy. Once you get the presets configured, everything is just so straightforward and easy.

One thing I would like changed is the auto lights. I wish the lights stayed on longer at night. Not a big deal, but would be nice to be able to configure that."
"We've had this product since late May 2014, and it has really been amazing. It is easy to install (per my husband - I have no mechanical ability) and works as advertised right out of the box. The remote control is easy to use and very intuitive. We have never had a problem with it. We did have to disable the auto close/open (very easy to do), because it totally freaked our cats out when they walked past it. I actually laughed till I cried the first time it happened - the cat exploded right in front of me! But in deference to kitty blood pressure and heart palpitations, we disabled that feature. Another unheralded but significant advantage of the Toto, for those of us of a certain age, is colonoscopy prep.

'Nuff said."
"As someone who suffers from ulcerative colitis this seat is worth every penny. The comfort it provides when your making 10 or more trips to the bathroom a day is amazing. Just the thought of not being so sore after bathroom trips even helps emotionally when your having a rough flare up.

Installation was very easy and I was lucky to have an outlet already close enough.

I only wish I had the elongated toilet instead of the rounded because as a larger person it does feel as if it pushes you to the front of the seat."
"This washlet is simply the best! It has every feature one could possibly want in a refined, sleek unit. Being one of the most advanced designs available, this washlet does away with the bulk and medical look of other, less expensive models. With built in body sensors, air and bowl cleaning modes as well as heated seat and rear drier,automatic lid and seat open/close, as well as a night light, there isn't a feature that has been left out. Not to mention its modern remote with easy management of all functions, this is a model you don't want to pass up if you must have the best! Self installation was a breeze- Highly recommended to anyone looking for the best washlet around."
"I bought the Toto s350 washlet on Amazon while I was waiting to board my flight back from Japan. We had an awesome trip and were lamenting how we were going to live without the Japanese toilets. It was delivered a few days after we got back and we couldn't be happier. Now I can't imagine life without it, it's the best invention ever. It's just so damn civilised! It was easy to install and now we have an English language version I can fully appreciate all the features that were a bit of a mystery on some of the versions in Japan. It's expensive for sure but once you've experience it you'll never go back."
"I love this. I don't know why I waited so long to buy it. Really well designed. I love the ability to vary the pressure of the water and the aim of the water. The warm toilet seat is also a joy. It was easy to install once I found the YouTube video. The instruction in the box have little value. You do have to have a GFI outlet within about 3 feet of the seat. I am tempted to get another for the guest bath, but don't want to freak out my guests!"
"Great unit. Exceeded our expectations. My wife and I went to Japan last fall and discovered their amazing washlet toilets. I got this unit for my wife for Christmas. The only caveat I would say is that in hind site, I probably should have purchased the 300 vs the 350. The only difference is the automatic lid. In our master bath the toilet is not in a separate room. With the 350 the lid would open every time we stood at the counter until I disabled the lid. I will turn that function back on should we install the Washlet into a bathroom with a desperate WC."
I like the look and characteristics of the seat. Everything works as well-or better- than expected. I would recommend it to anyone wanting to feel clean and comfortable.
"I first tried a washlet in Japan, a country that knows personal cleanliness. They have them everywhere including the toilets in the train stations. I had to have one and it doesn’t disappoint. In addition to cleaning you, it cleans itself. Awwww..."
"Yes its expensive, but what a great product. I have used it for about two weeks and love it. I had to go online for instructions because none were shipped. There are also some great videos on line showing detailed instructions. One point to make on a round toilet, the seat is small and took a little to get used to. Would I recommend one to a friend yes I would."
"Not sure if it’s defective or not but we use the bidet feature water always sprays out between the seat and the bowl -but only on the left side. So it seems to work but we have to remember to remove clothing off of our left leg when using the seat to prevent water stains on our clothes and then we have to wipe the back of our left leg and ankle with toilet paper to dry when finished. Sure wish Toto had customer service assistance to help us figure this out. We would have returned ours as defective but we are busy and missed the return window.

UPDATE. Contacted TOTO and sent our unit in for warranty repair. Turnaround was about 2 weeks. So far it works great. Very happy!"
We bought this during covid pendemic. Best in class. And help save the planet with less toilet paper. Difficult to install the rubber in the hole of the toilet. Needs a lot of strength. They should do a better job for that part and offer better alternative.
As most other reviewers fell in love with these in Japan on travel. Americans need to wake and take advantage of this smart approach. Seat works excellent provides cleanliness for my wife and I and installs in 15 minutes. I can't live without these anymore and wish my work had them in the bathrooms. I have hemorrhoids and soft feces; this device makes it so easy to live with those conditions. TOTO is the most seen brand i've observed in Japan hotels.
"As others say, this is the ideal product for cleanliness! My husband installed it in about 30 minutes. It is less different in looks than the less expensive Toto 100 seat we have in our other bathroom. I don't have a problem with the seat being 'too small', though my husband initially commented that it felt smaller than the plain seat we had before this. But after a few days, he seems very comfortable using the seat."
"The product is great. Unfortunately, the one we ordered was refurbished. It works perfectly...but it was dirty!!! I thought ""refurbished"" would naturally mean a used unit that was in good working order - I expected them to at least CLEAN IT!
It's not like I haven't cleaned a toilet before, but I didn't expect to have to do it to one right out of the box.
Once we got the previous owner's poop removed, it was fine."
"The Toto Washlet seat installed easily. The only consideration is that a power outlet is required behind the toilet. I knew this going in and it was not an issue. I am 6'4"" 210 pounds and the seat feels a trifle small, but I had tried it in advance and chose to buy."
"We did our research and decided to purchase Toto, as it's the top of the line. Unfortunately the unit we received was defective. Tried calling Toto support on a Saturday but they were closed on weekends. Evaluating other reviews, I got the gist that Toto can take a few days to respond to questions after contacting their tech support so we decided to return and get a refund. We also purchased a $37 non-electrical option (Brondell's water-driven bidet that normally is about $50 on Amazon)--we are quiet happy with the no-frill solution. We also noted that Toto used a plastic T-connector vs. a more solid metal T-connector shipped with the $25. I expect this is an amazing product if not-defective and doesn't malfunction/break after the warranty expires."
"Works just as expected. Good instruction manual but cryptic install guide (youtube was a help).
The water T connect has slight dripping; that appears to be known issue. I was able to fix it by
wrapping in stretchy silicone tape."
"Wanted one for a long time, so when we remodel the upstairs bathroom we added this to the bathroom. So far we are very with it."
"It’s pricey, but I’m addicted."
"Who knew hands free hygiene could be so pleasant?
Night light.
Automatically opens.
Warm seat.
Cleanses pleasantly.
Dries pleasantly.
Self-cleaning.
We're saving so much money with the plummeting expenditures on TP."
Seems like it couldn't survive the volume during quarantine time?! :-D
"Recommend everyone with IBS or similar to buy now! This improves my life. I tell everyone to buy!!!!
Edit: I've owned it for over a year and a half now. This is the best thing since sliced bread. Especially in the winter. I moved and it was so easy to install in my new apartment. Do yourself a favor and buy one!"
Bought it five year ago. Main problem is noisy 😃
"Not much more to say that has not been said by hundreds before. A very meaningful improvement in the quality of the bathroom experience. Very easy to set up (likely will need a small piece that does not come with it), and then nirvana of warm seats, warm water and warm air"
Excellent! Does it’s job! You’ve got to try it out to believe it! How did I ever get along without a Toto washlet bidet before?
Pure luxury. It's getting a lot of use. Worth every penny.
"I don't know anyone who uses a bidet, only me so I have no other experience to go off of but here is how it works for me. It leaves me all wet, dripping from my balls. Blow dryer function is useless unless I sit there for 30 minutes waiting for my balls and balloon knot to get air dried.

TL:DR - Threw it away."
"If you want the best washlet, this has to be it. Tons of options, remote that looks like it could be from a high end audio system, and installation that took all of 15 mins."
"I like it pretty much. But after 13 months, lid doesn't close by itself. It opens fine, but just doesn't close most of the time. Seems like it's trying to close by making some beep, but it doesn't. Disappointed."
This is a great product. Trying to purchase another but seems to be a supplier problem.
Nice product
"We happened to have this model in a hotel that we spent a week in. Not at all as good as other Toto models, like the C2 which I love. Just didn't clean well, and sprayed everywhere."
"I purchased this for a bathroom renovation, and we just installed it this week. It is defective and doesn't work properly. The wand that acts at the bidet won't activate to spray, then sprays randomly onto the floor when nobody is on the seat. The seat hole is not large enough for large people. It is flimsily constructed, and the remote control does not respond to commands. We plan to return it for a refund."
"Great product. It may be noisy as it quickly heats up the water, but overall, a worthwhile purchase"
"Helped a disabled person out with personal hygiene
Great product"
After traveling to Japan I ordered this for my master bathroom. Now I can't imagine my life without it.
The best way to keep clean.
Un...real. am I ever wiping my own butt again? Doubt it. Highly doubt it! This thing is world class. Paid for itself in a month!
Love the seat but really hate that the heater and the dryer stoped working in just over two years. It has a three year warranty so we will begin the process of seeing if they will replace it or what but such an expensive item should have features of it that just stop working so soon.
"They've thought of everything, and I feel like I have an in home Japanese Spa feature!"
Great I like it and recommend it
Perfect
"My toilet seat arrived with a missing part. The t-connector was not included in the package, so I wasted time and money with my electrician appointment. Please contact me to resolve this issue."
as
I LOVE it! I don't know how I could be without it. Would recommend it to every person I know.
Have to say that my but hole has never been cleaner at even twice the price it is the bomb
The best
Very nice. Wish it would massage too.
"Easy to install, easy to operate."
Excellent. Convenient and reliable.
Truly a life upgrade :)
"7/24/18

First of, I did not buy mine from Amazon. I bought it from an authorized distributor. I bought the Round version.

Things that I like:

• fits my Kohler round toilet perfectly, no overhang
• pressure is adequate for me but it requires to be at its highest setting. This has a less pressure in comparison to manual bidets or other competitors. YMMV
• warm seat. But I’m only going to use this during winter months

Things that I don’t like:

• it took me about 2 hrs to install it due to the leakage. I have to drive to the store to buy a washer to replace the one Toto has.

**HERE’S THE FIX THAT WORKED FOR ME. The blue o-ring that comes with the junction valve (T valve) does not provide a good seal. So I bought one from Dale’s Hardware (see attached photo). It’s an Assorted Aerator Washer (5 assorted black rings, the blue rings in the pic are the original o-rings that came from toto). They don’t cost much ($3). Only one black ring worked for me though. That one has the similar size with that of the original blue o-ring but about 2 mm thicker. You can experiment what works for you. But it did stopped the pesky leakage issue.

• the seat wiggles a little bit side to side but not significant for it to be a dealbreaker
• the toilet hole is a little bit small compare to what I’m used to
• the open/close control only works with the toilet seat. I doesn’t control the toilet lid.
• expensive $$$

Comments:

• I haven’t experienced that it is noisy compare to other people
• I haven’t tested the deodorizer
• I didn’t need a sensor cover despite opening the door of the restroom nor coming in to wash my face in the sink. It did not trigger the sensor. Although coming directly would automatically open the seat. I still turned off the feature because there’s no wall separating the bathroom and restroom.
• I’m satisfied despite the cons. Will update after a year of using this."
"Update:
After contacted Toto, the customer service decided to repair my unit without any charge.
It was troublesome to have defective washlets for three times in three years, however the customer service saved the issue this time. So I recommend not to give up when your washlet gets broken.

This product has defect in the design or something.
three years ago, I purchased two of S350e.
One got broken just before one year, did not release water from the wand, then it was replaced by warranty.
The replaced one got broken one year later again with same issue, water does not come out, then repair was needed for replacing the wand, it costed me more than 200 dollars.
now the other S350e started making noise during moving the wand, finally the wand stuck in the middle.
I'm tired of this product, I'm not willing to pay 200 dollars for this defective washlet.
I lost my entire trust to Toto, instead of continuosly paying $200 every year to Toto (almost like donations!) I'll look for other companies products. Good bye Toto forever!"
"Not posting this to reiterate the quality and features of this product. I just have to say that there is a reduction in space due to the mechanical components in the rear that require the seat to be smaller and situated more forward than a conventional seat on a round bowl. Ok, so how do I say this - I'm 6' 185 lbs, on the muscular side with an average to small bottom. I had to learn to sit all the way back on the seat, which is fine, almost 360 degree support. My legs don't fall asleep after sitting too long. Why do I have to sit so far back? Because my man bits touch the inside of the bowl in the front if I don't - and it's not because I have some special endowment. So even sitting all the way back, this is a bit of an issue. Then I move forward when I turn on the water, even with the sprayer all the way back. In addition, for a man, when standing up, you lose some of the space in the rear, so you have to adjust your aim for that. So what I'm saying is, this product would work much better with an elongated toilet bowl and the seat designed for it."
"So I bought this product 5 years ago, and so I’m coming back after 5 years to give you my thoughts. The positives: it’s given solid performance over these 5 years, but I can’t compare to any other bidet since I’ve never used any other.

The bad. I paid roughly $800 for this, and I use Toto products a lot - sinks and toilets. Thought this would be a nice luxurious feature for the master. Well, it broke on me after 4 years. Pretty much just me using it. I paid $250 to Toto to have them have someone do in-home service. I could have sent it out for $175 but then I would have to buy a new seat and I didn’t want to deal with it. 8 months later, 2 weeks ago, the house cleaner somehow broke the bidet - the soft close mechanism broke. Fortunately there is a 1-year warranty from the previous service, but alas no more in-home service. They are supposed to send me a box to send it in, but it’s been 2 weeks and they haven’t sent it yet. If Toto would have some spare parts available I could probably fix it myself, but they don’t. So now here I am having to lift up the seat and bring it down each time. I’m not complaining because I’m some male chauvinist, I literally have to do this or else the cover will automatically close and slam the seat that is now broken.

Had I known all these problems I probably would have never bothered to buy this."
"Was introduced to the Toto Washlet while in Japan with my Japanese spouse. Returned home and bought one. Performed well for 3 years before it trouble began. First the wand stopped having enough power to clean properly. Next instead of the bowl being cleaned after use the wand extends and shoots toilet water 3 feet out onto water closet floor. We contacted TOTO in US and we’re told in home repair costs $250 and send to their facility for repair, at least $175. They won’t sell parts in US. Paid over $1000 and now those outrageous repair rates. Now inquiring in Japan for repair parts."
"The Amazon and Toto are denied the misleading answers about where is the seat made in? 8 months of use , it has a washer problem causing the water level goes low and Toto asks for the seal no. The label as the picture shows it is made in Malaysia.
I am lied when I use Amazon the search machine to looking for the product I want. Toto staff says some parts are made in Japan, but assembling the plate in Malaysia."
The manual appears to be created. By cut and paste! Go for to page 19 the go back to page 2 then back to 22 incase the battery is dead. All while having your legs go to sleep trying to get your butt sprayed off with warm water. Great for your tesla owners!
Did not notice the round seat description and we wanted an elongated shape. TOTO was kind enough to return 100% of our money so we could return it and order the right model. New product is GREAT! Only one thing would I suggest be changed. The small rectangular stops on the back lid could be made of a softer material. The seat clacks when it raises automatically. Terrific unit. ten out ten stars.
"Have a prior one and got this one for another toilet. Works well and no issues. Had this one for months now and the other one for well over a year. These newer versions are much better than the older ones. Do not recommend you go cheap with older models as they do not sit on the toilet nearly as well and sprayer is a bit different. The Toto ones work for kids as my 4 and 7yr old will trigger it. Tried a Brondell one but their weight will not trigger so the spray would not work.
Overall, highly recommend this seat. Also, hilarious when someone who is not expecting the seat to open walks in."
Received this product yesterday and couldn’t wait to take it for a spin. Rushed home from the post office and got right to work installing it. Install was a breeze. Maybe took about an hour. Once I was done I plugged it in and the lid opened with a friendly hello. I couldn’t resist taking a seat. Even though I didn’t have to go I just had to try out all the setting. The seat was nice and warm. Then I turned on the jets and instantly had warm water spraying in all the right spots. It was heavenly. The oscillating function added a bit more to the entertainment. Once I was done with that the air dryer dried up my behind and sadly my adventure had come to an end. This product is worth the price and I look forward to my next adventure.
"The look is the best among all the toilet seats I've seen. Functions wise, every woman should use it for personal hygiene reason. I should have bought it long time ago. I live in a condo, and had a hard time trying to figure out if it can be installed on my smaller toilet (only 1.5"" length from the middle of two holes to the most protruding part of the water tank, not 1.75"" as mentioned in the installation guide). I took the risk and bought it anyway as I love the look of this toilet seat. It ended up with NO problem at all. The size of the round shape is just right for me but I'm petite, not sure if there is enough room for a man.

Two areas need to be improved:
1. the automate sensor is too sensitive and annoying. It should be designed in a way for user to wave or tap before it can be activated;
2. the default water pressure is NOT enough. Although you can set the water pressure to a preferred level based on user, it's annoying that you'll have to press the Front or Rear function button and THEN the user button each time you use it.

I hope Toto will listen to customer's feedback and improve this product."
"I've had this product for several months now, and it's been excellent. I love feeling so clean! The only issue I've had with it is that the remote sometimes doesn't get the signal to the seat on every button press sometimes, but that's not a big deal. It seems to be related to the angle the remote is held at. I aim it a little bit down, toward the floor, and it works fine."
"Go for the longer toillet seat. It is better for men.....
Otherwise it is a fantastic product that leave my toilet bowl perfectly clean like my bottom."
"Got it on a timely fashion, just installed it and going to try it out!"
easy to install
"Superb product! Works as described...
Highly recommended. I finally have my own ""throne""."
Great product and great service from Amazon.
Easy to install. We love it.
life changing product. we like it so much.
"Amazing product!
Highly recommended"
Love this bidet. Functions as expected. The only thing i would change about it is that the remote buttons need to be backlit.
"I had my first toto washout S300E from 2013 to 2021. It worked flawlessly but then had a serious breakdown. The repairs was estimated at half the price of a new one and would have taken 2-3 weeks. The wait and the uncertainty was a deal breaker for me, since it's being used by a disabled person. I got a replacement S500e the day after I ordered it from Amazon. It took the plumber about an hour to replace the old one. So far, no complaints. It's a life saver for the disabled and infirm, and it's a pleasure to use for the able-bodied. I paid a little over $800 for S300E. S500E is marginally a better product and costs a little more or, about the same, figuring in amortization and inflation. Reportedly they last 15 years. I was less lucky but 9 years for a product in constant use is not so bad. Bravo, Toto!"
"There is a leaking issue in the T-adapter for the water supply which leaked, in my case, but can be solved. My ballcock float has a plastic fitting with a conical end which does not mate with the metal T-adapter's fiber washer and leaks. One popular solution is to insert brass or conical rubber washers, another is to get the THU9090 extension hose. However, after installing a Toto S550e yesterday, I would encourage purchasing the Fluidmaster PRO45B Adjustable Ballcock. The brass shank will make the installation of the stock Toto parts much easier. I did use plumbers tape on the metal-to-metal threads. I don't have to worry about any cracks from plastic fatigue, distortion of the plastic parts from a ""true"" round shape, and having metal parts is just very reassuring (especially after cross-threading the old float's shank after trying trying a couple different cone-shaped and brass washers). I was able to install the new float easily and after removing the old one could set the correct height of the new float by matching the length of the parts. Yes, it's $15 (vs $4 for the washers) but now I never have to give leaks or flooding a 2nd thought, and it is far less money than the THU9090 extension hose route which negatively keeps it all plastic."
"Yes, this was not a cheap buy.

But after using this, its become a necessity. You will be spoiled so quickly and never look back."
Love it. Had it for 3 years and no issues. Sent one to my mother who has IBS. She loves it and has been using it for 2 years.
"Easy to install, did not require any additional parts. As others have mentioned since your connecting metal and plastic fittings, make sure to go slow and not over-tighten or strip the threads. Easy to use although takes a little getting used to. It also reduces the size of your toilet since the back is raised, so I find myself sitting more forward.

I chose this model over S550e since the light can be bright/annoying and I don't need the toilet to open/close on its own. I prefer to open and close when I need to rather than grab the remote, push a button, and wait.

Only negative would be I wish the remote was backlight. If your using the toilet in the dark at night, you really need to turn on a light to see the buttons since they are touch sensitive.

Oh, and make sure you have a power outlet with GFCI (failure to do so is a major electrical risk). I installed one behind the toilet."
"My last bidet broke after 7 years. I love this model, the remote's soft touch is great, the auto cleaning, and it's gentler than my last bidet."
"Once the seat is installed, its freedom of movement to the left and right is more than I would have expected; the seat felt loose until I placed some electrical tape in the latching mechanisms.

The sensor for the pre-mist is too sensitive. The pre-mist regularly deploys when you are on the other side of the bathroom and sometimes even when you are walking down the hallway.

I did not find the buttons on the remote to be intuitive. For example, ""stop"" is just a blank spot with no label. The remote is fine once you get used to it, but I worry my guests will not be able to use the bidet as well as they might.

And the spray pressure is not sufficiently strong to clean your backside. My previous bidet, which was a non-electric one, was much better in this regard."
"Overall, this is a great washlet. Installation is easy (but see below for the problem: leaks). The instructions aren't great but Toto has a video that makes it simple to install. The remote is simple and intuitive. It fits well and looks good.

I wish I could give it 5 stars, but for such an expensive product it's really a shame that so many people including me have problems with leaks after installing it.
I read the instructions and watched the video and followed them to a tee.
And like so many other people, I had a small leak at the T-junction where the Tee meets the toilet fill tube.
My toilet is a Toto Ultramax-II, so I thought it wouldn't be a problem but it still leaked slowly.

The solution is simple: go to the hardware store and buy a small cone-shaped rubber grommet. I added a very thin coat of silicon grease and no other washers (make sure the grommet is flat on the bottom), and with that it no longer leaks. For a washlet this expensive, Toto should supply the correct parts and leaks should not happen to so many consumers.

Other than that, it has been great."
"This is the greatest thing you could buy on Amazon, maybe planet earth in the year 2019. Your wife/husband will thank you for years to come when you purchase this Toto Bidet. It is honestly the most wonderful experience you can have legally. It is not cheap but it is worth SO much more than $925. Put a price on something that replenishes your soul daily.
Dont save money here. You don't buy the cheapest toilet paper so spend the dough and have the best.

You need to have a plug behind the toilet. If you do not have one then one must be installed before thinking about this most wonderful asscleansing solution. The bidet toilet seat is a very easy install.

If you have never enjoyed a fine bidet, you will be crushed, devastated once you feel the love you have been robbed of your entire life. Temp & pressure is adjustable, male and female settings more options than we deserve as humans. This is a gift from the Gods."
"I can’t believe I hadn’t caught onto bidets sooner. This is one of those few items I would say is a must have. It doesn’t even need to be this model, just get a bidet. It’s so much more sanitary. This one is good. Has all of the features you would want. The water+ pre rinse doesn’t seem to keep our toilet bowl cleaner longer but it does help keep crap from sticking when doing the business. The dryer is powerful but because of the lack of angle, it takes a bit to dry up the crevice. A couple sheets of toilet paper does the trick. It keeps itself clean quite well and cleans you up really well. Most of the times my toilet paper comes up spotless when drying. The on demand water heating is good but we notice ours isn’t always consistent when in use. It will go from warm to warmer to lukewarm to warm and warmer again. The underglow lighting is a nice add on when you are going at night in the dark, no night light necessary. The biggest negative id say is the toilet seat itself becomes smaller since the back uses up space for all of the hardware. Some people might dislike that. If you want to maintain your toilet seats footprint for your buttprint, I would look elsewhere. It took me a little getting used to but it doesn’t bother me anymore. Oh and the touch controller is OK, I prefer physical buttons."
"Toto, where have you been all my life? This product is amazing and everyone needs to have one or two installed in their house! A few years ago I had heard about this product but thought it would be too expensive, but with the option of just having the toilet seat and not the entire commode this product is amazingly affordable! We absolutely love the toto and tell all our friends and family. After visiting Europe and experiencing a bidet we realized how much this was needed. There is no better ""clean"" option, love it! The heated seat, the fact that it pre-cleans then after cleans, lights up and cleans front to back is incredible! I have a toilet closet and I did have to have an electrician put an outlet next to it and a plumber install it but it was quick easy and worth every penny!"
Great product. Still working great after nearly 3 years of constant use.
"After the pandemic I became interested in bidets so I did my research and selected this one. I have never owned one, never used one, always wanted one, and I will always judge myself for the before-times! The seat warmer is great, the heated water is fantastic, and if you’re toying with getting this Toto you would be foolish not to! Easy to install and the first time I used it, I WISH I had done a user-experience video because I could’ve sold thousands of these things! Try it and never look back!"
I’ve had a TOTO washlet for 20 years. I used to work in Tokyo regularly and quickly came to realize this is the only sanitary way to stay clean and you’ll pay for it in a couple of years with what you save on toilet paper. This is a higher-end unit that continually will spray hot water (versus the cheaper ones that use a tank which only give you about 30 to 40 seconds of warm water).
"We purchased a Toto k300 for our half bath in the living room area, and the more expensive s500e for our master bath, and have used both for several months now. Overall, I LOVE having upgraded to a Toto seat, and don't think I would ever go back. If you are thinking about one of these seats, absolutely do it.

As for the comparison between both seats, I am not convinced the price difference between the k300 and the s500e is worth it. They both look similar, heat the same, have the same hot water capacity and the bidet and blower function is essentially the same. The silver s500e remote is a bit sleeker looking, but the k300 tan remote works fine. The biggest difference between the two is the fact the s500e lights up the bowl which when going in the middle of the night is a nice feature, but not worth the several hundred dollar upgrade in my opinion. The big feature that the s500e is supposed to have is the EWATER feature but I have not noticed a difference, and both bowls need cleaning at the same rate (even though arguably the half bath in the living area gets more use than the master bath). I will also say that having a Toto seat doesn't completely negate the need for toilet paper as some hope for, though that may just be from me being impatient lol.

FYI this remote can be a bit difficult to figure out--you have to slide your finger over the control panel to adjust the force and forward/backward location of the bidet rather than press the +/- keys like on the other remote. (This took me a while and a YouTube search to figure out.)

Overall: buy one of these, but the k300 is going to give you essentially the same experience at a lower price point. 4 stars because of this, but a 5 start experience!"
"If you have an electric outlet near your toilet, it's a very easy install. As stated by others, the seat is not very comfortable but I don't advocate people seating on toilet seats too long. The reduced use of toilet paper is minimal because I still pat myself dry before using the dryer in order to be more expedient. But it's a gentle, comfortable way to feel completely clean without rubbing. This is most important if you have hemorrhoids. My only complaints are that is should be more comfortable and cheaper. I only hope that it works long enough to make the seat worth the price."
"Very easy to install, all functions work as expected. Instant and continuous warm water and warm air for drying. Most independent reviews rate Toto S500E and S550E as the best add on Bidets on the market. I am very happy with the performance and looks."
Great product at a great price. We have had this product before in other homes and it never disappoints.
"Really good product. The various functions work well and the pre-spraying of the toilet bowl is so much more useful than I could've ever realized. It stays much cleaner and now I'm wondering why all toilets don't have this as a standard function for cleanliness. It does keep tripping the grounded electrical outlet though. It didn't the first few days, but it started thereafter and has to be reset every other time. Nothing changed and the outlet is used to plug in anything else.
The remote control took a minute to figure out. I actually ended up having to read the manual to know how to use it. All other bidets I've used in the past seemed to be a little more intuitive. Since I like all the extra functions that this TOTO has, reading the manual was prudent. I thought having a light turn on in the bowl when you approached was a little ""extra"", but it turns out that I love that. I don't have to turn on the bathroom light when I get up during the night.
I've wanted to purchase this for a few years and so I DID IT as I transformed my bathroom to my own little decadent space.

Within a week of my purchase, Amazon decreased the price by almost $100. That was pretty irritating to me since I've already paid to have it installed and can't return it and repurchase it."
"This was supposed to be a Christmas gift for my wife. She liked it in the first two weeks until it started to smell. The air dry unit became moldy and started to smell. Due to the smell, I had to clean this often. It is the Bentley of toilet seats. You will need to hire an electrician to wire in an additional electrical outlet in next to the toilet. The reason why is because you need to plug this in. I had to purchase a cord extension but it’s still wasn’t enough which made it difficult to install.

- I loved the heated seats but it can really make your butt be very toasty.
- Having the warm water function is very helpful and useful.
- I wish there was a way to dim the lighting and the auto function because my son has a sensory issue which made it difficult for him to be potty trained or go to our bathroom.
- having a remote is ok. I can really do it without. I think having controls on side is ok because remote can be lost if you don’t mount it to the wall

Overall, it was a good function but we had to return it due to the smell or the wiring function."
"Took us about 1.5 hours to install. We are novices. I actually did all the installation because the toilet room was to snug for my hubby to fit next to the toilet when he was on his back.

Make sure when you tighten the tubing to the tank the component in the toilet tank doesn't rotate.
Ours did and when we turned the water on it would not stop running. I ran into the guest bathroom to see what that tank looks like inside and discovered the that the little arm was being held down and could not come all the way up to shut the water off. We weren't worried about it over flowing but it was a scary event since we are sheltering in place.

We installed the remote to the wall too. Be sure to unplug the unit if you sit on the toilet and hold the remote while installing. We did not and the wand came out and got my hubby's pants wet on the rear end. It was a good laugh.
It takes a bit to learn the features. We are on day 4 and we decided when we are not using the toilet room to close the door because the motion sensitivity makes the washlet think that we are ready to use and prepare for us to sit down."
*
"The question attached to this box, What did you use this product for?, is comical. The Washable by Toto is everything I was hoping for. It does its advertised job period, end of story.

It did have some getting used to. For the first week, I found myself laughing most of the time because, well it is different. It tickles which really made me laugh. Each discovered feature which includes, water temperature, strength of spray, type of spray and location of the spray allows you to do what each occasion calls for .

This product was simple to install and does what it is supposed to do which I am very grateful for. I do think however that, with so many years of producing this product, that brail type markings or a finger type light on the side of each feature on the remote would be helpful in the dark as well as for visually impaired people. Why would Toto limit the customers their product would be useful for?"
"I've owned 3 other bidets over the last decade or so. They've all had the great feature of an enema wash, without even saying it is a feature. I thought all bidets do this by design, until I tried the Toto S500E. For some reason Toto decided to go ""anti-enema wash"" and purposely design it so it has ZERO enema effect. If you have never experienced a bidet enema wash, I feel sorry for you because you have not fully experienced true clean and a true bidet. Even the budget priced Intelliseat bidet I bought a while back at Costco gives you a great enema wash. I really wanted to like this S500E. This was my first try with the Toto brand. Yes, it's definitely overpriced but I was ready to try it. It has many high end features such as the e-water premist/postmist which I love, and the water pump motor is the quietest I have ever heard. But with no enema wash, that is a deal breaker. I have always regarded Toto as a high end bidet company and cannot believe this is how they designed this bidet. The wash is only a little better than using a portable squeeze bottle bidet. You're just washing the outside with some pressure. You cannot get an enema wash on this thing. I tried every nozzle adjustment and moved myself around on the seat. It is impossible because the water spray angle is way off (too flat). Toto says they designed the angle of the spray to ""prevent backsplash onto the wand"". Well, their design team sure went overboard on that concept...so far that they compromised the wash! I can't believe it. Terrible design, terrible compromise. For the price they charge, it's unforgivable. This Toto is being returned. They should have spent more time on a proper nozzle design instead of a fancy remote. I'm going back to BioBidet. See ya."
"The Toto S550e is the luxury you need in your bathroom even if you don't know you needed it. You will need a 110w outlet near the rear or side of toilet. After traveling to Japan 10 years ago I have been wanting a washlet. Finally when there was a leak in my bathroom wall the moment to rip out the wall and install a GFI electrical outlet. The seat was easy to install if you read the instructions. Not only does my entire family love this thing so does my cat....who climbs on the seat to make the auto cleaning feature go. Just think of this: a heated seat in winter, a nightlight that turns on when you walk into bathroom in middle of night and most importantly you walk away from toilet in your cleanest possible state. Buy this and your bottom will thank you....and all your friends who visit your house. It has become a novelty in our home and a great conversation piece.
NOTE the S550e and S500 are almost identical but the remote is updated on the S550 to be very modern and brushed aluminum finish. It's really up to you if aesthetics are important for an extra $50 or so."
"It took me 40 minutes to install this washlet, with a few basic tools that most households should have. Against all advice, I am using a heavy duty power strip to power it for now, and once we are able to contract with an electrician, we'll get a dedicated GFI plug. The controls are very easy to understand and set. Without going into details, the difference between this bidet and tp is the difference between using a soft moisturizer cream on your skin or witch hazel. Covid will change many, many aspects of our daily lives. I hope that people look at a bidet as one of those changes. There are so many personal and environmental benefits it's crazy. I'm sure you could spend a few dollars less and get a washlet that fits your needs as this one fits mine, but I'm perfectly happy spending a few extra bucks for the features and confidence in a brand that's been doing bidets globally for many decades. I can't speak highly of how this product has improved my life."
"First the DIY tips:
1) Watch a youtube video.
2) the fiber washers work just fine.
3) the tee coupling attaches to the bottom of the tank, NOT that supply-line valve.
4) IMPORTANT attach the tee coupling to the bottom of the tank FIRST, before you attach the supply line or the washlet line to the tee. Over 90% of the tank float valves are plastic. If you don't get that steel tee coupling 100% properly seated on the bottom of the float valve, you will strip the valve's plastic threads (and it will leak) when you try to manhandle it on if you have already attached the other lines. Install took about 15 minutes.

Product review.

My wife and I have used dozens of these washlets in Japan - including the S550....that auto-open lid thing is really annoying, so we got the S500. This is about as good as a washlet gets. However, the adjustment of depth/length of the cleaning nozzle is a bit lack luster compared to some others that we used in Japan. Other than that I recommend this washlet"
"Washes well. I have found in my limited usage so far that even a man needs to use the ""woman"" setting.. in my case not doing so didn't clean as well. Be aware the spray is pretty focused.... The first time you use the ""Man"" setting, well, it was a shock.

It pre rinses as you walk in the bathroom and lights up.
The auto clean does seem to run once a night by itself. Other reviewers said it was loud. It is not loud but it sounds like maybe a weak electric toothbrush? Not an issue for us.
This has not left a trace of stuff in the bowl and I do think the pre rinse is why.
The seat cover is rather large."
All that money and I have to buy another two adapters to for a TOTO bidet seat to fit a TOTO TOILET. What has this world come to honestly. Wish I could review the toilet bidet but waiting for my next shipment of t adapters. I highly recommend d if you have a skirted toilet to buy the 3/8 x 3/8 x 1/2 in T adapter with another 1/2 adapter to that t adapter.
"Ok...so this is the kind of thing that most people don't seem to talk about so I don't think most people realize just how great bidets are. And this one is outstanding. Certainly not the cheapest, but hey...you're going to use it at least once a day, why not splurge. Without being overly graphic, this does a great job at...cleaning. You'll feel cleaner and fresher and use much less TP. We installed ours just before the pandemic started, so it's been an added bonus to not worry about having to find TP! As you would expect on a high end model, there are a ton of adjustments on this bidet allowing you to customize it just how you like. And it remembers the presets of two different users. Spend the money...you won't regret it!"
"It’s hard to understand how groovy washlets are until one gets brave and tries it out. Basically, think of any situation ... for women or for anyone ... wherein things could get messy or extra cleaning would be helpful.

There are many levels of Toto features and this is the one I like the best. I’m a repeat customer. I like the look & feel of the remote control (attached to wall in location I want), the variable temperature of seat & water (which I alter seasonally), and the front/ back/ oscillating / pulsing/ streaming options. Self cleaning of wand after use is obviously a good idea. My cat loves the motion-sensor nightlight and pre-misting (he goes nuts over running water) and I prefer how this model does NOT inc. auto sensor toilet seat raise/ lower (but you might with toilets frequently used by men).

Oh, and for some reason, at the time we bought this here, it was $500 ($700?) less on Amazon than direct from Toto’s website. (I paid website price the 1st 2 times.)"
"Pros: Heated seat, heated water, slow close seat/lid, deodorizing and self-cleaning features work well, bidet settings offer many options/adjustments, looks nicer than I thought it would

Cons: Pricey, you also need an outlet right near the toilet to use it, the outer lid is a rather flimsy plastic that can scratch easily and feels cheap for the price you've paid. The light only stays on for a few seconds. This could have been a great feature if it stayed on in the dark for a full minute or if the timer was configurable via the remote, but this fantastic light feature is wasted on the fact that it shuts off too quickly.

Summary: I'm happy I own this and it's spoiled me to where I miss all its features when using other toilets in my house, but it's a little pricey and for the money it could feel a little more solidly built and should allow the timer on the in-bowl light to be user-configurable."
"Overall the product is really well thought out and designed. It is relatively easy to install.

Leaves you feeling clean and is straight forward to use.

The only issue I had was there there was a very minor cosmetic crack in a part of the base unit. I don’t think it was the Seller or Amazon’s fault both boxes were pristine and the Toto box itself was clearly brand new and unopened. Was able to repair with a little plastic glue I had and you would never notice it.

Would buy again."
"A bidet? It seemed scary or so foreign to my silly American sensibilities. But when toilet paper was being hoarded by crazy people during the start of the pandemic, I wondered if this would help slow our own TP consumption. It has! And after getting over the ""mystery"" of how this all works and cleans — I can honestly say I will never go back! The warm seat is the best in the morning and its gentle and honestly somewhat shocking at how well it cleans. Plus, the features and remote really make this brand stand out. This is well-built, we have had no issues and well, is actually reached the status of ""I will never have a home without one"" for us."
"Firstly this thing is super duper over priced. The materials are all soft plastic so don't expect the toilet seat to remain in perfect condition for very long. The instruction manuals are all full over warnings to only clean with specific types of cloths, in particular warning that wiping up with toilet paper will scratch the thing. If this was $400 instead of $800 (or the ridiculous MSRP of $1500) it would be worth the money. Alternately if they used actual high-end materials instead of the same cheap-feeling plastic that's been used to cheaply churn out products for decades it might also be worth the asking price.

Other observations:
- It was fairly easy to install.
- Having a bidet toilet seat is awesome.
- The remote works well even though it's on the opposite end of the seat from the receiver.
- It's super handy at night that the unit lights up the toilet bowl when it senses someone approaching, but it turns off the light way too quickly in any case, and if you lift the seat the light turns out immediately. This is a total missed opportunity for a very useful night toilet/bathroom light! In fact I've heard the slightly more expensive version (with the motorized lid) has an external light that was even designed as a night light, but turns off way too quickly. Unfortunate!"
"Love almost everything about this bidet (we have 2). The only complaint we have is that the lid scratches incredibly easily, and trying to buff/polish it out only makes it worse. So never, ever rest anything on top of the lid, even momentarily."
"I don't think I can ever go back to normal toilets. I was genuinely surprised at how many spray types and pressures the Washlet offers, especially when paired with a variety of temperature settings. I genuinely feel cleaner than using normal toilet paper and all the settings work towards making sure you're kept comfortable. The heated seat is such a smart addition, especially since my bathroom is in a colder part of the house. It will definitely be welcomed in the winter months. The only problem I found was the wireless remote. It takes some getting used to since the symbols are not clear and user friendly, and I felt like I shouldn't be subjected to ""trial and error."" The remote also suffers from connectivity and response issues. But these are minor qualms in the grand scheme of things. I whole-heartedly suggest people upgrade their bathroom life with a Washlet."
"As a typical 'murican this takes some getting used to, but this seat has become the most popular in the house. I just want to call attention to two observations that are perhaps less common:
1. The seat itself is not the most comfortable in the world. If you have IBS and spend considerable time on the pot this will make your cheeks sore after a while. But at least they will be warm cheeks.
2. The automatic deodorizer is amazing. Flipping on the bathroom fan used to be an absolutely essential part of #2 behavior in our house, but no more. The little fan in this seat draws in the evil satanic fumes of the nether regions and emits a completely odorless stream of clean air. I would never have believed it possible if I had not witnessed it with my own nose. So the deodorizer feature is not just marketing crap - it is absolutely 100% true!"
"really nice with lots of adjustments. Like all Toto stuff it works exactly like they say it will (For those of you who don't know Toto is the Rolls Royce of bathroom stuff). My wife wanted this because her friends had these so its off to the computer to get one for us. I was a little confused by the models - The one I got didn't automatically open when you come into the room (thank God) but it was easy to install, works good and the remote was easy to figure out after reading the manual (Yep, I actually red the manual) Remember, this thing needs a 120 Volt household outlet and we had to add one in the bathroom.

So if your wife can't live without one of these this is a good one to get. Pricey - but Toto is the best stuff."
"This is the third Toto washlette I own, and it really hits the sweet spot (no pun intended) of price, quality and features. It works very well, and the remote is the best I have seen from the company. Never runs out of warm water. I like the ewater thing, which really does seem to help keep the bowl clean. I also like the low profile of this version, which makes it less obtrusive. I had previously bought another brand (Brondell), but it did not last as long as the Totos do.

I got convinced that these things were the civilized, ecological and effective way to go after spending a few months in Japan. Folks in the States seem kind of scared of them. But after you use one awhile, the old way just seems rather primitive and crude."
"I wish I’d invested in a washlet years ago. This TOTO model has the right functionality and features for a luxurious master bath. The 500E does not have the automated toilet lid which is perfect for home use. Do not buy the 550E unless you want the toilet lid to raise up everytime you walk by the bathroom door.

The just in time water heater and heated blow dryer insures an opulent experience. The precision and water pressure help insure excellent hygiene. It also has energy star options that work well if you are away from your home for stretches of a day."
"its absurdly expensive but it works well
rigged ours to an electric lift, took five minutes to install. just screw on the holder and the toilet seat snaps into it. bought the hose extension and didn't end up needing it, returned it. dryer puts out a weird smell but we're hoping that goes away with time.
not much else to say."
"Easy to install if GFCI outlet nearby. Hose connection well designed. Don’t need wide front feature, so next lower model would be OK. Due to components housed in back, unit is a little clunky in appearance. Odour control works well. water heater works well."
"Better than my original Toto Washlet-
I had a Toto Washlet for the past 13 years. It was great and reliable. It finally began to malfunction - I ordered this replacement immediately!
I was on the fence about the eWater; I'm very glad that i got it, it is a huge improvement over the original.
I was worried that the washlet would trigger ewater every time i walked into my small bathroom - It does not. It only triggers if i step directly in front of it. The few times that it does trigger is no big deal; it is very quick and quiet.
I am impressed at the improvements made over my earlier model."
"I love this so much. Ihad A shoulder replacement really needed this. It is perfect except it goes off every time I walk past the bathroom. The sensor is extremely sensitive. There has to be a fix for this ?? Can anyone help with this problem, otherwise it is the best luxury I have purchased. TOTO has the best....... when we were in Hawaii was introduced to this fabulous contraption. Someone told me America is way behind in bathroom toliets, I must agree. Don’t hesitate to buy this luxury.... came in a few days and was not that hard to install
Looks wonderful on our toilet. Extremely COMFORTABLE."
"Imagine you need to use a public toilet. You get to the toilet and at the back of the seat is a block of wood forcing you to use the front 2/3 of the seat. There you have the Toto S500e series made in Malaysia.
It is nothing like the older Toto Jasmine series made in Japan. That design had a normal flat toilet seat and was very comfortable. Why the S500e series tilts up 2/3 of the way back is a mystery. They both have water tanks.

The S500e with all its features for me still requires the same waste cleaning as the Jasmine. AND the water stream seems weaker, despite what the specs say. I bought this thinking it was a close replacement to the Jasmine. Wrong. I actually hate the unit. If you have never experienced the original Toto Jasmine you might be happy. If I recall correctly there was another Japanese wash-let competitor, but I cant find them now."
"I have wanted this toilet seat since I went to Japan two years ago. I do not regret this purchase in the slightest. I use it (even when I don't really need to) and it's a splash at parties. Ha ha. I highly recommend reading the maintenance manual and cleaning the components regularly to get the full life out of the product. I do not have a TOTO toilet, but had no trouble with the installation. We did replace the water pipe at the connection to the wall with a shorter one and installed a power outlet closer to the toilet to hide the cable, otherwise, everything we needed was included with the product."
"I had the opportunity to experience the use of Washlet toilet seats on a trip to Japan and have been wanting one ever since. I finally went ahead and ordered it, only to find out that it is best that it has its own circuit. Once that was addressed, though, I think the overall installation was easy enough. I am very happy with my purchase. I recently took a short trip and missed not having it while I was away. Being able to stay clean throughout the day seems like a healthy thing to do."
"This is revolutionary for us...we have been talking about it for a year or so, and decided to go ahead in light of the TP shortages. Very easy to install. The remote takes a bit of getting used to, but it’s not bad. I thought It would be ok, but would still need to clean up after, but that is not the case. Straight up life changing for us, can’t express enough how much we like this product. Hoping it lasts a long time."
This Toto bidi is built deferentially from previous one we ordered. Remote not well built as the previous one. Function working. The top model was not in stock so we ordered this one. Needed my wife’s help to remove old Toto that died after 5 years. Install requires following instruction booklet & a second person.
"Just got it, already love it. I suspect it will eventually pay for itself as paper continues to rise! Regardless, it is worth every penny."
"This review is more about the seller, Medial LLC, than it is about the product. Medial LLC was the seller and it was shipped by Amazon. It arrived new and in good condition but there was a small missing part that is crucial to installation. Washlet cannot be installed without the part. There are supposed to be two of this part and there was only one. From experience I know that this happens with Toto every now and then. So Toto is definitely to blame. But I contacted the seller through Amazon process and Medial LLC never responded. I do have the option of returning to Amazon for a refund but I found the part online and since I got the Toto at a very good price it made sense to me to just buy the part. My total cost is still less than what this model normally sells for."
"Works great for me, but my wife and 9 year old daughter claim it misses the mark spraying them. The sprayer is non adjustable so users must force themselves to move into uncomfortable positions to use.

My wife says the bidet feature misses mark badly and is next to useless.

Everyone does like the heated seat."
"I've wanted one of these for years. In fact, I had an electrical outlet installed 6 or 7 years ago for one. I finally decided to go ahead and get one when so many people are hoarding toilet paper. So far, I am really happy I did."
Just having a seat that can do so much makes my bathroom experience great. The heated seat relaxes me. Knowing that I have sprays and a dryer gives me a clean feeling after use. Overall this product is great and an immediate show-off when guests come over to my house. Highly recommended and I will get an additional Washlet for my guest bathroom once I add another GFCI outlet.
"This Toto Washlet seemed nicer than the S300 model we had BUT IT'S DEAD NOW.

Contacting Toto for assistance.

Update!

So there is a power button on the remote which is on the back side. I don't know how mine got turned off, but I guess it did. So after holding in the power button for about five seconds, the washlet came back to life.

I am sooooo relieved. To not have a washlet is to be a barbarian."
Toto makes great toilets and toilet bidets. I was not disappointed with the Washlet Bidet toilet seat. I took the advice of others and did not get the automatic seat feature because they found the seat is always going up and down when you walk into the bathroom and most times you go in and don’t need to use the toilet. Easy to install and easy to use. Top quality and well engineered.
"Love this seat. In fact, I bought two of them. I love everything about them from how they operate to just about any adjustment (heat, power, angle of spray), you can think of. The instruction book is really really helpful and I've used it many times to understand all the things I can program. I highly recommend this product!"
"I am super disappointed with this washlet. This thing is super expensive - that being said, it should include some of the otherwise impossible to find parts. I installed a wall-mounted toilet. This is NOT compatible with the installation equipment provided and the parts needed apparently are not available. I don't even know if I will be able to find the parts at all. If I can find a way to rig this unit up to a standard 1/2"" pipe, there will be a mess of connections coming out of the wall - including a cap, because the connection they give is unique and the hose is not replaceable. I am extremely irritated by the lack of flexibility. I may not even be able to find the parts to connect the water supply. I am very annoyed. Also I bought a ""used like new"" and the lid was completely scratched everywhere in all directions like someone went over it with sand paper."
The bidet toilet seat works exactly right. A plumber did the installation and to help insure things would go right I replaced a Kholer toilet and ordered from a local store a new Toto toilet which was on sale. The plumber said he has installed a number of these bidets so that was no problem.
"The Toto washet is a fantastic product. Elegant design, high end technology that does what it says it will do. Easy to install on existing toilets as a replacement lid. Works flawlessly, much more sanitary .. I may never buy a roll of toilet paper again!"
I must have a Toto washlet in every home I own. This one in particular provides a comfortable spray that cleans well. Don’t expect to get dry without first patting dry with TP though. Remote is touch sense and sometimes doesn’t read my finger so I have to hit multiple times or maybe I should read instructions to do it correctly.
This bidet seat is really great. Installation was straight-forward and we haven't had any issues with it after having it for a couple of months. My hubby really enjoys a warm seat in the middle of the night!
"The installation was not easy. I had a problem with it due to the leaking attachment to the toilet plumbing. The toilet seat is not comfortable. The prewash is good and the lighted toilet bowl when you enter the bathroom is also a good feature. But for the price, this washlet is not worth it."
"Love this TOTO.
#1 BRAND in Japan.
I used 19Y for 1st WASHLET.
Easy to install and use.
Very clean and comfortable.
I would recommend to anyone.
Once you have one of these, you will not go back to toilet paper again."
"I intended to put in a bidet, but my plumber suggested this instead. Warm seat, warm water, warm air, and it deodorizes and even cleans itself without added chemicals. And it’s much less expensive. What’s not to like?"
"Product is great, however I got a bad washer, and had to hire a plumber for an extra $200. For nearly $1000, I would expect their plumbing supplies to be perfect. Regardless I am very happy with the product over all"
"I bought the more expensive model and it shows. There is real quality here. It freaks out our cat, though. He cannot figure out how that thing knows he is approaching and it automatically turns itself on."
I bought this as a replacement for an 8 year old Toto bidet seat. It was so easy to install and works wonderfully! I recommend this product. Make sure it will fit on your toilet. We have a Toto toilet that fits it perfectly.
"Safe, clean, oderless, warm and sanitary, a delight to use."
The expense of adding an AC outlet by the toilet plus help from a plumber to install (not difficult- I just didn’t trust myself) added up. But (Butt?) all very worth it.
"Fantastic product. Well made. Good price. Works as advertised. Simple installation as a retrofit to an existing toilet. Need power source near toilet. After that, plug it in and it’s ready to go."
This item is superb. It performs way beyond my expectations. The only thing that needs to improve is the installation instructions; they are a bit unclear and the video posted on line is somewhat misleading.
Love my TOTO Washlet seat! The heated seat and adjustable spray setting are my favorite part about this product. This has definitely improved my bathroom experience and I always want my guests to try it out. Would love to buy one for my other bathroom as well!
"We love the Toto bidet seat, everything works just fine and it’s easy to program, my wife and I are very pleased!"
I am loving this. Best decision ever!
Have been waiting to get this for some time. Glad I did my homework as this is exactly what I wanted. I really like that the water is always the right temperature.
Bought the S500e modern look to replace a broken 5-year old S350e classic look. It's better and looks much than the original. I am completely satisfied.
The remote keypad should stay lit when the system is activated so you can see in the dark which keys you want to press when the time is needed.
Seat feels good when the bathroom is cold.
"It is relatively easy to install. Pictorial instruction at first confusing and overwhelming, but after few minutes of study I get familiarized with logic. Same for operating instruction."
We are older adults and have been pleased with the ToTo..it’s convenient and easy to use!
"Very nice Toto product.
The seat is perfect and meat all my expectations.
Very good and fast delivery.
Highly recommend."
"Live this Toto. This is my second one for the guest bathroom. Once you have one of these, you will not go back to toilet paper again."
"Worth every penny... We did not install this, we hired a plumber. Amazing! GO check it out!"
Quality workmanship. Water pressure not as strong as expected.
"This is the BEST purchase I have ever made!
I highly recommend everyone to get thi!"
"For the ultimate in comfort, hygiene, and cleanliness, This is better than we could have imagined !"
Lived in Japan for 9 years....not sure why I waited 4 years to have these installed stateside....they are worth every penny!
Product is amazing!! Not sure how I lived so long without it!
I had this installed by a contractor who didn’t have any complaints with the installation. I love my washlet.
"Easy install, took a bit to go through the instructions - but works flawlessly."
"Works Great! Yes it's ""pricey"" but worth it.
Remote control toilet seat! How Cool is that?"
Absolutely amazing! This will pretty much clean your soul! Every home should have this.
This really does the job. Easy to install and maintain.
"It’s great for all manners and matters of perineal care.

I never want to use facilities anywhere else, now."
Just love the bidet and highly recommend to anyone.
love the comfort
"Totally love it , and can’t imagine my life without it !"
"I have contacted the vendor twice, with no response. Don't know what happened to ""we'll contact you within 48 hours"". I have had toto seats for years and loved them. Most annoyed that I'm out $900+ and unable to get anyone to respond to my complaint! The remote control is a disaster!"
"Ad, picture and information are all accurate. A pleasure to have!"
"Amazing, what was I waiting for."
"Function and design are great! I have owned them for years, everyone should."
Excellent
Works just like the old one.
"If I could give zero stars I would. First, the installation instructions are horrible. Second, it didn't fit our plumbing and required a hex nipple adapter, third, the seat is really small and uncomfortable. It wobbled on the toilet despite following the horrible installation instructions. I was so happy to return the item and would absolutely not recommend it."
Works well
"excellent product, easy to install and works as advertised."
Would recommend to anyone
"After experiencing bidets in Japan, I knew we needed to get one in our own household. I can’t say enough good things about this Toto washlet. Love all the features like the auto opening and closing lid, seat warmer with adjustable temperature, washing with adjustable temperature and the optional pulsating/oscillating movement, and the dryer with adjustable temperature. I also appreciate the pre-mist feature and self-cleaning feature.

The installation was fairly easy, took under 15 minutes and fits our toilet pretty well. The only thing is the lid opens fast and slams against the toilet so I had to put a foam dot to act as a cushion, otherwise it would make a loud slamming noise.

The seat itself is comfortable, especially the nice warm seat!! Perfect for these cold mornings when you don’t want to shock yourself awake from a cold bottom, haha. Overall I highly recommend this to anyone."
"This product has all the features I expect, without any functions that is only fancy but unnecessary. The price is excellent, it's half of the retail price in the store.
I installed it on my existing toilet bowl. Installation is easy, just watch a YouTube video and the process is exactly like that. If you have an old house, the biggest challenge is probably dealing with the plumbing, or installing a power outlet in a tight spot. Fortunately for me, these were no issues. I don't even consider myself handy, yet I finished the installation pretty smoothly. No power tool is required, just a big flat head screw driver and a small cup to catch the dropping water when the water tube was disconnected from the tank. I did wrap some Teflon tape around all the water connectors. This is not in the installation instruction, but I always do that.
Once the power is connected, everything works perfectly. The only feature I disabled is the auto lid open/close, since my toilet is right next to my bathtub, I don't want it to welcome me when I am just about to take a bath. I can still open the seat (not the lid) with a button on the remote (see picture). If you have a private toilet closet, this auto lid open/close feature would be perfect for you.
All other features are very practical. It cleans, blows dry, filters the air, and cleans itself. There is no need to buy the Washlet+ model (integrated bowl and washlet), in my opinion, unless you want the auto flush function. If I'm building a new house, I would probably buy that, otherwise I think this model is just perfect."
"So after going to a Las Vegas hotel and experiencing a Bidet, I really wanted to get that bit of luxury for my home... Went through a few different models... first I bought the toto A2 from Costco on a pretty good deal... Seat warmth was nice, cleaning stream was a bit harsh at higher levels... dryer was ok... water was warm at first and then got cool.....heat warmer was very nice, also build quality was very nice! but wanted some other features so I tried the Bidet mate 2000 series.. which had a lot more features as the last light in the bowl.. the wash functions were nice but power was low, build quality was not that great, also cracking noises when sitting... top was flimsy ... also the heated seat was half warm... Luke warm... water would come on warm Luke warm and vary....

So decided to go up a model and get this one.... wow.. has almost everything I wanted... lots of power, adjustable nozzles, noticed everything was faster and build was amazing ... love the auto open and close... wow the seat can get hot! as warm as you want! Water was hot.. almost to hot on the highest setting, also no variable heated water it comes out hot and stays hot... remote control was nice... the swipe to press features take getting used to... oh man and the dryer blows hard and also almost to hot on the highest setting so good! Big thing to mention that this almost looks just like a regular toilet top.. super low profile for a bidet top..... looks clean and modern ! Big buy for me and worth the money !!"
"I have had this unit installed for 6 months, and I absolutely love it. The seat is warm in the winter, but I turn the heat off in the summer. The water temperature can be adjusted to my preference, the spray has multiple options, men and women options, pulsating, and the pressure is adjustable. A built in filter for odors, a night light both inside and outside the bowl that comes on when motion activated just like the seat cover will rise when approached. A separate button to make the seat rise for men to stand, and warm air to finish and dry. The extra cleanliness that this offers is fantastic, very little paper used, but a very clean feeling. I really like this seat, and I just don't see myself without one anymore. I installed one in a second home master bath that has a separate toilet room, but of course no electrical outlet. I installed the new electrical outlet behind the toilet to power the seat, and it was well worth it. These make clean up easy and complete, and the seat always closes on its own which keeps the wife happy too. Nice remote control, and easy mounting holder included. This is a keeper."
Works well and is comfortable!
I love everything about this bidet! Comfort and amenities out do similar brands. Very easy to install. I first used the Toto washlet in a suite at a Las Vegas hotel. I was sold that I needed a bidet. I compared many brands and decided to go with the highly rated Toto brand. Not disappointed!
"This toilet seat is a much cheaper way of getting a smart toilet that would cost upwards of $2000. It has all the bells and whistles -- auto-open lid, bowl pre-mist, heated seat, inline water heater for the sprayer, air dryer, self-cleaning/adjustable wand, etc. It has two programmable user profiles, so with a press of a button, you can switch to your own preferred spray position, pressure, and temperature. It even has a motion-activated night light. This list is not comprehensive, but it really does have all the features of smart toilets that cost several thousand dollars.

As you might expect, it does a great job of cleaning. As a man with hair, toilet paper doesn't always get the job done perfectly, but this does. If you've never used a bidet before, yes, it's a little uncomfortable (slightly less-so with warm water), but it's worth getting used to. For women, there's a feminine wash setting too. Installation is very easy; the hardest part is hanging the remote control on the wall. The only prerequisite is to have a 15 Amp GCFI outlet close by. For water, it comes with a T connector that connects to the tank inlet.

One thing I appreciate about this model that isn't advertised -- when you start the spray, it drains the stagnant water in the line before increasing to full pressure. This is to get rid of cold water in the line, so it's already warm when it hits its target.

Now for my complaints. The auto features are mostly motion-activated. My toilet is not enclosed, so any time someone enters the bathroom, if the features are enabled, the lid opens and the mister wets the bowl. I quickly deactivated these features because I don't want to wear out the lid motor or waste extra water. If you have a ""water closet,"" it shouldn't be an issue. Otherwise, there's a much cheaper version of this seat that has almost everything else that makes this bidet seat great. I wish I would have known that I could have saved hundreds of dollars and still gotten all the features I'm using."
"I have tried two other brands and have a bidet seat in all three of my bathrooms. One had a small leak and then stopped spraying all together. I came across this one when looking for a replacement. I was worried the seat opening would be a bit gimmicky but it reliably opens as soon as I head for the toilet and it's open about the time I start to reach for it out of habit. I'm now browsing for other brands with auto-open to add to my other bathrooms. Once you get used to the seat opening in one room you start to expect it in others and realize how burdensome it is to have to open your own toilet lid lol.

One review was complaining about the hose sticking out 90 degrees. On my unit the hose connection at the seat is on a swivel and you can't even see it.

Another review mentioned you had to press the air dryer button to stop the spraying. I realized later that the first button, a tiny square, is actually a stop button. It isn't labeled and I didn't realize initially it was even a button. This was also commented several times on his review, he needs to update it.

For the price I think the SWash 1000 is probably a better value, but it doesn't open automatically! As far as cleaning goes it works great but I actually prefer the sprayer on the SWash series. The Toto one has 2 nozzle type sprays, to me one is like either a sprinkler - too soft even on high or the other is a jet that actually is uncomfortable unless turned down to medium, but it's still maybe too pinpoint of a stream. Not sure how to describe it. Whereas my SWash seats are firm spraying (also adjustable), maybe a little larger spray but still small enough to feel like it's cleaning well.

Toto has a nicer looking remote and I also like the light. I wish the light inside the bowl would stay on like the nightlight it also has outside the seat. Overall it's a great seat and I don't regret getting it, but it would be perfect if the spray was more like the SWash sprayer.

UPDATE 5/12/21:
I actually now prefer the Toto sprayer, now that I'm used to it the SWash doesn't feel firm enough to get as good of a cleaning. But most importantly my second Brondell SWash has also started leaking and therefore I recommend staying away from Brondell."
"This bidet definitely lives up to its reputation! The instant warm water feature, auto-open and close, multiple spray options, and the heated seat are my favorite. The dryer gets hot but is just so-so. The only improvement I'd prefer is that the water spray for the anus was more forceful. After almost two years, the only feature to fade has been the air deodorizer. Also, the water that is supposed to spray as a pre-wash mostly drips instead of sprays."
"I have 3 Toto washlets, and the S550 is my favorite. I read many reviews and comparison charts, and they all make it sound like the K300 and S550 are nearly the same features, except for the auto-open seat/lid, remote, and front wide wash setting. Yes, on paper, that's true, but in practice, everything about the S550 is enhanced:

- The S550's default spray gets to a stronger level
- The S550's ""soft"" rear spray is wider than the K300's. It tends to clean faster while not feeling uncomfortable for sensitive people. But unfortunately it also splashes a bunch more water all over your rear side, making the drying time worse.
- The S550's dryer has a better pattern. The K300 feels like a jet of concentrated air that you have to shift around your rear to get even coverage. The S550's dryer feels more uniform and you can feel swirling air currents. Plus the 4/5 heat setting for me strikes that perfect balance of fast drying while not feeling like it's burning my rear, while the K300's 2/3 setting feels too cool while the 3/3 feels too hot.
- The ""bowl misting"" sprayer on the S550 sprays much more thoroughly and evenly compared to the K300, which sometimes incompletely coats the bowl and allows dirt to still cling especially near the front.
- Speaking of misting: The use of e-water is actually different between the models. On the K300, e-water is ONLY used to clean the wand. The bowl mister is only plain water. On the S550, plain water is used to pre-mist the bowl ""before you go"", but after you flush, it will spray down the bowl AND the wand with e-water. In practice I see a ton less of the ""red ring"" of bacteria/algae buildup in the toilet bowl that has the S550 on it.

To be honest, the K300 is a great value because it really does deliver 90% of the features that matter at maybe 60% of the price of the S550, and anything below the K300 feels like a huge downgrade due to the lack of unlimited hot water. But it's totally false to just say the S550 adds an auto-opening lid and night light. Everything else that the S550 does is slightly but noticeably better too. So if you're the kind of person who can stomach the price and would rather get the best, the S550 might be right for you."
A must have
"I purchased this toilet seat after my husband and I returned from our stay at The Royal Hawaiian in Waikiki. Aside from the beautiful view, the bathroom toilet was our favorite thing about our room! Having a warm toilet seat that opens and closes for you, and all the other features, well, it's like having a spa in your own bathroom. My life will never be the same! lol."
"Love the product, it works great and easy to install. Great discount compared to the full toilet yet has nearly all the features (missing auto-flush). The only gripe is that it has a substantial white connection hose that only goes to the left side which ruins the aesthetics if you have the toilet up to the right of a wall (to the left it isn’t noticeable). There would be space between the seat and the tank to hide the tube by going round the right hand side but they don’t make a connector - customer supports only solution was to suggest purchasing a Toto toilet that has the pass-thru hole and the different bidet seat.
If you have it on the left-hand-side of the room you won’t notice it."
"The listing from Toto said it was “New”…. Nope, opened the box, which was damaged, and sure enough, the interior packaging was also damaged. Other box had been opened prior to it being shipped to me. Some screws were also missing. Be careful when purchasing this product from Toto through Amazon. This is my second one purchased here. The first ones housing was broken and completely unusable."
"Also works with autoflush thu767, I could not get a straight answer anywhere. Finally called Toto, they said it worked. I installed it, works like a charm. You don’t need the toto s550e washlet plus version of this, though you do need a tank that’s compatable. My plumber picked up the cheapest toto available (Drake) for $250 and the internals are exactly the same as the much more expensive washlet plus version. All that’s different is there is a whole to better hide the wires but it you’re not getting a skirted toilet you’re gonna see the wires anyways and mostly after a day you won’t even notice.

So save yourself like $600. I’m writing this review for those who bought this and now have the mistaken belief they can’t have the autoflush, since it drove me crazy.

Altogether I have 2 toto s550e, one from here, and the integrated washlet plus unit which I regret purchasing. Did not realize my mistake until the washlet plus unit arrived and I saw the internals were the same."
"The Benz of butt-washers. Really excellent quality seat. However, installation into my Geberit wall carrier + Toto toilet was quite an adventure.

Most likely if you are connecting to any water source other than the included tee fitting, you will need the proprietary adapter Thp3141.

Works like a charm!"
"All in all this is probably the top of the line in bidets, where function and design is concerned.

Installation is a breeze, using it equally so. The functions are easy to configure and use, build quality is adequate for the price.

The only downside is a strong chemical smell from the device in the first days."
"I bought this during Covid, and it has been amazing. I’m glad I spent the extra money for the nicer one. I have tried other ones that are in the $200 to $500 range. They are not even close to the quality of this one. I did have to replace the remote once, and it was pretty expensive. Like $150. But, I love this thing so much that I can’t even give it four stars. Totally worth it."
"Our daughter, who is disabled, has problems with her bowels and cleaning herself after. She does not understand that too much toilet paper will plug the toilet. For years, we have told her wipe, then flush, wipe then flush, but to no avail, so we have dealt with plugged toilets all this time. Someone at my wife's work suggested we get a bidet. THE TOTO BIDET HAS BEEN A GAME CHANGER. The warm seat and the warm water are perfect. I wired a dedicated GFCI circuit back to the electrical panel, but since the ceiling below the toilet was not finished (it is the furnace room), that was not a problem. QUALITY IS EXCELLENT. THANK YOU TOTO."
Had someone else install but seemed pretty easy. We had an electrical socket put in next to toilet. Great features lots of automation very pleased
"I purchased the Toto S550E bidet several months ago. It was replacing a BioBidet BB2000. The Toto has better water pressure without a single violating stream that aims to penetrate you, just a nice steady wave of water. The dryer works great as well. I still do an insurance wipe when I'm done but it always comes out clean. This thing gets the target so clean you could eat off it, though my wife still refuses. It's a her problem though, not a Toto bidet problem, because it does it's part."
"I wrote a review saying the bidet quit working after 20 days, then I googled an article telling how to reboot the device the right way by holding the remote power button for 10 seconds. Now the device is back to life again and I am so happy. After only 20 days I am already addicted to the warm seat and everything else this device provided and can’t live without it. lol."
Premium quality. Works great. Highly recommend.
Straight up Green Clean...no toilet paper needed!
Ended up buying 2 of these. They are a Godsend. Can’t believe I waited this long to buy them. I mostly got this for my senior mother to assist her with cleaning after going to the bathroom. She loves it! We are all enjoying being squeaky clean after going to the bathroom now. Had contractors install and add the electrical outlets necessary.
"I hesitated on buying one of these since they aren't exactly cheap, but now I just wish I had bought one sooner. You will look forward to going to the bathroom once you have this."
"There are probably cheaper options that get the job done, but this is our second one: the first is still going strong after 4+ years without a single hitch and to say it is life-changing… well, it is. We are going from just one in the master bath to one for each toilet in the house."
"Be Cautious and Aware - we purchased 2 of these but they came from different Amazon sellers. The units from TOTO are first rate 5 star in quality and features. BUT - Amazon and the Seller listed them as NEW but both of them were previously sold, returned or otherwise opened - hence they were “Open Box” or repackaged items. With this particular unit the mounting hardware was used, the second unit had the vent filter installed but the vent cover plate was broken. FYI - After we provided the sale information - TOTO customer service (U.S. based) was quick and agreed to replace any broken parts."
needs to snap in tighter so the seat does not move off center of the stool.
"Oh, this thing makes life so much more comfortable. Now going to the bathroom and sitting on the toilet is a like going on vacation in paradise. Perfect engineering, everything fits just right. Unlimited warm water, good water pressure, heated seat, the smell is gone, amazing remote control. The best spent money!"
The heated toilet seat is amazing. The as needed hot water is everything I could have hoped for. It was super easy to install and does everything I could have hoped for.
"Toasty backside, effective water stream, warm drying. It's a new kind of luxury.

Install was a snap. Took my time and it was no more than 30 minutes."
"Without a doubt, the best quality bidet seats on the market are made by TOTO.
The inexpensive bidet seats are cheaply made and are an embarrassment to your bottom and your bathroom. Save your money if necessary to buy one later, if you can’t add this expense to your budget this month. You can bring it with you if you have to relocate too. TOTO is so worth it."
"We are still adjusting, but it's working great. We use a lot less TP now and feel cleaner.

I think if I could go back and purchase again, I would have gone with a lower priced model. We got the S550e, and while all the extra features are nice, I don't think it's worth the additional cost. The auto open seat is too sensitive, so the lid opens all the time when we walk by from a distance. I think they need to add a feature where you can adjust the sensitivity. I do know we can turn it off, but then what's the point of paying for that feature. The night light..ehh, could do without. I think those were the main differences in the S models.

overall, we are happy with washlet.

For those on the fence, maybe look at the C-series, which are much lower price points and do the same thing."
"I absolutely love the washlet itself and how it functions. I ended up really appreciating some of the secondary functions like the deodorizing and bowl misting more than expected. The restroom never smells now and the misting effectively runs a water curtain shielding the bowl from clinging residue upon use. I appreciate the narrow profile quite a bit as compared to the rest of the series as well. My only issue was the junction valve install, which seems to be a very consistent problem for most customers. I ended up needing to insert a brass, flat washer for the connection to the fill valve to keep it from leaking. Quite a bit of plumber's tape all around too. Beyond that, it'd be nice to have more control over how soon the washlet raises itself again after use, as well as a light sensor to regulate when the light comes on. Super nitpicky details though. Life-changing product. #poobetter"
It’s a high tech toilet seat it gives you a very clean feeling I’m always smiling after my visit to the toilet
"we got the Toto washlet for my very elderly mom who had a stroke and has limited mobility.
It has been tough to take care of her hygiene until Toto washlet arrival.
Now, after every toilet use, we let Toto bidet to take care of that.
The seat is heated, the water is warm, and the dryer takes the cake.

Only regret - we didn't get the auto-flush model, but since it is always the caregiver who operates the remove anyway, we can live with the manual flushing.
Kudos to Japanese people and to Toto!
Hotly recommended for healthy people as well"
Replaced the older version of this model ( we had it for 7 years) and it is great. I accidentally applied to much pressure while cleaning the old wand and therefore it no longer worked properly.
"This was an addition to the 2 Washlets we already had installed. Love this specific model that has the Full Featured remote. This remote has the button on top for men to open the lower seat, which is very convenient in contrast to reaching down and pulling up on the seat. All features are top of the line and fully functional. Love the unit"
"I’m converted! Very easy installation. You will need Vaseline or lotion to push the black rubber seat mounting bracket posts through the round holes in the toilet in front of the tank. Just wedge them in slowly with firm pressure with the screw still in the post. Works perfectly. The instructions show to wet the rubber posts with water. Yeah, water isn’t going to make the mission.

Otherwise, during my first test drive, I put it on rear cleansing with warm oscillating water on the highest pressure with LASER precision wand positioning. Butt thoroughly blow dried with nice warm air. Nice warm seat. NIRVANA. Definitely no longer using wet wipes/toilet paper. I’m not gonna lie, but I enjoyed it a little too much. =o)"

 I had a bidet many years ago and really appreciated it. So when I moved into my new house I had the TOTO bidet installed. Being 69 years old now I REALLY appreciate having this bidet. The seat has adjustable seat and water warmth that works perfectly. It also adjusts pressure and angle on the wash which is so handy. Even a night light as I stumble to the bathroom. It is definitely worth the money!"
"Retired Plumber, been using Toto Toilets and Bidet Seats for 20 plus years. Would not use any other Brand. When the Best Works, why would you ever change."
"Works great. I was worried about how sensitive the auto-open feature might be - didn't want it opening every time the door is opened. But it seems well tuned - just opens when you step in front of it. Fits well on a Toto Washlet+ toilet designed to hide the water and power lines. Deodorizer really seems to work. And perhaps it's the ionized water it uses to clean itself, but it even smells like a Japanese bathroom now! I wish the remote had a separate button for opening and closing the lid as well as the seat."
Great product overall! Needs a better bum dryer

 1st thing the install
The seat is very loose if you only use the “click in” feature that the manufacturer suggests.

I am a plumber and my seat must be tight, so I put four screws through the mount into the seat after “clicking it in” then I setup the mounting hardware and rubber plugs on the seat.”you won’t be able to tighten the seat in the normal easy way with a Phillips screwdriver” now you push the rubber plugs and the seat into place and you have to tighten the bolts that go through the rubber plugs from underneath. Doing this made the seat tight.

There is a pre mist feature but....oh wait it doesn’t work if you want to use the auto open feature that you paid extra for.

Next is the bowl light, the only time it comes on is when the bowl premist is activated. And I thought it would come on so you see the bowl when the lid opens.

The remote works well and the options for cleaning are great could use a lil more pressure."
All functions work well
Love this unit...it would be a 5 for almost anyone else. For 5 stars...additional open lid remote that could go on toilet lid (or elsewhere) to allow touchless opening of both lids. Also support integration to automated flush unit...such that I could trigger flush when second lid closes as a configurable option.
"This thing is the bomb diggity…. Clean, clean, clean. Cuts down on tp usage."
"WOW!! This product does everything it is supposed to.. It even salutes you when you come into the bathroom!!
I am totally pleased .. Be sure to order the 6"" extension attachment for the water supply or install a toilet water supply float with a brass flange is even sturdier and a better solution..the issue is you need to make metal to metal connections..
I adapted to my Kohler elongated toilet so that was a bit tricky... ENJOY!!!"
"Best bidet EVER! Toto has it all!! The seat auto opens. There are the regular washing features AND there is a dryer. The washlet pre-sprays the bowl and the wand cleans itself.
We installed the seat on a new Toto toilet one-piece base."
"I bought this for my wife and she loves it. I have to admit, I'm pretty impressed with it myself. Opens automatically when someone walks into the room and later on closes itself. Lights come on, pre spray starts up, etc. Feels good to sit on a warm seat. I bought a basic model before, but this one is about top of the line I think. I should of bought this one before."
Works great. It does get kind of noisy when self cleaning mode is on at night and seems to run hard at times. It did arrive damaged with a piece of plastic chipped off the corner. I super glued it back on. No major issue.
One of the best purchases of my life. We have the Toto two button toilet and this takes it to a whole other level.
This is a THRONE!!! Best purchase I’ve made in a long time. Never a tp shortage again!!! Super easy to install with the video.
"After living in Asia for 3 years, I had to get a Toto! It is the brand that most high-end hotels use. I smile every time I walk into the bathroom and my Toto lifts it's lid - eager to play! It works flawlessly and my TP bill has dropped considerably!"
This is our second bidet. The Toto has more options and was easier to install. We had second thoughts about buying it due to the price but we’re very happy we did. It’s great!
"***** (five stars!!). Next-level personal luxury. So incredibly civilized. Both my spouse and I feel fresher, cleaner, and awesomer. I’d you try the TOTO550e, you’ll thank yourself."
"This is our second purchase of this bidet seat in 10+ years. This is well constructed, solid and works as advertised. Easy to install. Our wall mounted remote still works 10+ years later."
"It's hard to review this, well, because of what it is. I will say this though. The first time you use it you will be speechless and think to yourself two things: ""What just happened to me"" and ""I have been living like a savage!!"" If you can afford it, or even if you can't, this is one thing you must purchase in your lifetime."
Attractively made product. Remote control is great. Does everything it is supposed to do with efficiency.
"I connected it to my Toto UltraMax II toilet. It was easy to install, but the seat had a very loose connection to toilet despite “clicking in.” and the water hose can’t be adjusted to make it not stick out. Seems so aftermarket and cheap. Another problem is that it makes noises all the time which is bothersome in the night. We could hear it despite the bathroom door being closed. Many of the automatic features needed to be turned off. The lid would open with any movement in the bathroom. That was annoying. Also manually opening the lid or seat, which is the obvious thing to do when you need to use it (not wait while you push the button), feels like you are opening a door meant only to be opened mechanically. Not smooth. On top of that the lid is this a really cheap thin thing. Not like the lid that comes with a regular Toto toilet. If this thing was $100 then I would say it was a nice novelty item. After all, a warm seat is worth $100, but this is thing is selling for a grand. Toto should stop selling it. It cheapens their brand."
Love the heated seat and warm water. Nice product leaving you nice and clean..
We visited Japan for three weeks and came home no longer thinking about it and began our lives doing it. Just wonderful and civilized. The give it the Wichmann affect.
It works great make sure you get a careful and clean alignment when putting the coupling in place don't cross-thread...
"Highly customizable features but quite expensive. Could be a few hundred dollars cheaper which would make it better value.
Some parts are quite difficult to clean."
"Our last Toto lasted 10+ years, so it seemed like a time to upgrade and this one was great! Flawless installation and operation so far."
Easy installation. Works very well. We love it.
I will be buying one for each toilet in our home.
"I purchased this item 4 months ago (May), and it stopped working a few days ago. It is getting power, but no functions are working. Who do I contact?"
"I really like all the functions the seat offers - but they have made the seat smaller than
my original purchased 10 years ago. That makes it very uncomfortable."
The golden standard. We have installed two of these and have been very pleased.
100%
Bowl stays clean quite operation
Excellent bidet all the bells.and whistles!
Love it
"Love it, esp. the new touch remote control."
"This is a replacement for an 8 year old Washlet with a broken hinge. It is a very nice unit, but the remote control isn't as easy to use as the older one. The automated lid is cute, but really not very useful, I worry that all of the features will make the unit less reliable, but only time will tell. The unit came as scheduled and arrived in good shape."
Awesome product
I paid over 1000.00 for this only to Break down on me in a month time. No more hot water and the seat cover does not come up on its own anymore. Bad Choice on me. Plus the price went up by 200 dollars. beware.
"disgusting used washlet sold as new, shameless!"
"After much investigation and research, I decided this was the one. Not the cheapest but not a second of regret for spending the money. Easy set up and flawless execution. With hard water in my area I did add a filter and Toto adapter to connect the filter. All that was easy install, also. You’ll wonder why you waited so long to buy one once you own it. Now all the toilet paper packages are used as a bumper in the garage to protect the car bumper from the wall. Do it!"
Once you use it you'll wonder how you did without it! Easy to use.
"The Amazon and Toto are denied the misleading answers about where is the seat made in? 8 months of use , it has a washer problem causing the water level goes low and Toto asks for the seal no. The label as the picture shows it is made in Malaysia.
I am lied when I use Amazon the search machine to looking for the product I want. Toto staff says some parts are made in Japan, but assembling the plate in Malaysia."
"I had originally purchased another, very highly rated, $700 bidet seat and, after using it for a few weeks, decided I didn't feel that it provided $700 worth of benefit to my life, so I uninstalled it, sanitized it, and returned it. I then purchased this Toto model to replace it.

Now I know what the fuss is all about.

This is a really nice product. Very customizable, the sprays can be programmed to hit exactly where you need them to hit, with just the right amount of pressure, and, most importantly...you come away very clean. Something the other product didn't always accomplish.

I do have to say I've become somewhat of a bathroom snob, though. If I'm out and have to go, I try to wait until I'm home in my own luxurious bathroom...this will spoil you.

As for the installation instructions: they could be better. I'm pretty handy and this wasn't the first bidet seat I'd installed, so I didn't really have problems, but the instructions are a combination of unclear diagrams and drawings and even more unclear text. Toto can afford to do better and I'm surprised they don't.

My one disappointment with almost all of the bidet seats (there are a few exceptions I've read about, but this is the case with this one and many other high end seats) is that you can't sit on the lid of the toilet. Come on, if you spend more than a grand on a toilet seat, you could at least make it sturdy enough for an adult to sit on when it's closed. That just seems unnecessarily cheap to me."
"The seat fits well on a Kohler elongated toilet. The classic works best with the style of toilet. It’s a blast having the seat auto open and close. I turned heated seat off cause I’m in Florida, but it’s toasty! The temperature control for water is great, position control is good and it’s overall operation is good. There are sometimes I’m so used to auto everything, it doesn’t flush though. So I forget to flush for a moment. lol
The only other gripe, which can. E turned off is the auto clean feature after 12 hours of non use it starts the self clean. Which can be a bother if it’s 3 am."
"Works as intended. Night light shines to right side, which is helpful in the dark. Endless hot water and auto open lid are features I didn’t think I would care about, but now appreciate. I previously owned what is now the Toto C200 and those two features in addition to the smaller thickness are worth the extra cost of the SW3054. I use this bidet at least once a day. I use the heated seat, auto open close, and night light feature every time I use the toilet—$1k well spent. Time to save up for one for the second bathroom…"
"I’ve just replaced my 15 year old washlet with a new one that has more features. Easy install and everything works perfectly! Loved my old one but it gave up the ghost. If I get another 15 years with this new one, I’ll be very happy."
"I can’t believe I waited so long to install this Toto! Opinions of others guided me toward a Toto, and I can’t say there is ANYTHING I don’t like about it! If you haven’t considered a bidet, you ought to, and make it a Toto! I love it!"
"This bidet is amazing- completely customizable for several users and all needs. Can be easily controlled by the wall mounted control for a variety of features including rear spray, front spray, dryer and intensity.

There are several different options for running the bidet- we prefer a timed mode so that the heated seat does not run all day. Instructions are clear and easy to use. There is seat auto up and down too for those who might not want to touch the toilet seat. We did not like the length of time it took for it to process these commands, so we shut it off.

The only complaint we have is the attachment to the toilet seat is flimsy- it may affect the longevity of this product."
Good product
"Before this, I had a simple non-electronic bidet that just attached to the water hose. This is like going from a Honda to a Ferrari. Installation was easy, just need to make sure you have an outlet next to it. We didn't but since we were getting our bathroom remodeled, it was easy to add. Our toilet is in a separate water closet so the auto open works great when we open the door. The design is sleek and modern, and it is very comfortable to use. Perhaps a little too comfortable...

The heated seats are a game changer and when we were testing out the energy saver function and sat on a cold seat, it was immediately noticeable how big a difference in made in our life. One thing we also noticed after using, there is no smell at all! We used to use Poo-Pourri or other similar products to mask the smell but since installing this, that hasn't been necessary at all due to the fan!

My only gripe with it is that you can't set the time saver function to a specific time frame, only to 6 or 9 hour intervals that you don't know when it will start. Another slight issue is that the toilet seems to drain a bit of power when starting up the fan so the lights flicker when you get seated. But it's honestly not a big deal for us.

While everyone is worried about toilet paper, this bidet has been a godsend. It's great that you can set up separate profiles and the fact that the bidet has both different power settings, heat settings and oscillating settings. 3 months in and it seems to be working great without any issues. Will update this review if that is short lived but as of now, I definitely recommend this product without a doubt."
"This is a very expensive seat/smart toilet lid but significantly cheaper than a smart toilet. I paid an electrician to install an outlet in the bathroom for this. The packaging was fabulous and directions were really easy for the most part. There was only one issue. After installation, the seat would move laterally a little bit. Not bad but the seat was not truly locked into position. I called customer service and they were quite helpful. They told me the slight lateral movement was normal as long as the seat locked into place. Despite that, this seat is AMAZING! The warm water, the pressure, the blower, the air purifier, lights, all of it are just fantastic. What is the winner is that heated seat! My wife keeps telling me to get out of the bathroom and do some work. That seat is so comfortable and then the heat is just the cherry on top. Its so difficult going and sitting on a regular toilet seat now. This one is a keeper!!"
"Installation is very easy. No need for ""expert installation."" A child could do it. You only need a screwdriver and a couple of wrenches. Adjustable wrenches or channel locks will do.

INSTALLATION TIP: the supply line between the shutoff valve and T-junction should be flexible and a few inches longer than what it would take to reach. This will enable you to loop the flexible supply line, which will cause minimal stress on the Toto-supplied T-junction. Otherwise, the T-junction will leak if the supply line pulls it in any direction.

Once installed, DO NOT USE before reading the instruction manual -- particularly the remote control operation. Too many lower ratings here blame the seat instead of their own misuse or misunderstanding of how it works. IMO, the remote operation is logical, but not necessarily intuitive. So, RTFM.

The operation of the seat is just fantastic. My only issue is I wish I had bought this before now. It is just fantastic! It is worth every penny! The automated lid/seat rise is a great feature. For men, raising the seat is too easy. And, women will never complain about the seat not being down when they need to use it in a hurry. The sensor to raise the lid is quite responsive. As soon as the toilet room door opens, the lid rises and the system pre-cleans the toilet.

Have I mentioned that this seat is fantastic?"
" The bidet is a bit expensive vs competitors, but in my opinion it is worth the extra amount. The bidet had a solid build quality and comes with tons of features. Some features include: customization of lid auto-lift feature, self cleaning, timing of seat warmer, water pressure, and nozzle position. You also get two user customization slots so you and a +1 can adjust the settings to your personal liking.

The dryer is also a beast on this bidet, by far the strongest I've experienced on a bidet. Have it go for 30-60 seconds and you'll be completely dry.

As you can see in my video, the bidet does light up, however this is temporary. There is no ability to keep the light on indefinitely, so if you're in search for a bidet with a bowl nightlight, this isn't for you.

Installation was simple, the manufacturer provides step by step instructions for you to follow.

The remote control is very easy to use. There are two sides to it. One side are your bidet controls such as front and rear stream control/modes as well as the dryer function. On the other side of the remote you have your bidet system settings such as lid lift programming, seat heater settings, and bowl/self-clean settings.

Overall this is a fantastic product and am very happy with my purchase."
"I did very much research and finally settled on the TOTO SW3056#01 S550E Electronic Bidet Toilet Seat. I love it so much that I would get the same bidet seat immediately if something happened to this one. It is so addictive that I hate to use a commode in a public location. It does everything it says it will do and it does it very well. Other reviews talk about the night light not being great…well, I guess it could be a little better…not a deal breaker for me and I don’t have to turn on the overhead light at night. This is one of the more expensive bidet seats and it has been worth every penny to me. I’ll just say one more thing. I don’t like to write reviews and never do; but, this thing is so great I felt compelled to write a review after 10 months of owning this seat."
"Listen up, folks, because I'm about to spill the beans (or should I say, spill the water?) on the Toto Washlet. This thing is a game-changer, a butt-cleaning revolution that will leave you wondering how you ever survived without it.

Now, let's get down to business. You know how sometimes you feel like your rear end could use a little extra TLC? Well, the Toto Washlet is here to save the day, or should I say, save your derriere. With its gentle, cleansing spray, it takes bathroom hygiene to a whole new level. Trust me when I say that my backside has never felt cleaner.

But wait, there's more! This technological marvel is packed with features that will blow your mind. It's got adjustable water temperature, pressure, and even different spray patterns. Who knew that choosing how your nether regions get cleaned could become such a sophisticated decision? It's like a day at the spa, but for your bottom.

The Toto Washlet doesn't just clean your rear; it pampers it. It's like having a personal assistant devoted to your hygiene needs. I half-expect it to start playing some relaxing music while I'm on the throne, or maybe offer me a complimentary foot massage. Okay, maybe that's a bit much, but you get the idea.

Now, I know what you're thinking. ""Do I really need a toilet seat that sprays water at my behind?"" And the answer is a resounding YES! Once you experience the luxurious cleanliness of a bidet-like wash, you'll wonder how you ever managed with just plain old toilet paper. It's a game-changer, my friends, a rear-end revelation.

But here's a word of caution: once you go Washlet, you never go back. I find myself longing for that refreshing spray even when I'm not at home. I catch myself contemplating installing one in every bathroom I encounter, like some sort of washroom vigilante. But alas, I must learn to share the joy and let others discover the wonders of the Toto Washlet for themselves.

So, if you're ready to take your bathroom experience to a whole new level, join the clean booty revolution and get yourself a Toto Washlet. Your rear end will thank you, and you'll never look at your bathroom visits the same way again. Prepare to be amazed, my friends, because cleanliness has never been so captivating."
"We spent a lot of time researching bidets. Finally we settled on this on even though it was VERY EXPENSIVE over other brands. It met all of our wants on the check list. I even asked several customers if it had a night light and was told yes it has a night light. Guess I should have made it extremely clearer with my question about the night light. We had another bidet and it truly had a night bowl light. When the lights went out the bowl lit up a beautiful blue in color which was very helpful for small children and elderly that need a little more guidance in the night. However, the one we had did not have remote which we really like and it did not have the front and rear washer. Why have one without both... right?

Based on the answers and the description about the night light we selected this model even though it was over the top expensive. We like it even though it DOES NOT have a night time bowl light. I called TOTO and they explained that the night light is about a 2 second flash of a light when it detects movement and that is it... NO NIGHT TIME LIGHT UP BOWL LIGHT. So if you are looking for that light up bowl at night this is not the one that does that. So, we added a night light where it plugs in near the floor and that is the light that guides you NOT that 2 second worthless flash. Sorry but 2 seconds means nothing especially when the flash is directed at a wall and hard to see. For this amount of money there should be a real bowl light in my thinking but I am not a designer so what do I know? I just know there are less expensive models with a real night time bowl light!

We like the automatic lid raising and lowering even though it seems to be getting slower and we have only had this about a month. Hoping it does not get any slower at raising or we will shut that part off.

The misting is questionable on just how well that works... not convinced it does much at all.

The remote is wonderful and so much better than the remotes that are on the side ... you can't hardly read them. We love the remote idea and it is SUPER easy to use. We did not it mount to the wall. There are options on both sides of the remote so we thought mounting it to the wall was not a realistic option. We have a small cart on wheels with drawers and it works great by the toilet and the remote is right there handy on top of the cart in plain view making it easier to use options on both sides.

It is a sleek design and we are happy with it. Would we buy another one? No, not at this price when it really does not have a bowl light which was a big deal for us. We wish we had shopped around a little more and found a better price. A day or so after we bought this one we saw the same exact model for over $200 less but the company we ordered thru did not budge on any discount. We were tired after such a long remodel job on our bathroom that we just wanted to get back to normal living so we just bit the bullet and avoided the hassle of having to PAY to return it and purchase the one at a better price.

We have one more bathroom to go and even though we do like this bidet we won't pay this price again we will look for another company to purchase thru if we choose this same model. Not saying anything negative about this company at all. They posted their price and we bought it so a deal is a deal. We kept it and keeping our fingers crossed that it stands up to time and we won't regret spending so much on one that wound up not being what we really wanted and what we thought we were buying."
Only thing I had to change was the automatic seat lift. Our bathroom is next to a highly traveled area and it would open every time someone just walked by the bathroom. Works great.
"We recently decided to enter the world of bidet's and are very glad we did. I ordered the SW3056 S550E and install was a breeze. Adding an outlet was the harder part but not too bad as I had a conveniently located outlet to tap off of. We love how it works and are very pleased with the Toto Washlet (not our first Toto product), love the brand. The second night we started hearing it open and run a cleaning cycle several times during the evening. I returned that one and bought a replacement, and it's doing the same thing. I have all the ""Auto"" features enabled but no one is in the bathroom when it does this. Not sure if it's a ""feature"" or if the sensor just doesn't play well in the dark."
"First off... A rating for ""Softness?"" WTF?

Okay people... I had a WHOLE review written up in my head where I played Captain Kirk and acted out several episodes of wiping out the Klingons! But then I thought... These people don't want a laugh... They want an honest review... So here goes.

I have been using my Toto bidet seat now for a few months now. It installs easily and the hardest part is wiring the outlet needed for it to work. I do all my own work and do it to code. I needed to run a wire up the outside wall to where my toilet was and then cut through wainscoting and drywall to install the outlet. Since I wanted the outlet out of the way... That meant a contorted position for a few hours. So... That took the longest part of the install. Since most of you will install this and run it off an extension cord until you have an electrician install an outlet... I'll go straight to the install.

First off you will remove your old seat. CLEAN very well and install the new seat per directions! It's really THAT easy! Your kid could do it! A few tips on plumbing though and this is generic advice. NEVER USE PIPE DOPE on ANYTHING! If you MUST, and ONLY where called for, use teflon tape... But is for metal/metal or plastic/metal threads ONLY! Most plumbing these days (when it comes to hooking something up) is either a brass crush washer or a rubber seal. Teflon is NOT used there as the water should never make it to the threads! If your threads are holding back the water... You have done something wrong! So... After countless bathroom redos... Here's the straight dope! Get a wax toilet ring and have it handy! I've had the same one for 20 years. When you are putting the assembly together you can apply just a thin coating of wax. This helps the seals seat whether rubber or brass. If you are removing your tank... Apply it to the tank seal and the rubber washers (both sides) that hold the tank down. In 25 years I have NEVER had a leak doing it this way!

Now... Let's move on! The remote on this was fairly intuitive. Sitting on the toilet you can tell what does what and you might decide you don't need to read the manual. You would be wrong! (as I was!) Men don't read the directions... right? Anyway... I was pretty upset with the lack of pressure until I read the manual on how to increase it. Um... Press the spray function TWICE! That you will get you percolated!

The seat is INSTANT warm... So much so I thought I had diarrhea! Turn that sh*t OFF! Maybe come winter but definitely NOT summer. I turned the warm water spray to just under high as I did the blower. The spray CAN get too hot and the blower will go up hot enough to singe your butt hairs off! Seriously! The cool thing is... You can set up all this as User1 and program what you like. All the temps and positions of the spray nozzles. You need to realize that you MUST move around on the seat a little and almost try to let the water into your body (It won't but it might feel like it!) in order to remove what's there. Generally I go for about a 2 minute spray and a 1 minute dry... But you are till going to give at least 1 wipe to make sure you are dry and clean.

I mounted my remote on the wall right beside the seat and I freaking LOVE this machine! If it stays working as it is, I would call this one of my favorite investments! And that is how I view it... an investment into myself! Just like having a good bed to sleep in!

Now... Let's get to another side I have never seen mentioned. This setup can be a little sexual in certain ways. I mean... Sitting down and having the spray hit certain areas can totally change your mood and/or train of thought! You might sit down thinking about how you are going to tackle the project you just left in the basement... Next thing you know you're thinking about jumping someone's bones! This thing can be arousing I find. Maybe it is just me but I can't imagine that is the case. Not to sound sexist... But if I was a woman I would never leave the seat and I would have my meals brought to me! And... If you have already installed this seat and haven't thought of that... You most certainly will now... won't you? It's okay... You can say it!

In closing I will say that cleanliness results from time being sprayed, directions being sprayed and viscosity of poop. So... This tool works as it should... If you work it as you should!"
Top quality. Was a skeptic at first and now I love it. Worth the money. Remeber. You need a GFI outlet next to your toilet!
"We've tried other bidets and honestly this one is superior. We've had it for half a year and no issues so far, I was not really impressed with bidets before this one and did not want to spend the money on it. My husband got it for us and now I'm a convert."
"The Toto Washlet S550e has been a great addition to my bathroom. While it comes with a high price tag, I consider it a necessary and worthwhile investment. It fits perfectly with our toilet, enhancing both comfort and functionality. We will always have one and will remain a staple in our bathroom routine. Overall, a positive and enduring experience."
"This was my first bidet I've owned. After discussing what to get with several store reps and doing my own research I settled on the TOTO SW3056 S550E. I was also able to get it for considerably less on Amazon than in any store that was selling this model. I've never been so excited to go to the bathroom than I was when this first was installed. I can't speak to the physical install, as the plumber did that when installing the toilet during our renovation project, but I can speak to the ease of install of the remote and the clairity of instructions when learning how to use the bidet the first time. If you've never owned one I HIGHLY recommend reading through the instructions to get the most out of what this provides. The instructions are very clear and you also will learn how to keep this clean when cleaning your toilet and how to maintain the wand and filter for the air filtering system without damaging it. You will also learn what all the symbols mean on the bidet itself, what the lights are indicating, and remote operation. Thinking back on it, I laugh at how I ended up having to set my personal settings which involved me sitting on the toilet and making manual adjustments to wand position, water and dryer tempurature, as well as spray strength using the remote. Once everything is set, you just do your business, then touch the button shaped like a butt, swipe the personal preference you set (1 or 2) and you're good to go. I will never go back to using toilet paper again. I don't think I can make up the cost of this thing in toilet paper purchases, since we still have kids that will be using that, but I'm a very happy camper so far with this product. My only gripes I have(and they're minor) would be the fact that there's a lot of plastic on this which I worry about from a durability standpoint and the possibly a yellowing of the white finish which seems to happen with all plastics over time. Overall I'd give this a recommendation."
"Play Video
 Nothing compares to a heated toilet seat. Smiles everyone. It lights your way at night. Plus raises and lowers seat on its own 👍🏽.
The front cleansing wand should be longer but that could be a personal issue.
I watched the installation video. I installed the toilet seat on my existing Toto base. Needed to drill a hole through the wall to reach an electrical outlet in the next room just large enough for wire plug-in. I used a switch plate cover to cover the hole in the wall. Cut a slit and bend switch plate cover just enough to slide electric wire.
Remote is mounted on wall . Small table accessorized is to hide the plumbing tube."
"Update 2/26/2023:
I’m revising my original rating to 4 stars for this product after I was able to install and use it. After wracking my brain on how to get around the problem with the rubber bushing by cutting off the flat top rubber washer off and inserting the bushing from the bottom of the hole and pushing it UP the toilet bowl seat holes. I’m not recommending that step to my one else, it just worked for me. After that everything installed easily and I was able to use the product and I couldn’t be happier with how it works. In fact, I removed the other bidets and bought 2 more new ones to put on the other toilets.

The seat is more comfortable than my older bio bidets because of the lower seat profile. I love the auto open close lid, less touches and more hygienic that way. The water, air temps are easily adjusted to my liking and the water pressure works the same as my previous bidets. So more pluses than negatives for me. I can’t give it a 5 stars since I still dislike the rubber bushing design. Other comparable bidets have easier ways of attaching the seat and had no issues with the seat moving, so not sure why Toto thought their rubber bushing design is better…

+==============
Fancy me buying top of the line Toto for the first time. Had bidets before and no issue installing them. Toto for some reason is not just fancy with the features but also with providing a rubber bushing to install in tight toilet seat holes for what they say is a tight fit needed so seat won’t move. Understandable, but the design is not meant to make installation easy. Tried lubricating with water, grease, etc. tried to use Dremel to widen the hole in the toilet so the rubber bushing will fit. Nope, nope, nope. Had blisters on my fingers trying to twist and twist the rubber bushing into the hole for the toilet seat to no success. Enough. I’ll bite the bullet and buy a different bidet that is not Toto. Buyer beware."
"I ordered my 550E during the pandemic and man, we were slobs before this thing! I'm writing this review almost 3 years after my initial purchase because the unit went on the fritz and died. I called Toto USA support and a good ole boy from right here in the USA answered the phone. $175 dollar flat fee (all parts included) including shipping for them to fix it and send it back. Very reasonable price and about 10 days turnaround start to finish. I ordered some dude wipes in the mean time but nothing can compare to the toto. Toto earned my repeat business and advocacy!"
"It has been 2 years and 7 months since installation. Although it looked straightforward, the same handyman that put in the necessary electric outlet also installed the bidet for us. It has worked flawlessly and my wife loves it (she has some disabilities). A few weeks ago some features stopped working altogether (possibly due to power interruption during storm). I was able to restore all functionalities after playing with the remote for some time. I also saw a YouTube video showing how you could push a couple of the remote buttons simultaneously and all lights in it began to blink together. After that everything began to work. So I will assume the failure was just a hiccup, and hope that it will be bringing comfort to us for years to come."
"Writing a review to clarify that it DOES have a night light. That was a big feature for me. Some other reviewer said it doesn't have a night light or that it's limited, and that's only somewhat true depending on the mode you have it set to. Looking at the guide there's both a ""soft light"" and a ""bowl light"". The soft light points away from the unit and the bowl light is inside the toilet. If you have the energy saver mode on it does limit the time of the light on to 5 seconds. If you don't have energy saver on the manual says it will stay on for 90 seconds."
"I should start this review off by mentioning that I have irritable bowel syndrome, so this thing probably impacts my life a lot more than someone who has normal bowel movements. I have been considering getting a bidet for many years, and for some reason I never pulled the trigger. After experiencing the toto washlet magic, I find myself regretting the hesitation. I could have avoided all of the discomfort caused by toilet paper and/or wet wipes if I I had gotten a bidet sooner. There are certainly other bidets on the market, aside from the Toto washlets, but they aren't as good. You might be wondering why they're so expensive, and maybe part of me is too, but all I can say is that's it's worth the price. Consider the price of toilet paper, wet wipes, and misery.. financially and environmentally. All of that paper waste is just awful, so if you want to reduce how much waste you output, a bidet is a smart choice.

I had been experiencing a lot of trouble due to my IBS, it even caused me to be late to class a few times, but with a bidet like this, I never would have had any issues. I never want to deal with trouble like that again, so that's why I decided to get the best of the best. This thing is the bee's knees. You could actually go to the restroom without washing your hands with it, because you never touch anything unsanitary. I walk up to the toilet, it detects me, opens the lid, and then starts misting the bowl of the toilet. I drop trou, sit down, and grab the remote. Then I have all kinds of options like cleanse, drying, variables on the cleansing process such as oscillating (back and forth motion), pulsating, or both at the same time, adjusting the temperature of the water, dryer, or seat. Oh yeah, the seat is heated. Of course, it's summer in Georgia right now, so I have it turned off. This thing also deodorizes the air, so your **** won't even stink. It's magic. What I'm trying to say is that if there was ever a feature that you wanted a bidet to have, this thing has it, and more.

Not much more to say, other than that I love it!

Here are some tips for installation:

I just installed my Toto s550e yesterday, as someone with no experience with that kind of thing. It took me quite a while, but only because of the location of my toilet in the bathroom. My toilet is against the wall in a corner, and the side that I needed access to was closest to the wall. There are a few things to note when installing this thing:

Make sure that you purchase a roll of plumber's tape. You need to roll it around the male thread that protrudes from the bottom of the toilet tank, and be liberal in your application. Just make sure that it's fairly taut. Then you want to do the same thing to the male thread on the adapter piece that comes in the box with the washlet. This one is much easier to get right, because you don't have to be a contortionist to reach it. Once you've done that, you can attach it all... make sure not to cross threads (misalign) and you should be good. Once you hook it all up, check for leaks. In my experience, they always came from the connection between the adapter and the male thread under the toilet tank. If you don't find any leaks there, then you can move on to plugging in the washlet and living large.

Hope that helps."
"I was finally able to travel (before Covid, I went at least once a year) from my home in the US to Switzerland to visit my Swiss family. In my son's new apartment, he inherited a Geberit bidet seat - with similar functions to this Toto Washlet. Having never used such a device before, I was tremendously impressed. Now, being a thoroughly 'seasoned citizen', retaining some dignity and hygiene are increasingly important to me.

For maybe 10 years, I have been using a hand bidet bottle thinking I was saving a lot of money. However, using that incurred costs of heating the bathroom before use (via an app/smart wall plug) and the inconvenience of running the hot water tap for about 2 full minutes to get water of a comfortable warm temperature. This technique also limited the quantity of wash water available - unless I wanted to get up and refill it. This did work tolerably well.

However, the experience with my son's device left no doubt it was time to get one. I am extremely pleased with my three 2-piece Toto toilets. They are great. So, I decided Toto was the brand for me. The Washlet arrived in 2 days and took me less than an hour to install, using a heavy-duty extension cord from a ground-fault plug in the bathroom (I am not yet sure in which bathroom the device will permanently live, so did not immediately have an electrician install a new plug). Installation was very easy.

The Toto Washlet exceeded my expectations! Unlike my son's, it has infinite hot water (adjustable temp) and several adjustments as to position and pulsation of the flow. The dryer function is far better than the Geberit; no comparison, really. The adjustable heated seat obviates the need for me to pre-heat the bathroom. Yes, this is a bit of a luxury, but one which I believe measurably improves the quality of my old-age life. I wish I had bought it 10 years ago."
All great features however wish there was a button on the remote to only open/shut the lid not the seat.
"I am a bona fide convert. For many years we considered getting one of these washlets for our master bath water closet but i was worried it meant tearing up the tile along our walls. when i learned our electrician could do it relatively easily and without any mess, we dove in. yes there are other brands that are cheaper, especially via costco, but let's face it, toto is the gold standard. if you're gonna get an appliance to rinse and dry your bottom, why have even a glimpse of compromise, you may as well get the best, right? we installed it easily in about 20 minutes. i watched all of the videos online, even the one that teaches you how to hide the water connection so it retains a sleek look. we had the outlet placed behind the toilet on the right so the water and the electrical connections are both easily hidden.

the most time consuming thing about this product is reading the operator's manual...it's got quite a bit of information, but after reading it carefully and testing things out, you're good to go. the remote is pretty intuitive, and once you choose the settings on the back of the remote, you really don't need to go back to it very often. we mounted the remote at a seated, eye level just to the right of the toilet which is extremely ergonomic. my only gripe, which sounds ridiculous when i say it out loud, is that i wish the remote had a bit of a backlight cuz when i use the water closet at night, i frequently don't turn on the light, and the remote is completely dark so i have to use it by memory. poor me.

the actual workings of the washlet are wonderful. very adjustable and consistent. my husband's favorite function is the button for the automatic open and closing of the lid and seat. it has become a hands free experience for him! now, since we have a water closet, the automatic open and close function is very practical for us since it is removed from foot traffic so to speak, but if your toilet is central in your bathroom, this function may become a nuisance, as it has for a friend of mine who had to deactivate the auto open/close.

bottom line, if you can afford it, get itand you're guaranteed to love it."
"We bought a Toto bidet when our toilet died. I have lived with C.DIff a nasty intestinal infection for 2 1/2 years. I did not die from it or end up in the hospital which happens to most longtime sufferers. I am sure the bidet had a lot to do with it. We loved it so much that we bought this seat for my mother & sister. My sister is in a wheelchair and it is difficult for her to shower or take a bath by herself. Her husband travels at least 4 days a week for work. She is loving the fact that she can feel clean below no matter what.
We love the heated seat & water that you can adjust temperature on. These are the best!"
"Update: I realized that my problems below were caused by using an outlet switched on by presence detection, fact I didn’t even realize.
——-
I previously had an older version of the non-automatic model and was pretty happy with it.
Setting up another bathroom, I decided to pay extra for the auto-seat and I wish I didn't.
1) Lid auto-raise was erratic. A lot of the time it would ignore me. I searched online and found some similar complaints linked to the fluorescent lights. Gave up and disabled auto-raise.
2) Button-triggered raise of the seat is delayed by 30 seconds. So I enter to pee, wanting to raise the seat and pressing the button does nothing until the thing wakes up during those 30 seconds, then it works. Raising the seat by hand creates that mechanical gear grinding noise that makes me think I am breaking it, so I don't like doing that. So it's either that, or waiting patiently. I was mostly waiting and I hate it. Searching the web for at least an hour did not help me.
3) The heated seat function takes much longer than 30 seconds to wake up. I think my previous model did it either full-time or was quick enough for me not to notice.
4) Installing on a generic bowl was a breeze. Installing on a fancy TOTO bowl took me hours and two trips to hardware store for adapters and extenders and asking for help from a smaller-handed person as my hands did not fit the cavity on the the bowl's bottom where the water was fed. This has nothing to do with the bidet, really, but I am pissed at TOTO as I expected better compatibility after overpaying for TOTO compared to some other brands.

The actual bidet functions work fine."
"We just recently traveled to Tokyo Japan. One of the most interesting aspects of our travel was the overarching use of Toto washlets in almost EVERY single toilet we came across. We couldn't believe how normal it was to have this type of accessory on your toilet regardless of public or private. The seats are heated, some of them came with ambient noise makers, some came with extra wash/dry features. Regardless, every single trip to the restroom was AWESOME, as it should be. So, needless to say as soon as we returned home we started our search for our own. We ultimately decided on the S550e's. Why?, well, the feature set is amazing and this particular seller offered an excellent price over all other competitors we searched. Now do keep in mind you will need a GFCI outlet (Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter) think the ugly outlets in your kitchen and baths. The GFCI outlet(s) will need to be installed around the immediate area of your toilet because the cord for the Washlet is about 3.9inches. We had both our toilet areas installed by a professional electrician for a total additional cost of $330.00. The installation part is really easy; I was able to install start to finish in less than 15 minutes. The remote is super easy to program, just make certain you IMMEDIATELY tell it which language you prefer or things could be hard. Once we had the units up and running we have been so happy. Again, each trip to the restroom is enjoyable and calming. We also took note that our toilet paper use has crashed. We will probably only have to buy toilet paper a couple of times per YEAR because of these. Additionally, cleaning the bowl frequency has been cut as well along with the associated chemicals because the Washlet uses E+water technology that turns normal water into a form of cleaning solution naturally. Lastly, now when one of us is having one of those ""off"" days the Washlet's odor removal technology saves the days. I just cannot say enough good things about this unit currently. I will revisit an updated review in one years time (one year is all the warranty you get from Toto), but from what I gather these things typically last for a really long time."
"My husband and I spend a lot of time in Japan and had become accustomed (or rather spoiled?) by Toto Washlet toilets there. While it seems insane to spend almost $900 on a toilet seat (and even more hilarious to spend time writing a review for it as well), it genuinely improves your quality of life - and is better for the environment (and your wallet, if you spend a lot of money on toilet paper).

We purchased this particular model because we liked the idea of the auto-open toilet as well as the EWATER+ system, which really does help the toilet stay cleaner - particularly if you're using a low flow type toilet. The only downside to the auto-open feature is that our Bengal cat figured out how to operate it, too - and tries to climb inside the toilet to play in the water, so if you have curious cats (or smart dogs who like to drink from the toilet) - you may want to disable the feature *using the remote) or keep your bathroom door closed.

The spray is adjustable, both in heat and pressure, and while it doesn't compare to Toto's Neorest line (which we've had the pleasure of experiencing in upscale hotels in Japan and Indonesia), it is pretty targeted and strong enough to clean well. The drying feature isn't particularly strong (you'll want a couple of sheets of toilet paper to dry yourself, unless you plan on hanging out on the warm seat and reading for a while). I don't claim to understand how the deodorizer feature works, but it does - I can enter the bathroom directly after my husband without any smell whatsoever - that magic feature alone is probably worth the price!

Installation was simple and required ordinary tools you'll have on hand. My husband and I installed it in less than an hour with ease, and we're not particularly experienced with plumbing. We've been using it for about three months now with no issues.

Highly recommended, and definitely worth the investment. I'm hoping our next toilet purchase will be from the Neorest line, but in the meantime this Washlet makes every trip to the bathroom a little more comfortable."
"I cannot recommend this bidet. It is easy to install and I believe well made but the functional control is a complete failure. The most annoying part is that the approach sensor cannot be controlled. The cover lifts and bowl auto wash starts anytime anyone walks into room. You can control the lid not to raise but the auto wash sill occurs. And then when set to no auto lift, then it will not auto close. The bowl wash should not occur unless the lid is opened. That would solve that issue. And how hard is it to program the lid to not auto lift but yet still be able to auto close. The other really annoying thing is that the bowl light turns on while the auto wash is occuring and then turns off after two seconds. Really guys???? The purpose of the bowl light is for us guys to know where to point during our night use. At least program the bowl light to say on when the seat is up. And the last thing is put a back light on the remote so that you can see what you a programming and it would also be useful to have the functions on the front side of the remote so one can see what options to select when using at night so that you don't have to turn on the bright room lights. The cost of this bidet is too high for such poor programing.
On the positive side and why i gave it a second star. The wash features are well designed and do a great job cleaning your underside. The heated seat is comfortable and the heated water and air dryer are great. Fix you programming and this might be a great solution. But for now, I would not recommend this to anyone and I am sorry that i purchased this model for what is costs."
"One simple observation:

In Japan, the toilet is almost always in a separate room (with a door) from the sink / shower / tub area.

Implications if your toilet is in a room that you might enter for other reasons:

1. You probably will want to disable the auto-open to avoid opening every time you walk in the room for other purposes.

2. You also might want to disable auto bowl clean. Even if the lid does not open every time you walk in, it will dispense water around the bowl when you walk by. (In my bathroom, it will spray when I walk in to brush my teeth, then spray again when I leave the bathroom - even if the lid is not set to auto open. )

3. Unlike japanese models, the only control for opening is *seat* up and down. There is no lid-only button. If they are both down, yes, you can open both -wait - and then press the button again to lower the seat.

4. There is no way to turn on auto close without auto open.

The frustrating part for me is that these all could be fixed in logic - the device is capable of closing and opening the lid, but the motion sensor is the only way that motor is independently accessed. You could make up for a lack of independent buttons for the lid/seat with long/short press.

Given what I know now, I could have bought a step or two down in the series and owned a washlet that was just as functional for my american style bathroom."
"Other than having to install an electrical outlet, this was pretty easy to install. It looks sleek and modern, fits the toilet nicely, and is very comfortable to sit on. I really like all of the cleaning and deodorizing features. After playing with the remote and settings, I have it just about right. However, the first time I used it I gave myself a mini enema, not realizing how strong the stream would be. That was interesting :) I turned it down.
Now for the things that could be better. The night light is really way too bright, so I turned it off. It would be nice if it had a dimming feature. The bowl light only stays lit for a few seconds, which is really stupid, considering how useful that would be for the men using it. I turned that off too. The dryer, while a nice feature, is way too soft to really do any sort of drying, but it does help a little, which in turn does cut down on TP use, so I do use it. It just takes a long time. The directions say to use a damp cloth to clean, but my germophobe self needs a bit more than that, so I use Clorox wipes and then wipe after with a damp cloth. Hopefully I won't ruin anything doing that.
I think for an almost thousand dollar toilet seat it could be a bit more functional. That being said, I am really happy I got it, and I do appreciate the feeling of cleanliness after going."
This is a very good product with the exception of the dryer. You can sit with the dryer on for quite a while and still not dry your butt. If I had to do all over again I’d get the step down without a dryer or a lid that opens and closes by itself. Those features are just not worth it.
"Last year when traveling in Japan, our hotels had similar Toto toilets, and we simply loved them. A week ago we finally decided to add this top model Toto washlet to our toilet and we are very happy.
Before receiving the unit I had some doubt on the minimum measurements listed online, as the space between the toilet's back and the holes to fix the Toto seat was actually smaller than the minimum listed. This turned out not to be an issue, as the fixing plate, coming with the Toto, can be shifted.
Installation was easy and took me less than 30 minutes, following the printed instructions. I knew in advance that I needed an extension cord for the electrical power and I was able to do a decent job to hide that extension cord. I also added a ON/OFF switch (https://smile.amazon.com/s?k=GE+Grounded+Outlet+Power+Switch%2C+On+Off+Outlet+Switch%2C+3+Prong%2C+Plug+in+Switch%2C+Outlet+Adapter%2C+Easy+to+Install%2C+For+Indoor+Lights+and+Small+Appliances%2C+Energy+Saving%2C+UL+Listed%2C+White%2C+25511&ref=nb_sb_noss) . to the extension cable in order to switch off the washlet when cleaning it. If not, as the lid opens when approaching the unit and starts to clean the bowl, it could be cumbersome to clean it.
It took me a couple of days to fully understand all the features and how to program them on the back of the remote, and my wife still does not make full use of the available features. Our conclusion is that we love it and we are happy to have chosen the top model.
The only negative that I have not yet figured out is that frequently when sitting down, and when the bowl is being cleaned, water sprayed outside in front the toilet. Is it because of a wrong setting, because I don't sit the right way ????
I checked the water inflow connections but very clearly there is no leak at that end.
If you can afford this Toto washlet, then go for it. You won't regret it.
----------
A few weeks later now, and I added the fifth star. The initial issue of water coming out from the device has stopped and I assume that I was not sitting on it right. In fact for two weeks I had stomach problems and I could not be happier that I had the Toto toilet seat. If you can afford it, go for this top model. All the bells and whistles are worth it."
"I have been eye balling a bidet for years, and now I feel like an idiot for not buying one sooner. This thing is amazing. I never really realized how dirty you still were after going to the bathroom until I bought this thing. Only complaint is sometimes the remote isn't real responsive. But overall I love this thing."
"My Granddaughter told me about these washlets and bought one for herself and her Mom. Which then sent me on the search for “the best” one. Finally deciding on the Toto S550E in 10/2021.
It is everything I needed. My dear, electrical engineer husband wired it in and we’ve enjoyed it now for almost two years.
I’m glad I didn’t get the self flushing. Don’t want to waste water or have it flush until ready.
Too many people have the wrong impression on Electronic Bidet Toilet Seats but once used will truly appreciate the cleanliness, gentleness, less waste of toilet paper and cleaning aids. One of the best gifts to help clean our bodies now and into our later years."
"Bought this for my wife for her birthday. Friends couldn't believe I thought a toilet seat was an appropriate gift, but she raves about it. Tells me that she actually looks forward to getting home from trips now just because she gets to use her toilet again. She also says that the front cleaning feature makes her ""lady time"" so much more pleasant."
"I was a little leery of paying that much but it is so worth it. Best thing ever. Hardest part was getting power to the area. If you've never had a bidet seat before, get this one. Just do it."
"The bidet seat is one of my all time best buys, really. The seat opens when I approach it, lights up the bowl, and turns on a night light on the side of the seat, sprays the conditioned water to rinse the bowl, is warm when I sit, and after my business, it rinses my bottom with warm water, pulsating, spray, and follows up with a warm air dryer. The odor filter comes on and it actually works well, eliminating smells dramatically. When finished, the seat cover closes. I liked the item so much that I purchased another one for a second home, and gifted a less expensive model to a grown child. I am impressed with how well this works for cleaning and making me feel clean, reducing the use of paper, and keeping the toilet bowl cleaner. A clean hiny is a wonderful thing, and my spouse loves it too. I would highly recommend the seat. We have a dedicated toilet room inside the bathroom, which I had to install a special electrical receptacle to power the seat, it was worth the trouble. Love it, and don't plan on going back to the old way ever again."
"I am editing my initial review below. I initially received the product with a defective cleaning wand. Read my experience with customer support below, it wasn’t good or helpful.

I took advantage of “Amazon’s generous return policy” as the support tech suggested when he wouldn’t or maybe couldn’t help me. I got the new seat and now it’s working great. It’s over the top luxury for one’s rear end but it’s worth it. I’m giving it 4 stars now but not 5 because of my experience with customer support, although TOTO has been very nice with their followup messages.

———————————————————————————-

Initial review:
I received the bidet seat and had it installed. When I tried to use it, the cleaning wand would not extend far enough to properly wash. It would start to extend a short distance then stop short with a grinding sound and not extend any further. Needless to say it would not perform any adequate washing. I called Toto customer support and talked to a support tech (I’ll not provide his name) and described the issue. The response I eventually received from him could be summed up as RTFM and he provided me with a link to the manual, although he said it in nicer terms. I told him that was unhelpful as I of course had the manual and I had already read the manual trying to figure out what was going on. I told him that if that was how Toto support was going to help, I would just return the item to Amazon and try a replacement. He replied that he believed the wand extends as specified and that I should take advantage of Amazon’s generous return policy.

So, for now I’m giving the bidet seat 1 star mostly for the lack of any helpful customer support."
"This is the third generation of Washlet we've installed. The first lasted 7 years. The second lasted 5. I guess we'll see how long this one lasts.

This new one installs easily - just make sure there's no sideways pressure on the hoses or plastic fittings - otherwise the fittings will gush water. These fittings are made for ease of use, not sturdiness or reliability, and needed to be treated with real care. Don't bump the intake hose while cleaning!

The remote is just ... bad. Our first washlet had a large remote, with big buttons. Those buttons were labeled with text, common sense pictograms, and tactile bumps that help visually impaired to use to operate the machine.

The machine's remote was a massive step backwards, with membrane switches hidden beneath the surface of a smooth remote - if you were visually impaired, forget it.

And the remote on this new unit is even smaller, with no switches at all - it just registers if you touch the right spot (if you're visually impaired, you're still out of luck. Unfortunately, the pictograms (no words) are now indistinct and non-intuitive. Yes, one learns them, but it's bad engineering. And, the top few buttons require a press, but the bottom three require a swipe. Why? Again, it's just brain dead ergonomics.

The in and out positioning of the wand no longer covers the right spot when I am seated comfortably. I have to adjust the wand all the way to the end of its travel and then move further on the seat.

And, lastly, the lid is still non-structural. Don't attempt to sit on it."
"Feature experience in a buttshell:

Walk in, there's a night light. Lid raises itself when it senses motion. The seat is heated and turns on a vent fan with charcoal filter when you sit down.

The water is heated. The remote is easy to use and is smooth and touch based, easy to disinfect.

Has 5 water pressure levels. Nozzle can be moved via remote forward and back through 5 positions. Button to shoot water in pulses, as well as a slight side to side movement.

Has a warm air dryer for afterward. You flush the toilet yourself, but the lid will close itself a minute after you leave.

Lid raising can be disabled if desired. Seat and water temperature can be adjusted as well.

*Note: You CAN raise the seat via the remote as well for standing up or for cleaning. The button is on the very top of the remote, not the face of it.

It's expensive but if you can swing the price you'll love it. However as great as the features are, if you something much cheaper like the 350 or 200 you'll still get great key features.

Installation was very simple for me, however I should note that I installed it on a Toto toilet. I believe these can fit on any decent standard toilet, but I just mention this for the sake of clearing.

If you have trouble with the instructions I highly recommend just looking up a YouTube video. It's very very easy but the instructions detailed in many languages makes things a bit muddled in the manual."
"I tasked my butler with improving my defecation experience. After trying a stool, cashmere blend toilet paper, and having him assist in the cleaning stage, I was still unhappy.

My butler knows when I am unhappy so he did some research on the computer system and found me this bidet.

I must say, once he showed me how it worked, I have been wowed since. Here are my pros and cons of the device:

PROS:
- Great pressure
- Seemingly infinite warm water supply
- Awesome auto lid
- My butler also wanted me to add the pre/post toilet spray. Apparently it makes the toilet easier to maintain. I don't understand.

CONS:
- The remote looks like it was made in 1985. It should be 1/5th of the thickness
- The remote is two sided so you can't easily get to the rear buttons after your butler mounts it to the wall. This would be fine if those buttons were rarely used but they are the temperature controls for the water, seat, and heated dryer.
- My butler wanted me to add price. He says it is a bit too expensive for what it does. I don't understand.

Overall I would encourage your butler to look into this bidet for you. You will not be dissapointed."
"bought them both. Really wanted to like the brondell swash better. But toto wins - sent the swash back
Seat: Toto seat is warmer, bigger, more comfortable - envelopes you in warmth. Swash hole is smaller and the whole thing just is too little - i am a size 8-10 woman, so not all that big. The toto seat is not as stable as the swash
Water temp: Toto is warmer. but the real benefit is the instantaneous warm water. The swash has just a very short delay, but even a nanosecond of cold water on your butt is surprising every time - Yipes!
Reach: Toto reaches farther forward - important for women
Color: Swash beige is a little lighter - better matches kohler
Remote: Toto is nicer looking, but not intuitive -had to read the instructions to learn that it uses a slide (rather than touch) system to select user and temp/reach. it has a back and a front side, so until you dial it in, you have to keep turning it over. It would be better if it would default to the last setting, or you could set a default. and if there was a personal setting for reach, so you don't have to select that each time."
So glad I ordered this for the bathroom remodel. It is fantastic and fit my present toilet very well. I sing its praises every day. Everyone should own one and people with septics should definitely own one as they cut down on toilet paper use. This seat is so super that I can't praise it enough. It isn't difficult to use and it is so comfortable and comforting.
"**UPDATE** I am on a beautiful, tropical location and am enjoying it just a teensy bit less than I should be - I miss my Toto Washlet!

**ANOTHER UPDATE** The second and final stop on our trip is a lovely rental. The thoughtful owner has a Toto Washlet on the commode! This girl is now completely happy!

My only regret in making this purchase was realizing I waited years too long! The cleaning and dryer features do the job advertised. The remote is easy to use and I'm glad I can program it for my needs and not have to make adjustments every time I take a seat. Two minor gripes. 1) I wish the sensor could be adjusted by distance. I have a small bathroom. The only other option to disabling the auto-open is to listen to the seat opening and closing while going about my morning and evening routines. 2) I know the seat needs to be lightweight, but I expect better quality materials. The lid scratches very easily and there are already a couple of marks just from installation."
Seat not as comfortable as the old Jasmine Elongated Toto Washlet. Miss that model.
"This is a fantastic product and extremely easy to install. I ordered Toto Drake II toilets from Lowes so that the Toto Washlet would fit perfectly. The plumber who installed the toilet told me ""these Japanese toilet seats cannot be installed on this American made toilet. I cannot install this seat because there are no water lines for these seats."" He could not be more wrong. He installed the Toto Drake II toilet without a seat. When he left the house, it literally took me (absolutely zero knowledge of home repair) less than 10 minutes. I cannot explain to you how easy this seat is to install on a Toto toilet (I have no idea if it'll install perfectly on other brands).

The controls are very easy to operate. I like that the seat pre-mists the side of the bowel so that waste is not stuck to the side. The seat warmer is incredible. It can get very hot if set at the warmest setting. The washlet is powerful and does the job well. The blow dryer is not powerful enough to dry quickly (completely understandable because there is not much room to place a motor powerful enough to dry quickly). The dryer air is very warm, though.

One of the reasons why I did not give it 5 stars is that it feels like the seat pushes you forward a little. It makes sense because the ""engine"" is in the rear, so the rear of the seat is higher than the front of the seat. This may not affect a small booty, but I'm 6'1"" 240 LBS.

The other reason why I did not give it 5 stars is that in order to stop the stream of water you have to press the blow dryer button. This would not be a big deal if I did not have guests using my restroom. I have to explain to them everytime that if you use the washlet, it will not stop until you press the ""wavy line button."" I wish you could press the washlet button twice to turn it off because that is the first thing everyone does to try to stop the washlet from spraying, but that does not stop the water from spraying."
This has been a wonderful upgrade in our house. The wife uses the front cleaning function and the rear and just loves how clean everything has been. It’s easy to use and the motion sensor for the lid is very sensitive. If you are considering this bidet then I would say look no further.
Funciona bien luego de unos días dejo de funcionar el sistema que sale y tira agua. Ya no habría la tapa.
"This device is absolutely fantastic. It is very well-made. The installation and operating instructions are clear and easy to understand.

Everything works exactly as described. It is precise, sleek, quiet, and easy to use. The warm seat and water are simply delightful. Makes using the toilet a pleasant experience.

I highly recommend the Toto Washlet. You should definitely buy one.

Installation is so simple. Takes less than 30 minutes. The only place you'll need a pro is an electrician to install the electrical outlet next to your toilet. Get the outlet installed as soon as you place your order. You don't want to wait after your Washlet arrives."
"Easy to install. I made sure that I watched plenty on YouTube videos before making the purchase. Most important is to have a power source or outlet for the seat. Without power, it is just an expensive toilet seat.

Install took about 45 minutes including emptying the tank and removing the old seat.

Fantastic seat. The remote is a little tricky, and there are NASA level functions. But it is absolutely worth the purchase at its basic level use."
"My dream come true! Having visited Japan many times, I always longed to have a washlet. Finally, our bathroom renovation made this dream possible and I couldn't be happier. As some have noted, the auto open/close is bliss but annoying if the toilet isn't placed in a separate water closet or a big bathroom b/c the sensor is so sensitive as to open anytime you even think about coming close to it -- yes it seems to read your thoughts lol (just joking). e-water and onboard hot water heater are great features that you would miss if you didn't have them. good water strength, fully adjustable seat warmth and fan. deodorizer is necromancy that I don't understand but glad I have, no more bathroom smells, period. remote is very intuitive. Only thing I don't understand is why they don't have a button on the top of the remote for just opening the toilet lid. the button on the top of the remote opens the lid and seat -- a godsend for men. But there is real estate on the top of the remote for a dedicated button for just opening the lid as well, which would be great for women --- especially if the auto open/close is disabled. Don't understand this omission; only guess is that TOTO, being a Japanese company, is patriarchal. Could be just that simple, 'cause otherwise in such a feature rich product this omission makes no sense. Easy to clean. I had plumber install it but installation video shows that its not so difficult."
"I have used bidet before, but nothing prepared me for the experience I've had with the Toto Bidet Seat! It washes and dries and does all the fancy stuff the other seats do, but.... the most unexpected feature is that this is absolutely no SMELL!! I did not expect that to be the most noteworthy part of this bidet! I'm not sure how they do it, but both my husband and I have noticed it. This might be the best invention ever! There is a complete absence of any smell. This is quite a pleasant surprise, especially when you don't want to leave the bathroom smelling bad. The bidet has wonderful automated features as well. The lid lifts up when it detects motion, then the unit sprays the bowl to prevent anything from sticking to it. I'm thinking it must add a deodorizer at that point, although you cannot smell anything. It comes with a remote control that can be mounted on the wall as well. My husband thought I was crazy for wanting a bidet, but now he is sold on it. We recently spend the weekend in a hotel at the coast and he said he missed our Toto toilet. lol. We tried a less expensive seat and we not at all happy with the way it looked and it certainly didn't perform like the Toto does. So happy I sent the other seat back and got this one!"
"This is my new favorite thing. I don't know how I lived without it so long. It welcomes me-- as I stumble bleary-eyed into the bathroom in the middle of the night--with a light, a clean toilet bowl, a raised lid, a warm seat. Even if it didn't make me cleaner I would love it for those things already. Have you ever wanted to thank your toilet seat? Well you will now. And the remote!! With the lovely instructions. I velcroed it onto the wall in its holder and rarely have to lift it out. I just press the buttons right there. So easy. I love how you can change the position of the wand and tempo and strength of the water. I rarely use the dryer (remember to flush first if you do) and still use some tp but much less than before. This has already saved a lot of trees. Since it's pricey it will likely take a year or two before I save in tp money what I spent but worth. Every. Penny. You won't regret it."
Very easy install. This is a luxury product and well worth the premium price. So glad we have it.
"I'd previously owned a Toto S350e for 8 years; excellent washlet. I moved leaving it behind so bought this S550e for my new home.
It's a distinct upgrade from the previous model. Although it has the same overall features - automatic seat open/close, ewater+ - it's even better.
The main improvement is a reduction in nuisance seat opens. If I use the vanity it doesn't trigger the seat to open. It'll only open just as I start to move in front of the toilet. (The provisio is that now I'm approaching the toilet from the left instead of the right for my old S350e model.)
The blow-dry is stronger and warmer and works more effectively although as with the old model it helps to dry things off with a square of bathroom tissue first.
The remote is smaller and I think better styled and more clearly labeled (pictograms, no lettering which comes on a separate backing sheet.)"
So far a nice quality product. Works well. The whole bidet thing is a lot to wrap your arms around...glad I bought this one...only question is what took me so long!
"It’s a life changing device, you will be asking yourself how did you live without it. 100% comfort and 100% clean after using it. If I’m away from home I can’t wait to get back home to use what I feel is an essential product for making sure you are comfortable 24hrs a day. Using a washlet gives you that shower fresh feeling and comfort all day long. It really is a game changer folks. If in doubt go to Hawaii and spend a week at one of the hotels, they all seem to have the Toto washlets, on Waikiki and then you will know what I’m talking about.

That said I wish Toto would provide you the ability to replace the parts like the wand assembly or even de mineralized it every month. After about 3 years expect to send it in to Toto for repair since the nozzles will get clogged with mineral deposits from hard water. For this reason I have two units in my house."
The seat moves...not at all my favorite. Customer service says it was designed that way. You'd expect a regular seat to have to be fixed if it moved with you.
Best price we could find online.
This is our second Toto and it works just as well as our 10 year old seat.
"This is an amazing washlet but for a very specific set of customers who can make use of the automatic functions. If your toilet is in an area by itself so that you don’t trigger the sensors by walking past it, then this washlet is worthwhile for you if you want all the automatic functions. These functions Include auto-closing the lid and seat, auto lights, auto clean wand, auto pre-misting of bowl and auto deodorizing. However, if you have a small bathroom and will be constantly triggering these functions when you walk past the toilet to the shower or tub or elsewhere then these auto functions are wasting water and energy. Most of these functions are nice to have but not if they are constantly going off unnecessarily. Like I said, if your toilet is in a specific location, then this would be great for you.

The other drawback is the energy saving function. You can set a schedule based on 6 hours and 9 hours and it will supposedly learn your routine after 10 days. I may be reading the instructions wrong but I don’t understand the time saver schedule when you can’t set the time. It would be nice to set the times as you may also have a different schedule on the weekends. For this pricing, I expect the toilet to have a “smart” feature. I wonder if this would work with a smart plug but I am afraid to try it.

I wanted to buy this to test out its features and they all work great but I know now that the auto functions do not work for me. If I had known that I would get the cheaper version that not have all these auto functions."
We bought this to repair a Toto toilet seat that stopped working. It works even better!
Have you every bought something and wish you had bought it years ago? After one day I can say this about the toilet seat. Watched a great video on installation and it went perfectly. Finally got tge book out to learn about the remote. Remember when testing push down on the left back of the seat. That’s where the sensor is. I feel so pampered.
"When visiting Japan, I loved how clean I felt at even the public restrooms and had to buy myself one after our renovation. I enjoy every feature it has. I wish it had an UV light disinfect, but it has majority of the features I was seeking. There’s one thing that held me off from giving it a 5 star and that’s because the can cause a mess on the underside of the toilet seat, so I make sure to flush before using the bidet and I also make sure to wipe the underside often."
"Wonderful! There is nothing negative to report on. Needed electrical installed, had that done professionally. Installing the seat was easy and it works great! Not needing TP is life changing! The ewater and deodorizer work great. While the amount the seat costs is more than I would have liked to spend, it was actually worth it. you will love it!"
Love this bidet seat but not enough reach for my wife! We had a bidet seat for years in our last house. Loved the heated seat and the continuous night light but I never used the bidet feature. I finally got around to trying this new one out. How could I resist when it pops up to greet me every time I come near it! Would prefer the bowl light stay on or stay on longer. The only other negative is that my wife has to scoot back and bend forward for the feminine front cycle to reach. She’s only 5’6” and not overweight. I think the wand is made to extend for much smaller women. It needs to extend farther to get a 5 star rating.
"This is now the second time the hall effect sensor which is supposed to detect if the seat is placed properly has failed for me. Moisture/water seems to get up the cracks and corrodes the sensor. This is really extremely poor design when looing at it. It's built as a kind of module, not fully protected from water. Workaround for me will be to just short the sensor, it's a feature I don't need."
Lots of friends asked me where to buy this!
"This is my third Toto. I love that it opens and closes automatically. It's got a ton of features as well, so plan on spending a little time going through the manual and setup. Installation is straight forward. I can imagine being happy missing lots of necessities, but not my Toto! ;-)"
"All the controls I need.
Nice adjustable temps for the seat, water, and air dryer.
Love how the seat automatically opens when you enter the bathroom. Totally cool!
Had to buy a short grounded (3-prong) extension cord to reach the power outlet. https://www.amazon.com/FIRMERST-1875W-Profile-Extension-14AWG/dp/B071XYQ77V/"
"I was hesitant on buying a bidet for the same reasons most folks are. My brother bought one and we were talking about it like only brothers can do.....Anyhow, I researched hard on brand and features and settled on this one. I couldn't be happier. It has performed very well and a cinch to install. It was a little tricky to get the wand positioned but once I did, it simply works perfect. I just bought my second one for our master bath. It would be really hard going back to using toilet paper."
"If you want a toilet seat bidet with all the bells and whistles, this is the one for you. I originally wanted the next model down where the lid didn't open or close automatically when you exited or entered a room and it didn't light up. $400 for those two extra features? In my opinion, not worth it, but my husband wanted all the extras. Regardless, this is a quality product and depending on what features you're looking for, I think you'll find what you want somewhere in Toto's product lineup."
"I purchased the Mia product a little over a year ago after we visited Japan and saw the clear reason why a washlet is the way to go. Toto is all over Japan, so it seemed like the obvious choice. The unit is more loose than a standard toilet seat, but according to the company that is by design. Three weeks ago I noticed the unit wasn’t working. I tried powering it on and nothing. I then checked the GFCI and it was tripped. I tried several things, including resetting the GFCI and that outlet for both a hairdryer and a vacuum…no issues. I then called Toto and spoke with their technical support team. The associate was very polite no stated, because the unit was so close to in warranty, he would try to have it approved for free repairs. I shipped the unit with the provided label, a process that was admittedly easy. They next thing I know I receive an invoice for the price of the repairs. $175. Listed are a list of “malfunctions” and parts that required replacement. I quickly called for an explanation. After speaking with one associate and being sent to a random voicemail that no one answered, I called back again. This associate was very rude and accused my electrical of causing all the issues. I politely stated that there have been no issues with any other devices and that regardless the unit is expensive and barely out of warranty. I also referenced my initial call and that these repairs would likely be complimentary. This seemed to offend him and he got even more abrasive. When I called him out on this he said he would just send me to a manager. The call was transferred immediately to another voicemail. This just seems so unacceptable. I would stay away from Toto products."
"After mulling it over for some time, We purchased this one and Love It ! Not only does it leave you squeaky clean, you can plan on using less Toilet Paper. While the warm air dryer does a great job, you need only a couple sheets to feel completely dry. There are less expensive units available, but Toto builds a Quality product. While only having the unit a month or so, we cannot imagine NOT having one now. Quality always beats Price in the long run. Buy the best, buy Toto ! PS: If things were to change I’ll be sure an Update..Happy Bideting Everyone !"
"Hi - I'm updating my review of this product. I've owned it for over two years now and the bad reviews I gave it before are simply because I didn't have the product adjusted correctly. My biggest perceived issue was the water pressure, but I came to find that wasn't the problem. The problem was the water temp is set to warm out of the box so I wasn't really ""feeling"" where the water was cleansing me. After I changed the temp to cold, I could feel where it was hitting me just fine. I adjust my seat, adjusted my personal position and put the water back to warm. It's been cleaning me thoroughly ever since.

I LOOOVE this product and sorely miss it when I'm somewhere away from home. If you buy this, which I recommend, you won't regret it. It's luxurious and very effective. Just be mindful you may need to change the water temp to cold to ""feel out"" the settings and get everything ""tuned"" to you. Once you do that you should be all set."
"I got turned on to the small $30 attachment bidets and this is like THE DREAM upgrade. The diversity and range of functions and thought put into the engineering and design is really impressive. The seat and water are consistently warm, the positioning is fully adjustable, the drying feature gets REALLY hot on the highest setting so plenty of power there. I do have to say the ability for the unit to deodorize works extremely well. It has a built in fan to force air through a carbon filter and it definitely works. I would buy this for any friend or family member just because they are that good and impressive. Super happy with this purchase and I hope it stands the test of time."
"I had never even used a bidet before thoroughly researching and ordering this model. I believe it is close to the best consumer level bidet available, and everything about it exudes that. From the automatic lifting seat, to the perfectly heated water and seat itself, using this thing is a dream. I got this because I usually take 10-15 minutes to use the bathroom as a meticulous wiper. This thing cuts that down so much, but it is so wonderful you won't want to stop using it anyway. I feel much cleaner, much faster.

This thing is pure luxury. Would recommend to everyone."
"Before selecting and purchasing this item I read the reviews, so far we have not had any of the issues that were identified and are pleased with the operation of the S550E. Water pressure is more than sufficient. The seat is securely connected to the toilet with no slippage. The remote is fairly straight forward; the small square dot at the top turns off the buttocks washer. The installations was fairly straight forward if you read the directions and don't just take a WAG

The only drawbacks were this model did not come with an auto flush feature and the auto seat (up) needs to be faster as there are times when it is really needed.

Over all very pleased."
"The Toto s550 is great; easy to install and a breeze to program for personal setting. You will need to run a 110v receptacle near yiur toilet in order to use this washlet. I ran a new 20amp breaker 12/2 romex wire from my electrical box up my attic and down to the master bath toilet area. I have a single story, so it was easy to do. Overall, love it. Once you use this, it’s hard to go back to using toilet paper. It has heated seat, heated water and heated dryer."
" This is my second one.. by far the best investment ever to spend on your house... you go #1, #2 everyday!! The wifey loves it too! It was the first thing she wanted us to get when we moved into the new house.. pretty easy to install, you only need a pair of pliers and a screw driver.

It auto opens when u walk by it, you press the button for the lid to pop up, the seat is always warm, there’s a LED light for the night walkers, the bidet is pretty awesome with warm water... I mean, stop messing around with any other ones and GET THIS ONE. I’ve already did the research for you. I got mine for about $850 or so. Most others don’t have the auto open feature.

So do your butts a favor and get this and thank me later"
"This is the second washout seat we have purchased. The first was a Kohler in our master bath. It is my husband's favorite part of the bathroom remodel.

We decided to get a Toto for a downstairs bath as we already had a Toto toilet. It's great, and the feature my husband likes best is it has a remote control. You will feel fresh and clean and use less, or no, TP. Worth every penny. It opens when you walk in the room. It lights up in the dark. The seat is heated, and on and on. These bidet seats are fabulous as you can have a bidet and a toilet in one space."
"Install was an absolute breeze firstly. Anyone can fit it (its harder to put a GFCI socket nearby that fit the washlet)
3* as some remote features are on the back of the remote and a screw driver is needed to remove it.

THE most stupid design - the bowl lights up when the lid raises (baring in mind you have the side lights to find the toilet) - it 'pre-mists' and the bowl light turns off.
Guess when the bowl light DOESNT light up - yep - the one time you need a light in the bowl - when you raise the seat (not the lid) and pee at night.

Could have been so simple - when the seat is raised, turn the bowl light on (for cleaning or stand up peeing) - $1000 bidet seat and they couldnt do something so simple. No firmware updates, no programming capabilities - such a facepalm moment!

Outside of this oversight, the water is always warm, cosy seat, and everything else functions well."
"This actually does everything as advertised, but the sensor is probably too sensitive for a larger typical American bathroom. Every time I get near the front of it, it activates when I rather it stay silent. It would probably be better to use it in a smaller bathroom or in a typical Japanese style guest bathroom, where ther is only the toilet and a small sink. Otherwise, it is a great toilet seat that will impress all of your friends!"
"We are very pleased with the washlet. The remote/unit is very easy to utilize. Because we have a fully-skirted Toto one piece toilet, our toilet needed to be lifted to remove the old seat and install the new washlet seat so we hired a plumber because we don’t have those skills. Prior to this, we also hired an electrician to install a gfci outlet in the toilet room. My husband loves not having to lift and lower the seat (I’ll keep the remote setting this way for now until I get tired of having to push the remote and lower the seat for myself. I use the toilet more often than he does, so I’ll probably change that setting soon and make him use the remote instead...too bad for hubby). :)"
"Easy install, just follow the directions.
Remote is fun and just takes a bit of time to read and program, but she is very happy with it now that her preferences are programmed.
Great product, a bit pricey but worth it to have it rated by her ""The best Christmas Present Ever""."
"So our household is all male, which means we stand when we urinate. The toilet seat, which hangs in from the edge of the toilet, is a collector of urine. The wand door, meant for cleaning, is basically a target for the boys to aim at. You have to completely remove the toilet seat and filter and clean both. If you don't do this regularly then the vent will basically fill your bathroom with the odor of old urine.

So even for those who clean their toilets regularly, there's this hidden compartment that can only be cleaned when you remove the entire toilet seat, which is connected to water and power.

The other thing that I don't like is that it creates an angled sitting experience. I guess after sitting on a flat toilet seat my entire life, the angle just doesn't feel comfortable to me. It would appear that they needed to do this to accommodate the electronics and wand.

We love the bidet function, so much so that we purchased integrated bidet toilets so that we could have a cleaner experience and replaced these.

My honest opinion, it's a good seat, if you don't have men using it and you don't mind the angle."
Excellent product
"This is my second Toto bidet. I stuck with Toto after being satisfied with my prior entry-level unit. I had high expectations for this top-tier model. Overall, I’m mostly satisfied, but it’s beyond comprehension how after several YEARS of feedback Toto hasn’t fixed the two most obvious lacking design points:

1) LEAVE THE %@#* LIGHT ON!! This unit comes with a bowl light. It’s well placed and just the right amount of brightness. But it ONLY comes on for a few seconds when the device is self-cleaning! Why? WHY?!? What’s the point of having a bowl light if the user never gets to take advantage of it? There are hundreds of add-on bowl light products on the market. How many of them come on for three seconds then turn off? NONE OF THEM because that would be STUPID and USELESS.

2) SAVE ALL THE SETTINGS. The remote has two memory slots, but they only save TWO of the FIVE front panel settings. Why have a convenient one-swipe memory recall if I ALWAYS have to tap FOUR more buttons to make the bidet do the thing I ALWAYS want after pooping?

I’d be frustrated if a $100 bidet had these glaring oversights. It’s simply ridiculous to have these flaws in a $1,000 bidet!"
"The first time I tried it I thought for sure it was going back. Then I learned to move around enough and relax enough to let the water jets do their magic. What is interesting is that once I learned this properly (only a week so far) it has varied between 99-100% cleaning. Best yet, hemeroids are responding and you actually FEEL cleaner with no irritation. It meets my highest expectations. I always wondered about these and how well they worked after seeing them displayed at CES over the years. I expect to replace the whole toilet in the second bath with a full unit next.
Give it a chance. The first time results might not impress. I need to study the remote programming to eliminate seat heating when power cost is high and likelihood of use is low.
I resisted the temptation to post photos .... like before and after ;)"
"After having spent time in Japan my fiance and I were sorely disappointed to come home to our normal unsophisticated toilet. You wouldn't think it would matter that much, but boy does a washlet change your bathroom experience. When our old toilet started to leak, I jumped on the opportunity to replace it with a washlet.

I did the research and determined the S550e Washlet was among the best for the value. It has a lot of great features including temperature control; position control; ladies spray with wide option; rear spray with pulsing; oscillating; air dryer; heated seat; night light - you name it.

It leaves you with such a nice clean feeling and with all the features it's sure to do the job. I also love the night light feature, as I'm prone to tripping over the dog, walking into the door, etc. in the dark. A little feature I didn't know I would appreciate so much."
"I cannot speak to comparisons with other, cheaper products. However, this does deliver the goods.

Heated seats are terrific.

Water pressure is as good as you need - unless you want a pressure washer giving you an enema and drilling a hole in you colon. This is as high as you need or want before blood letting occurs. LOL

Pulsing and massaging features are not as good as they could be.

Heated fan is good but could certainly blow harder to dry faster.

Otherwise it is precisely what I wanted minus the insanely over priced element. On that, it gets a zero. It simply isn’t sophisticated enough to warrant the price. It’s a toilet seat. It would be a fair priced product at $300 for best bidet and $150 for cheapest electric bidet. Anything over and make sure you have disposable cash to justify purchase."
"After my wife and I visited Japan and Korea where these type of units are everywhere, I knew we had to have one at home. I did have to install an electrical outlet, but there was one on the other side of the wall, so adding one on was extremely simple (it was already GFCI protected for the line don't worry). But other than the outlet the install was braindead simple. It's so luxurious to have the heated seat on a cold morning and the nice warm water leaves you feeling so clean. Having 2 different person pre-settings is very nice for the wife and I and there are a lot of options on the temp, pressure, position, etc. I'll be adding another one or two of these to the house in the near future."
"1. The connector of the original water inlet pipe of my house is a small head (see picture 1), but my house received a toilet cover from your company, and the three-terminal connector configured in it (see picture 2). Two of them are big heads. One is a small head, please replace all the joints with small heads so that they can match the current water pipe joints (see picture 1).
2. The original water inlet pipe of my toilet is a rigid pipe. Would your company provide a tool to bend the hard pipe?
We have feedbacked the above comments a few days ago, but so far, we have not received any reply, resulting in the smart toilet cover of your company that we purchased has not been installed, so please reply to the following email immediately : 163.fanrongzeng@163.com, please ask your company to submit a solution by email."
"THREE Major Pet Peeves! The ""night Light"" more like a search light is placed to the left side by the water inlet. This means in the evening when you want to find your way to your throne you will need to purchase an additional night light light that swivels towards an open door. More disturbing for the price, there is no ""blue"" light that illuminates the bowl area. So once again, if you prefer to stand at attention, assume some misfires. Lastly, the highly Appelesque ... remote has no buttons (so to speak) and isn't lit up so you are going to have to pray you don't push the wrong sensor or your evening will end with using a bidet."
"Comfort, hygiene and high quality. Pricey, but worth every penny. We own two washlets, and this one is fifth I've purchased over long time"
It's just great. I may never wipe again.
"Our C200 round seat we had used for over a year would no longer fit our elongated toilets in our new apartment, so we decided to take the opportunity to upgrade to the S550e. The extra features we expected to be gimmicks are certainly ones we can’t imagine without. The auto close/open is surprisingly convenient that I avoid using the closer, second bathroom even for just “#1” so that I don’t have to touch the seat. Ewater+ certainly does a better job of preventing residue from sticking to the sides of the toilet. The dryer is way more powerful that the c200s - I had to lower the temperature setting for how warm the air gets. So far I’m highly satisfied after a couple of weeks of use."
Previos model we purchased 10 years ago had a bigger seat. Purchased 3 auto close models a month ago and we find the seat too small. Otherwise would be 5 stars.
"I had the previous model that broken unfortunately, but the new model is better and easier to control with the remote."
"I do not normally leave reviews but this product has moved me to do so. Yes it is a little pricey but it is WELL WORTH the price. I've had mine about a month now and it has totally changed my life. I don't want to go into detail but the problems I had that made me purchase this product are completely gone! I love all the features the Toto provides. Now, as the world is opening back up, I don't want to leave home as I'll miss the pampering my toilet seat gives me."
"I recently upgraded my bathroom with the Toto S7A bidet seat, which is replacing a much cheaper (and now faulty) Luxe E850 bidet seat (Amazon have stopped selling this). The S7A by Toto is 4 times the cost, but I do hope it'll last a lot longer than the cheaper alternative.

Installation was a breeze, taking less than 30 minutes from unboxing to first use. It's exactly what you'd expect from Toto, the Japanese masters of toilet technology - high quality, innovative, and user-friendly.

However, not everything is perfect. I'm disappointed that the bowl light doesn't stay on by default. You spend this much on a bidet toilet seat, and you want it to look nice. The cheaper seat it replaced had an LED night light in the bowl which stayed on (timed for 12 hours). Unless I can't figure out the manual, I can't get the same on the Toto.

Additionally, the seat lid doesn't recline as far back as I'd like, and unfortunately, this isn't adjustable, which is a minor annoyance in an otherwise stellar product.

The remote control is a highlight, packed with features to tailor your experience. The most frequently used functions are conveniently located on the front, making them easily accessible. For the more specific settings, buttons on the back handle your custom preferences. Admittedly, navigating these settings can require a quick consult with the manual due to the combination of different buttons needed. Thankfully, the default settings are spot-on, so most users won't need to fiddle much to enjoy a comfortable experience."
Easy installation. Works well. Only wish it allowed for an inline water filter.
"Of course, I noticed it after full installation and am now trying to figure out how to replace the unit or just that piece so I don't have to dismantle everything from the install. I should note, the product itself seemed great, and this review reflect more frustration that it arrived damaged in the packaging."
Finally pulled the trigger and got a Toto. Have another brand in the house but this one I love. Wish it was in my owner bathroom. Love all the features. Wish I could have this exact one in all my bathrooms.
"First, this bidet seat is not cheap. Second you will need electricity to operate it. Third, get ready to enjoy a spa-like experience. Toto makes quality products and it has been making bidets and toilets for decades. That experience shows in the ease and logic of installation. Like many tech gadgets it probably has far more controls and operating choices than most people need. This newest model is a new version of one of its most popular bidet washlets (550e). It is slimmer but retains its classic look and I must say unobtrusive shape. Some reviewers seem to see the new remote as cheaper looking and more difficult to change settings. But so far I haven’t found any issues for our use. There are other brands and cheaper models. But if you are looking for a full-featured bidet seat with high reliability and can afford its price, this product is highly recommended."
"Ever since I installed the TOTO WASHLET+ in my humble abode, my bathroom visits have transformed from mundane to monarchial! This isn't just a bidet seat; it's a throne upgrade for your tushy.

First Impressions:
When I first unboxed this marvel of modern hygiene, I half-expected it to come with a crown. The sleek design in Cotton White is not just a bidet seat; it's the Rolls Royce of rear-end pampering.

The Royal Treatment:
Let's talk about the warm breeze for drying. Gone are the days of the awkward wiggle or the endless toilet paper roll spinning. This warm breeze is like a gentle, loving hug for your posterior, whispering sweet nothings as it dries you off.

And the quick pulsating wash? Oh, it's like having your own personal butt butler, dedicated to keeping your derriere in pristine condition. Whether it's a 'light dusting' or a 'deep cleanse', this bidet has got you covered (or, well, uncovered).

Game-Changer:
I used to read books in the living room, but now my best reading nook is right here on my TOTO. I mean, why leave the comfort of a warm seat and a personal washlet?

Final Thoughts:
In conclusion, if you love your behind (and let's be honest, who doesn't?), this TOTO WASHLET+ is the investment of the decade. It's like giving your butt a first-class ticket to a tropical paradise, without the hassle of packing.

10/10, would recommend for anyone who wants their bathroom experience to be less 'meh' and more 'majestic'."
"Never used a bidet before, but decided to give it a shot with this one. Install was easy, setup was easy. Don’t have anything to compare it to, but add me to the “why haven’t I been using this for years” column. Quality seems great, instructions were good, and it even included brand-name batteries in the package."
"Well I finally pulled the trigger on a washlet. I have a friend that has a TOTO and he and his wife always talk about how it has changed their life. I did test drive it in his home and it was actually very nice. I was not sure what it would feel like to get a spray rinse, but after I laughed out loud at first, that test drive sealed the deal for me. I saw on Amazon that a new version has been listed and decided to buy as an early gift for my wife and I for the holidays. She loves the auto open lid, the heated seat and of course the spray rinse. We had talked it about getting one and we so pleased with the overall experience.

I did my homework on TOTO and our home now has the very best bidet in the market.

Thanks TOTO"
"This S7 series bidet has a lot of great features but it is just not as effective at cleaning as the 500e. Maybe ours is defective but I believe the S7 uses a new technology in the sprayer to make it more comfortable but it actually does a poorer job and is much louder......very disappointed, my upgrade turned out to be a downgrade"
"I had no idea it would be this nice. Never used one before, but my wife wanted one, so I got her this one. It's really easy to set up and program. Installation was a breeze. Now we're both spoiled!"
"The jet quality is a small improvement over the previous gen. It is very easy to clean with no dead spots or seams worth mentioning. I've grown to like the panel... No apps to mine your toilet habits or become outdated. I've only memorized the nightlight Konami code. I installed an Auto-flush unit, and it's working great... With one annoying exception...

The lid will close on you. Often. There are sonar and pressure sensors, but they don't like it if you spread your legs and lean. If someone knows of firmware to fix it, lmk. It's specially bad with the auto flush unit, as the lid will close on you, crash into you, and then flush while you're sitting on it and applying pressure. It's as if the seat was only tested by tiny JK who sit with their legs closed in a tiny bathroom and don't move around because they're on camera.

With all that said, great purchase... But not for everyone. In my month with it, it always closed the lid and flushed for me. If you're not going to use an auto flush unit, cheap out and go for a C5 or s500e."
"High-quality, top-of-the-line royal flush robotics. I replaced and upgraded my twenty-year-old technology toilets and traditional toilet seats with TOTO S7A Washlets.

I don't clean my dishes with dry paper or my vehicles with dry cloth; why this outdated mindset of cleaning ourselves? With toilet paper thirty dollars plus for thirty-two to forty-eight packs, I no longer use dry paper, smearing the paint on canvas, flushing money down the toilet. I will never look back at paper use again."
"Since installing our new bidet, we've really enjoyed it. This is our first bidet in our house. We've enjoyed the warm seat on those cold winter midnight bathroom runs. I feel that my butt has had way fewer instances of inflammation from over wiping now. My partner loves the female features and the warm water! There is so many features built-in that we haven't even explored all of them yet. Really the best home upgrade this year was purchasing this bidet for our master bathroom! 🙌"
I bought this because I suffer from GI issues. I wish I hadn't waited so many years! It's been a game-changer! Well worth the price tag.
"Great seller, good customer service.
I don't like the new remote as much as the old style. The seat is better though, no more needing to store water in the seat itself. The seat open sensor is better than the old style also, no more false opening.

Make sure your toilet handle is on the side, or you don't have a skinny tank, otherwise the seat lid will cover the flush handle. This is a toilet tank issue, not a Toto issue."
"Was introduced to bidets while on a recent vacation. Came home and started researching bidet seats. Bought this one and the K300 due to TOTO’s reputation and the fact that all three toilets in my home are TOTOs. Since I’m pretty handy, I found both units ti be easy to install; and, there are plenty of YouTube videos to help out. Lots of features, nice look, comfortable, and it gets the job done!!

My only complaint is that Amazon’s price dropped $100+ the following week on this unit. Am checking to see if I can get a refund/credit for the price drop."
You don’t even know what you’re missing
"I use waslet for more than 15 years. I bought S7a to replace an older model. There are no substantial improvement over previous model. However, I’m shocked how the engineers of Toto are ignoring the user interface. My first washlet had an easy to read LCD, it was very useful. My second model had a horrible LCD hidden at the back of the remote, not a good interface but I was able to do the basic setup. For the S7a, Toto made the absurd decision to remove the LCD totally. It is now impossible to adjust the configuration without a PhD or hacking skills. You are forced to press random buttons in random sequence. I’m an engineer and I feel that I’m back 40 years in time. Frogs is $1500-$2000 product made totally unconfigurable now. Toto, if you want to remove the LCD, it would be better to offer a Bluetooth app to configure though the phone. I’m really disappointed with Toto, and I started noticing they are treating US customers with disdain by making absurd deciisions to save a few dollars while keeping premium prices"
"It's easy to install. The ring fits our toilet 90%, good enough for us. It looks modern. And it warms water quick enough when you use it. We feel very clean after using it, so very content with that.

One thing didn't go smoothly is that it kept leaking slowly every time we flush. We had to email the support. But luckily the support lady Natcha was helpful and after we sent a video, she quickly helped us figure out where should be tightened. After that the leak was gone. We are thankful for that.

Although two things I think can still be improved: 1) the support phone number and website on Amazon page is wrong! It points to the car manufacturer Volvo's support and website, that wasted me some time to call them; 2) the connectors could use some better washer to make it easier to seal. We had leak in T connector in the beginning until we used one of our spare washer."
"What you're reading now is an update to my original, 2-star review. I'll be transparent about my interaction with VOVO to understand why I feel they earned a 5-star update.

I originally reviewed poorly for the lack of memory of your previous settings; the bidet would reset to default settings with every use, which I found tedious. After leaving my review, I was contacted by a VOVO representative. They understood my feedback and immediately wanted to replace my unit with another, one that included a remote rather than a side panel and would remember your settings (VB-6100SR). I accepted the offer and was pleased with the product. The only sacrifice made was the side panel, but the remote includes mounting accessories and even an adhesive backing with holster to be able to place wherever you would like, so the sacrifice is small. Since this major issue is resolved from my end, I see no obstruction to a 5-star review. I'd like to commend VOVO for employing representatives that are keen and knowledgeable of their own products to resolve my situation, and I get the feeling that they will consider this with future models without a remote.

PLEASE NOTE: As of writing, the VB-6100S model is the same price as this one. If you'd like your bidet to remember your most recent settings, please consider it.

The original review I wrote will now follow:

I truly want to like this bidet. It was easy to install, looks nice, and has the controls I would want.

However, this will not remember the last settings you used. If you input a different nozzle position, water temperature, seat temperature, etc. while using it, this will be forgotten when you next sit on it. What's interesting is that it will visually show you (with LEDs) which settings you had used last -- until you sit on it, which is a reset.

I had to return it for this because what should have been 1 button became 7."
"Ok, so when I obsess about purchasing something, I do an insane amount of research so I know exactly what I want and want the best deal possible. I wanted a solid performing bidet seat with as many bells and whistles as possible. It took all of five minutes to find Toto was the best, and way out of my price range. I then began to narrow my list down. Things I was looking for: endless hot water, spray strength, enema function, and nightlight. I didn't care too much about: auto opening lid, sittable seat, user memory, or dual nozzle (more moving parts equates more possible failures).

This item hit all those wickets. However, with it being a new product and not many reviews, I was wary. There are a LOT of no name brand bidets coming out of Korea, and not all of them can be trusted. Most of the big name brands haven't come out with a new model in five years or more. I was considering Brondell or Bio Bidet, but couldn't decide between the two. I then decided to take a chance on Vovo, and so far I'm satisfied. Setup was easy, however previous reviews mentioned extra hardware coming and not listed in the breakdown- I received these as well. Night light is nice, but would've preferred a different color than white and an option to dim. The light is always on or off, no light sensor included. The seat warmer works, can only use on the lowest setting. Soft closing lid is convenient as well. The fit was almost perfect on my elongated toilet. The bidet function works well, water is warm, and pressure is good. The stream seems a bit narrow but does the job. There isn't a noticeable difference between normal and enema function- it's all about position. It does effectively clean. The rhythm feature is nice. The air dryer is not only ineffective- it's dangerous. I found that even on the lowest heat setting, my left buttock burned rather quickly. The heated air dryer is located on this side. I just pat dry with two squares of TP, and I'm good to go. The remote is clear and very easy to use. It is a bit cumbersome, however as it is very thick. Just place the mount in a convenient location and you won't need to worry about holding it.

So, all in all I am pretty happy with my purchase. Build quality send fine, and the product has plenty of helpful features along with being effective. There are a few issues, but even the top brands have those, so at half the price point of the competition, I'll deal with it. I just truly hope this bidet stands the test of time, as I won't be able to afford a replacement, nor want to go back to an analog toilet.

If you're like me and obsess over the research and can't decide between the BB2000 or SWASH 1400, save yourself $300 and give VOVO a try. Amazon accepts returns on this, so you have nothing to lose!"
"I ordered the TCB-8100W, it was delivered to me within 3 days. Very fast and safe delivery service!
When I checked the package, all parts are included correctly and I didn't have to buy anything for installation. The instruction manual is very made well to understand the product so that I installed the toilet bidet easily. Very beautiful design and useful functions. Everything is good to work and made my bathroom luxury. I am very satisfied to buy it. I strongly recommend purchasing it for my family and friends !!"
"I've had my Vovo bidet for just under two years now, and I couldn't be happier with my purchase. The water pressure is strong and adjustable, providing a thorough clean every time. The heated seat and dryer are game-changers, making every bathroom experience luxuriously comfortable, especially during the colder months. These features alone have made this bidet an invaluable part of my daily routine.

However, what truly sets Vovo apart is their outstanding customer service. Recently, my unit encountered a problem and stopped working. I reached out to the Vovo USA customer service team, and I was blown away by their response. Not only were they incredibly nice and respectful, but they also went above and beyond to resolve my issue promptly and efficiently. It's rare to find a company that stands so firmly behind their products and values their customers' satisfaction to this extent.

Their team's dedication to ensuring a positive customer experience has solidified my loyalty to their brand. If you're considering a bidet, I cannot recommend Vovo enough. You're not just getting a top-quality product; you're also getting peace of mind knowing that any concerns will be handled with the utmost care and professionalism."
"After returning from Japan trip, we had to have this. Found this one with the most feature and with reasonable price. Bought one, love it then bought another one 2 months later. Too much fighting in the house over 1 toilet, so had to get another one 😄"
"I had a missing part, or I misplaced it... It was just the bracket for the remote. I sent a message to Vovo and their customer service agent Ella replied in less than 5 minutes, and that was at almost midnight. I was told that the part was on the way and even had a tracking number.... all within 5 minutes. The bidet is great, and the seat warmer was toasty for those early Pacific NW mornings."
" The bidet conveniently broke after 1 year of purchase, when the warranty has expired.

The wand constantly leaks water with no way to stop unless the water supply is shut off.

I've tried to contact VOVO via email for several days, but has not heard back at all. Also, the support page on Amazon redirects me to VOLVO CAR and not VOVO."
"I originally ordered the VB-4000ER. I carefully read the dimension guide by Vovo and matched it with my commode which I thought was a round style, but the measurement guide looked like the ER (for elongated style would fit my commode bowl perfectly). As soon as it came I installed it. Installation was easy but when I was all done, the front of the seat extended about 2-3 inches beyond the front of the bowl. I tested the seat and everything worked fine. I was disappointed and initially was going to settle with it but upon researching the other products I thought I should get the VB-4100SR for a better fit. So I uninstalled the seat and packed it up for return/exchange. The return process was easy. I just brought the package to a local UPS store with the QR code Amazon sent me by email. They credited the full amount to my credit card.
I then ordered the VB-4100SR which turned out to fit perfectly to my commode (so be careful with matching thre measurement because they can be deceiving and mislead you) Go with elongated vs. round style regardless of the measurement guides. and as soon as it came I thought it was going to be a piece of cake to install because I have had practice with the elongated model. Well it all went well until I attached the T-connector to the shank of my toilet fill valve. The threads of the shank (made of plastic) and the T-connector (made of metal did not mesh well and when I thought everything was connected properly, water was squirting all around the T-connector swivel. I stopped and went to 3 hardware stores including Ace, Home Depot and Lowes and to my disappointment none of them carried anything like the T-connector so when I came home I immediately called Vovo customer service on their toll-free number in the owner's Manual. I spoke to a lady named Natcha who was very nice and very knowledgable of their products. She asked for my Amazon order number and my shipping address and she sent me a replacement T-connector immediately by overnight service. It arrived 2 days later and it was identical to the T-connector that came with the seat. Right then I figured the problem was not the connector but with the fill valve shank. I did see that the thread of the fill valve shank was badly stripped just from repeated screwing and unscrewing of the 2 different seats. So I went to the hardware store and bought a Flushmaster 400A which came with a brass fitting to replace the original toilet fill valve I had with a trashed thread. I figured this would stnd up better to the metal T-connector. The plastic version of the fill valve cost around $9. The brass version was $14 so for a little more I got a more durable product. Sure enough once I got this, installation was a breeze. Everything worked well without any leaks or other problems. Lessons learned:
1. Be very certain about the measurements of the seat and your toilet bowl and make sure they match perfectly.
2. Be very careful screwing and unscrewing the metal T-connector to the fill valve shank made of plastic. The plastic does not stand a chance with the metal connector. The metal will eat up the pkastic all the time. Once the threads are stripped there is no way to make a water tight seal.
3. It turns out I have a free electrical receptacle not too far from the toilet tank cover on the right side of the commode as you are facing it so I was able to plug in the seat directly without using an extension cord. Now I don't really see the point of every manufacturer emphasizing the need for a GFCI receptacle (which I am sure I can replace) but my bathroom circuit has a GFCI in the circuit breaker in the service panel so I don't see a need for a ground breaker at both ends.
4. This company has a great customer care which takes care of your needs immediately. You talk to a live person who is knowledgable who takes care of your problem right away. You don't need to be transferred from one department to another or to email and wait for an answer -maybe.
This seat is wonderful and works well as expected. As is the seat cover is wobbly from only 1 bumper right in the middle of the seat front. I ordered a set of 4 thick bumpers from Amazon and attached all pretty much to the same spot on the underside of the seat cover correspioding to the 4 bumpers on the bottom of the seat itself. It makes for a more stable cover and seat, but I am still not sure if you could sit on it with the cover closed (it does not appear to be that sturdy). Time will tell.
Very pleased with my purchase. This is my first and believe me I must have reviewed a hundred different product offered by Amazon and there was not one perfect seat. I even watched a lot of YouTube videos all about toilet seat bidets. The recommendations are all over the place. Good luck!"
"I never heard of VOVO before and unfortunately there are no YouTube reviews for it but after checking out the website video/specs I decided to try the top of the line VB4000SE elongated model. My wife and I had been thinking about getting a bidet for quite a while and I looked at some of top brands such as TOTO and Brondell. I watched several video reviews so I knew what features and performance level was offered from the name brands.

The bidet was very well packaged and even included batteries for the remote control. The quick install guide was a laminated color sheet with photos. Very nice except for steps 4&5 that were two pictures on top of each other. Those should have been separated for clarity. The manual has install instructions which are good however there were two long metal screws with metal washers and long soft plastic nuts that were not show or mentioned. I assume they’re for mounting to certain types of toilet bowls but strange they weren’t shown. The one thing I don’t like about the lid is that it is not strong enough to sit on. This may not be a big deal to most.

Installing the bidet and connecting it up to the water supply was a breeze but make sure you have a large enough wrench to tighten the hoses. As most bathroom don’t have an electrical outlet near the bowl, be prepared to use an extension cord or have an electrician install one.

The remote comes with a wall mounted holder but it doesn’t include drywall screws for that. There is double sided tape on the back but if you mount using that, it will wreck the drywall if you need to remove it. There are four control buttons on the water side of the seat for basic functions but you can’t see them when sitting so remember the order if you have to use them. The remote is laid out well and easy to navigate. I read some reviews for name brand models that had remotes that were difficult to use. Can’t imagine that but VOVO’s is straight forward. It seems to work no matter where you hold it so if you don’t want to use the wall mount, no problem. It will be interesting to see how long the batteries last.

So the big question is, does it work well. My answer, yes and maybe too well. The heated seat can get real warm for those who want that. Plastic doesn’t get that cold anyway so I just use the low heat setting. The warmth does feel nice though. The nozzle has positional adjustment so you can aim it right where you need it. It has standard wash as well as a rhythm setting for both posterior as well as feminine washing. The rhythm fells likes it going in a circular pattern. The enema function does what it says so be prepared for that. It starts at the minimum setting then slowly increases. You can stop it at any time. The one feature I was really curious about was the heated water. VOVO uses a tank which means that the warm water can run out. I used the high temperature setting and used the water several consecutive times. I read some reviews that said once tank systems run out the water doesn’t go cold but it’s not warm. The water seemed to last about 40 seconds. Each time I used the function the water started out really warm but never went cool so I was please about that. The heated dry is not very powerful so getting completely dry will take a little while even on the highest setting. I’m not sure how auto deodorant function works or how well. More testing needed on that. The seat releases water over the nozzle each time as a cleaning feature. It can also be extended if a more through manual cleaning is necessary. I wish it had a silver ionic coating which is antimicrobial. That would be more effective at killing germs. Last is the LED bowl light. At first I thought it wasn’t needed but it does help when cleaning the bowl. Overall I’m very please with VOVO’s product.

Pros: Easy install, works very well, easy to use remote, great looking design, made in Korea (quality).

Cons: Lid not strong enough to sit on, lack of antimicrobial nozzle, drying fan could be more powerful, no wall mount screws for the remote ( I wouldn't mind paying a bit more for these features)."
"This was our first Bidet purchase and at first it was great. That was until we purchased our next bidet by another company and the comparisons began. It's a great product but I agree with other reviews that the flush could be much stronger (this was one of the first things we immediately noticed with the use of the other bidet). One thing that I can attest to however is the customer service. We did have a problem just shy of the 1 year warranty running out. The water kept running and after a FaceTime troubleshoot with the company, they sent me a new bidet part that solved the problem immediately. It took about a week and 1/2 from start to finish of diagnostic to receipt of the new part. Overall, it is an ok purchase. Two things though that I would suggest is a thinner remote and a stronger flush."
"I am relatively new to bidets. Upgraded to this unit after local stores wanted $5,000-$7,500 for an all-in-one tankless automatic flush bidet toilet, which seems over the top in cost for what you get! Two weeks before this VOVO unit arrived we also purchased a top-rated Bio-Bidet BB2000 Bidet seat which has great reviews. So within a two-week period, we went from using TP to what is in essence a car wash for your butt, in two of our bathrooms! Installation was straightforward forward and all the parts seem high quality. Note that the VOVO uses a pipe thread hose attachment and requires removal of the angle stop as it uses its own, OR you can try to find a male to female brass adapter at the hardware store. Porcelain casting for the toilet is complete and seems high quality. Our unit came with the screws to mount the remote to the wall as well as the two-sided tape which I'm fine with as either way, the wall needs spackle to fill holes or tape scars IF you take it down. Auto flush is a nice feature and it has a manual override for a full or partial flush, and it uses very little water to get the job done. Water pressure on all wash settings is not as powerful as the Bio-Bidet BB2000 seat we have had now for a few weeks longer, but this unit is known for being one of if not the most powerful bidet on the market. As well the dryer fan is not as powerful as the Bio-Bidet BB2000 and does not seem to get nearly as hot. I like the UV light cleaner, and the odor control fan works well. Remote is easy to use and understand, and there is enough adjustment in the controls to fine-tune water temp, pressure, and positions to satisfy most if not all bottoms. As for fit, as a man, the Bio-Bidet BB2000 elongated seat on an elongated toilet still seems to shorten the overall bowl space front to back so making everything fit free and easy is a drawback and a task for sure. That is not the case with this VOVO all in one unit, which leaves plenty of room for men and women. I was skeptical of the process and experience with a bidet until two weeks ago, but I can honestly say that the extra few minutes spent in the wash and dry cycles do a good job at cleaning without TP, which I still check from time to time. My fiance has to extend all nozzle positions to the farthest reach setting as she feels that the default settings do not wash far enough forward for feminine wash. Time will tell how they both hold up and compare with regular use. As noted by other reviews of both independently, the seat lids are NOT robust and seem as though they would break if one sat on the toilet with the lid closed. If you have a new toilet and want almost all the features of a high-end bidet tankless auto-flush toilet, I highly recommend the Bio-Bidet BB2000 as a less expensive true full quality bidet entry-level purchase before buying a full feature all-in-one tankless auto flush bidet such as the VOVO. But the modern, low-profile sleek look of the VOVO is a definite upgrade and so far so good. And the price of the VOVO when compared to other more well-known brand name auto-flush full feature bidets gives the VOVO a high rating in this market niche."
"When I was Searching on amazon to purchase an electrical bidet toilet seat, among dozen of similar products for sale by different companies , this one from VOVO USA standing out, caught my attention . Because it gives potential buyers a comprehensive description about their product’s unique features, even including a Toilet Fit Check Guide for buyer’s choice. Wow, it is very impressive , I felt that VOVO USA is a customer-minded company! I had no hesitation immediate placed the order to Purchase this one. That was July 13, 2022

Three days later,July 16, product arrived. When opened the packing box, I was so amazed to see that there were only a few items inside the box: a pre-assembled bidet toilet seat, a water hose , a Electric power plug line , and a few special scrows . Unlike seminar products I bought from other companies before, inside their package boxes were dozens of large and small parts, waiting for me to put them together.
Again It is very impressive that VOVO USA did all the assemble work to safe buyer’s time and make buyer’s life easier. It really is a customer-minded company!

More impressive thing VOVO USA did for my purchase I must share with viewers. After my daughter put this bidet toilet seat on my toilet, connected water and power, it is ready to use. However it wasn’t the case. No matter which bottom on control panel, I pushed, no cleaning water come out, no dry air either. I reported to my daughter, she didn’t remember what she did wrong, suggested me “not return to amazon, but call VOVO USA “. I did call to report the problem. The office staff was very friendly, she arranged a FaceTime conversation to show the problem. It was their office manager, Kevin had a FaceTime communication with me He saw the problem shown on control panel. Finally he said to me that “this might be a bed one, we will send you a replacement today.” This words represents its company’s culture: Anxiously satisfy customer’s needs. Moreover, next morning Kevin called and inform me that he will bring a new bidet seat and install it for me today. I was deeply movedI I could not imagine a manager can come to customer’s home to do a plumbing work! Again, I can see Kevin’s offer came from his company’s culture and philosophy : put customer’s needs first
Kevin drove more than one hour from his office to my home, bring a new bidet seat and some tools. Before Remove the “non-function” bidet seat, he thoroughly checked the status of this bidet seat. He found out that the water supply hose, my daughter put on has its own control valve (I did not know that) and the valve was in shut off position..

After turning the valve on, I am so happy to see the bidet seat is working as expected. Thank you Kevin! For your dedicated work, many thanks to VOVO USA, a truly customer-minded company , I will strongly recommend to any one who is planning to purchase a bidet toilet seat. You will not be disappointed!!!"
"I have been using a Brondell Toilet seat bidet long before the pandemic forced people to find alternatives to TP. I was super happy to get a great deal on the beautiful looking Bidet toilet over Black Friday. Unfortunately, the looks is all it has. My previous seat was much better at both heating the water and washing my backside. The water that came out of the Brondell was warm from the start. With each spray of the VOVO, the initial spray is cold followed by warm water (be ready for an icy bottom!). Also, compared to the Brondell, the water pressure is a lot less. I have tried all the adjustments but unable to make it any better.
Overall a 3 because it does look really good and it flushes very well (nice clean bowl no matter what mess I make)."
"Update 1 - Contacted VOVO USA regarding warranty. They immediately issued a refund for the bidet and graciously offered to send me a replacement bidet. I received both the refund and the replacement bidet very quickly. Installed the bidet and it is working. I'm really hoping the replacement bidet lasts because my family really likes it. I'm very impressed with the customer service at VOVO USA. They are very customer focused and it shows. I'm updating my review from two stars to four stars based on the great customer service. I will provide another update after six months regarding product longevity.

This bidet was nice when it worked. Purchased it in March of 2023 and it is dead by September 2023. Paid nearly $400. I will purchase another bidet because the concept is very nice, I simply won't purchase from this company again."
"This was my first bidet and I was very excited to finally try one. This one is getting returned however, because every 3 minutes or so, it releases a splash of water from the nozzle, even when off--so it's basically like having a permanent leaking faucet. I suspect that part may be just a manufacturing defect (I would hope).

But, beyond that, there are a number of other major issues with this, and I would recommend NOT getting units from this manufacturer. I really don't know what to make of the overwhelmingly positive reviews for this bidet, but I will share my detailed observations here to help others to not make the same mistake I did.

INSTRUCTIONS
All instructions, including for assembly, are in very bad english and it's often very difficult to understand. It took me three times longer to install that it would have, if there had been clear instructions. Also, the instructions that are included are not correct--it refers to the wrong number of temperature settings, wrong number of seconds to hold down the stop button to turn off, etc. I believe this is because they are for all of their models, and they have changed behavior between different models. It is nice, however, that they give you a laminated sheet with operating instructions. Just wish the english was better than, ""Sweep the water with toilet paper before using dry function for pleasant using.""

CONTROLS
I don't know what they were thinking, but there is a single control for both the water pressure and the dry air temperature! So, if you want high water pressure (which I have to say seems necessary with this to actually get clean), then you will also be subjected to a burnt butt when you use the dryer (or, conversely, if you want low pressure, then the dry function would then be set to blow cold air on your behind). It's sort of like they just were given a list of functions to check off and the ""engineers"" just combined them in some random way without really thinking of how they would be used.

Also, presumably to cut down on cost, each set of controls that show a lighted bar with arrows to make it more or less lighted, controls two different sets of things. You have to press a button above or below it to adjust that particular function. There is no indicator light to show which function is currently being adjusted, however. Also, some bars light all of the lights up to where it is set, while others only light the one where the setting is, with the others unlit. It took me a few minutes just to figure out which direction was MORE and which was LESS, as there are no markings to indicate that.

The controls overall are very clunky and ugly and provide a very non-intuitive user interface. They could have been done so much more clearly.

FUNCTION
In terms of the actual functionality of this, it sort of works, but not well. I tried using it three times and one out of three times, it left me with a clean behind. It's possible that even after trying, I don't have the nozzle aligned quite right, or that I really do need to use the highest pressure setting for it to work. But it's certainly not like you just point the nozzle and it will do it's job. I'm not sure how finicky other bidets are, but I expect they tend to be better than this.

One thing that is astounding to me is that the wash cycle starts off with warm water, according to the temperature you set it for, but then before it ends, the water gets to be almost fully cold. I suspect the heater they use is underpowered, combined with a reservoir that is smaller than what's needed for a single cleaning cycle. So, the water heats up beforehand, but the warm water is used up before the cycle ends, so that it always ends with cold water being sprayed on you. (I am in New England, so water is cold in the winter, if you lived in Florida, the water temp might be enough warmer that this unit could keep up with heating it, but certainly not in more northern climates)

CONSTRUCTION
The seat cover is thin and flexible plastic, so I was nervous to even try to sit on it as it would flex and I would worry about it breaking or warping. It took me about two dozen attempts to get the main assembly to slide into the base bracket that was attached to the toilet during installation. It was very difficult to align the plastic grooves in the exact way they needed to be aligned to connect, while not being able to see them. It would have been so easy to design a better system for these two pieces to connect together. Overall, it's cheaply made, and the engineering and aesthetics are surprisingly poor. It would feel so much better if everything didn't flex when you sat on it. Jony Ive clearly didn't design these!"
"I ordered this a year ago and after about 9 to 10 months started leaking and then stopped working. I called the manufacturer and I spoke to Ella, who was very courteous and helpful and she shipped me a new item. Overall it is great product while it is working, I hope the new one lasts longer."
"I love almost everything about this seat. I have an Elongated toilet and this sadly turns it into a round one. I guess you don't totally need the room to maneuver anymore with this doing the dirty work for you. But you don't have much room to work with up front, and that's my main reason for having an Elongated toilet. Aside from that, it feels like the aim of the nozzle is too far back even on the farthest setting and have to use the feminine setting just to actually reach everything. Everything else works great. So if you're a smaller person, especially female, I definitely recommend this. If you have a round toilet, I would consider getting a bidet toilet all together, rather than investing in a seat that's going to give you even less room to work with. I got the $400 model, don't really regret it, just wish some things were different."
Easy install works great let’s see in few more months
"The bidet toilet is wonderful. The tankless design is sleek and feature a normal elongated bowl but with a total footprint of 3-4"" less than a standard toilet. Flushing and bidet actions both work great while the sleak outside surface with no visable anchors makes cleaning a breeze. The perfect accompaniment to a modern bathroom remodel.

I had one issue with a damaged bidet top but Ella at VOVO-USA's service email went out of her way to make things right. Everyone I dealt with there was professional and helpful and the result was a perfect new bidet top in less than a week.

I now have 3 identical VOVO toilets and could be happier with all of them."
"My husband and I bought this as a gift to ourselves after closing on our first home. We had to hire a plumber to install it ($400) due to the age of our home (1968) and how delicate our pipes are. However, it works great and we thoroughly enjoy it. My biggest complaint is the feminine wash. It doesn't align well, so I have to adjust myself to get clean. Also, the water heats inconsistently. It starts cold (understandable) but then gets comfortable. However, a few seconds later it's lukewarm or cold again. I am uncertain if this is due to the bidet or our tankless water heater.

Overall, I think we would buy it again, unless we could find one that aligns better.

Also, I wasn't able to find this information anywhere: the weight capacity for the TCB-8100W is 400 pounds."
"So the main problem is that when you press the remote it either does not work or works, then changes to another program or shuts off completely, that happens like every tenth time I use it. Kinda no big deal. Just press the button again…
Cleaning it isn't so easy I use an electric toothbrush and throw it away after. Thats a great tip (literally) for shower heads and whatever. But it gets junk in it. My water leaves scale and rust marks so I had to take this metal piece off because it gets all that stuff in it. No poo, It is “self cleaning” in that respect. But its a small hassle in the upkeep and remote department. For the price and what its worth, its a great product.
My girlfriend says its amazing during the “downtimes” of the month. I think it’s great and I wasn’t into it at all before purchasing. But I got it because I have a septic tank and it basically eliminates toilet paper. They say my tank should last another 20 years and before they said 5 years at max because I had an old system with some problems.
We go out to eat at places that are really nice and we wont poo like “cavemen” anymore, so we don't ever go to the bathroom out of the house.
It’s a life change. Imagine not washing your hands ever again after you go to the bathroom because its all automated!!!! You literally don’t use your hands. Like, use your phone, and no problem before or after. Lol.
I’ve had this over a year now."
"-------DISLIKES-------
1) The seat does NOT fit my round bowl, and I measured twice before purchasing!! Measure 3x in all directions before you purchase. Specifically, about 1"" of the bowl can be seen when you are sitting & looking between your legs. This is not hygienic. And yes - My VERY HANDY husband & I have already adjusted it per instructions as much as possible.
2) The feminine wash doesn't really go forward enough. I really have to skootch back. I guess, perhaps, I might be 'built' wrong - that might be a thing. I don't know. But I have to sit REALLY FAR BACK, and adjust the control REALLY FAR FORWARD.
3) The dryer is a bit hot, even on its coolest setting. This might just be me. My fat ass might be droopy & closer to the dryer than my husband's, as he has not complained. I am 235#, which is under the 260# weight limit - but yes, barely.
4) MINOR: This seat CAN NOT be cleaned with certain chemicals, or it voids the warranty. Bleach is one of the chemicals. I typically don't clean the SEAT with bleach, but I do clean the BOWL with bleach-products, and am now afraid. But this is minor since there are alternatives.
5) MINOR: Cannot sit on the seat when it's closed. I knew this when I bought it, but when I make my next purchase, I'll take this into consideration.
[For those who wish to comment on my imperfect bowl, weight, or droopy ass - my response is simply this: We cannot all be perfect, but I'm very happy that you are.]
-------LIKES-------
Overall, I'd buy it again. It's our family's first bidet, and for the price, it was a WONDERFUL choice. Even a high end, expensive one is going to have a tough act to follow. The Vovo VB4100-SR is comfortable to sit on, deodorizes, has pulsating AND temperature controls, and has a heated seat when you first sit down - no warm up needed. My husband has named it, despite his initial apprehension, and speaks to it saying things like, ""Yes, Mr ___. I have a deposit for you today."" I think it makes him more comfortable with the idea of spraying water up his wazoo."
I bought this bidet seat on sale for black Friday and I'm pretty happy with it. Several months back I got a cheap bidet that just attaches under your existing toilet seat and uses cold water. After using it I decided that I like using a bidet and that I'd like to upgrade to one of these fancy ones with a heated seat and heated water. I put several on my wish list and waited to see if one would drop under $200 for black Friday and Vovo was the one that did. I had a little trouble getting the seat to slide into the little tray attachment. I ended up taking the tray off and sliding it onto the seat so I could see how it went on. Once I actually saw how it attached I was able to figure out where I had been going wrong. So far I've had no issues with leaking and all I did was hand tighten the plumbing. The one thing I kind of wish I had noticed wasn't included in this bidet is the ability to remember your chosen settings for nozzle position and water pressure. Though honestly even if I had realized it didn't do that I probably still would have bought it because I was pretty set on my price. Having to re-enter my settings every time is a small annoyance but not enough to return it and pay possibly $100 more just for that feature. I've been using it about a week now and the heated seat alone was worth it. Is there anything more boujee than getting up on a cold winter's morning and sitting your tush down on a toasty warm toilet seat? The cleaning functions work well and it's so much nicer to get sprayed with warm water first thing in the morning than icy cold water. The blow dryer is useless but I already expected that from reading reviews on many different brands. For the sale price I paid I think it's a great value. If I had the budget to pay full price I think I would pay a little bit more and get one that remembers your settings.
"After 2 years, it’s stopped working properly but thanks to a responsive team I was able to get a working bidet. I wasn’t expecting much but I reached out and they took care of me! I gave 5 stars even though it initially broke because of the responsiveness and quick shipping of a replacement unit. I even got an elongated version that worked better at no extra fuss."
"Overall, I’m very happy with this purchase. Installation was easy with minimal tools. The seat gets incredibly warm and I keep mine on the lowest setting. There always seems to be enough warm water, and even without heating the water it’s not coming out shockingly cold. I appreciate that I can adjust the water pressure depending on my needs that day. The deodorizer actually does seem to help, and I love that it lights up the bowl, which is great at night when you’re exhausted in the middle of the night and don’t want to do your business in harsh lighting and then try to get back to sleep.

That said, there are a couple of points for improvement. The sizing is slightly off. I have an elongated toilet, but the seat sticks out much too far. You may not think an inch of space matters, but in a small bathroom, it does. It also positions you differently over the bowl, so keep your toilet brush handy or it’s going to look like a public toilet in Europe. The feminine spray - I can’t seem to position this correctly. Perhaps it’s my own anatomy, but I have to contort myself to clean properly. It s fine, but a bit annoying and could be more difficult for someone with limited mobility. Lastly, the dryer. While it can get hot enough to be uncomfortable, it takes forever to get completely dry because there isn’t enough air pressure, so youll still need to manually dry yourself.

Again, I am happy with the purchase. It was well packaged, easy to install, and leaves me feeling clean and fresh. My toilet paper consumption has gone down significantly (I still use a small amount for drying). I thought I’d be annoyed at the sloped seat cover, but I’m not. In fact, it keeps my kid from standing on it which is an unintended bonus. I would absolutely install one on every toilet in my house if I had more than one that we actually use."
"I feel like a Guinea pig but with the country going crazy for TP, I drew inspiration from how other countries have dealt with their bathroom sanitation. This is part of a 2 tier solution for me - the other part being ""cloth toilet paper "" to pat dry with after the spritz.
The installation took abt an hr for me. While I measured the holes and the length of the bowl, I didn't realize I was losing around 5 inches of space from the backside of the toilet. The length of my bowl is 16"" - so after losing 5 inches for the hinge and reservoir, your ""target zone"" is reduced. I am a female- this was not a problem. My husband, however, was not happy and complimented me on my new private bathroom. His issue is that he lost space to aim down for ""number 1"" while seated for the ""number 2."" Because of the smaller bowl size, the seat was on the cusp of fitting and was a booger to get it snapped into place on the mounting bracket.
I do like that it pretty much works as stated. Nothing works unless your cheeks set off the sensor, so no accidental water fountains. The fan/dryer is a little weak ( unless you hv time to wait 5+ mins), but again, after you're clean just pat dry with a washcloth. The LED and seat warmer are additional cool features. The only function I have yet to try is the ""Enema spray"" - we just met and I don't know if I'm ready to take my relationship ... there ....just yet. Overall, I'm happy with my purchase and recommended this product to family- however, I was unhappy to see in the less then 1 wk I placed the order, the price has jumped up an additional $50 - so boo on taking advantage of the pandemic.

My biggest take away is set this up on a toilet that's bigger then 17"" if you have a male in the household.

UPDATE 6-20-20:
I have a convert! My husband finally and begrudgingly admitted he likes the bidet.
😏"
"It stopped warming up seat and water after less than 6 months. For $300 i was expecting it to last a little bit longer.
*update* manufacturer sent replacement promptly and followed up for few weeks to make sure i got replacement unit and if it was working! Ella was wonderful and genuinely very caring and personable!"
"The unit works fine , heat , comfort ease of use . But there were a few things . First and by no means is this on the unit , design , or parts that came with it . But due to my existing toilet design i wasn't able to use the included 7/8-7/8 with 1/2 diverter .My hose makes the connection inside the tank . I had to get a 3/8-3/8 with a 1/2 diverter and connect it at the wall valve . Major hardware stores do not handle this and i had to order it online . I am mentioning this should anyone else find themselves in the same situation .
Now for my two little criticisms . First the 'Back lighting"" makes it nearly imposable to read the function buttons if the room is dim . Yes I don't like the bathroom to be fully light up sometimes at night to ease my eyes . ... but don't worry about what button does what as you will quickly learn to not to need to look at the control panel it . .
My second one is the air dryer but not for the same way most have been critical of it . the air is warm and the flow isn't that bad . the problem is the little flap door forces the air down and away from your back side .I simply removed the little door , and now it blows on me ! . if they were to have reversed the hinge on the other side it would force more air up and onto you...I would think someone would have thought about that before this point ."
"The toilet was easy to install. I knew the flushing might cause an issue because it is based on water pressure. This was a residential install and we are on city water, so I figured it had to be reasonable pressure, but I did not test it. The biggest issue is that the toilet paper does not always flush. If the flushing were a little better, on our water pressure, I would give it a 5 star."
"Just had it installed, quite simple and looks great. Hopefully it will be functional for a long time."
"Recently, I encountered an issue that I had purchased from your esteemed company, the T-value part might be broken and start to leak. Despite my initial frustration and uncertainty, your customer service department person named Natcha swiftly approached me to address my concerns and provide a solution. The level of support and assistance I received throughout the process was truly commendable. Thanks to your exceptional after-sales service, I now have a resolution to my problem. I can continue enjoying the benefits of your product/service.
Once again, I express my deepest gratitude for the outstanding service I received, and I will continue to recommend your company to my friends, family, and acquaintances based on my positive experience."
"I've had a bidet for a long time, but a recent inheritance have me the funds to afford this beauty. The first thing I'm going to tell you is to try the fittings before you decide they don't look like they fit and spend too much time and money fixing something you broke unnecessarily. Once I had her installed I was in love. Yes, in love with a toilet. The seat warmer? Thought I wouldn't use it because I live in Texas. I was wrong. It's wonderful and freakishly calming. The remote control is out of control bougie and I adore it. A word of caution - it is possible to overheat your nether regions. Definitely start on the lowest heat setting for the water and air. I do not regret this ultra bougie purchase even one tiny bit."
"This toilet is very sleek and space efficient. We love that the automatic flush is based on duration of how long one is seated (seat sensor( rather than motion. That was the one thing that would have concerned us about automatic flushing based on motion sensing is the premature flushing. If the seat is not used, just flush it manually. The bidet is loaded with features that differentiates between the male and female anatomy. Adjustment of the water sprayer (position and pressure) allows further customization. I gave it four star instead of five for the remote because it is rather bulky but really not a problem and is the most insignificant “issue.” Water temp, seat temp, and pressure settings take effect almost immediately. It is well built and feels/looks like a luxury fixture. We used a professional plumber for the installation so we cannot attest to whether is is easy for the DIY’er but the plumber we used have never installed one before and he had no trouble. The tankless physical setup makes it easy to clean, takes up less room, and no extended sound of water filling up a tank. Highly recommend this product."
"Product is great; however, i've installed several toilets and bidets in my time and could not successfully install this one. Even the plumbing company I hired took a week to find the part needed to connect it to the 3/8ths valve on the wall and they had to drive over an hour to a store in another town to get the parts needed. The parts the plumbing company ended up using to get it up and running were for an airline compressor valve which added an extra 12 inches of metal to the valve on the wall."
The 3way connection I received is for a 7/8 connection and that is not normal for a us connection. 1/2 inch or 3/8 I would understand. So once arrive I had to order an additional part. No response after two days to customer service!! So I paid 400 bucks for a regular toilet seat!!
"very good bidet toilet seat. seat warmer works fantastically and fits well on my toilet, the only problem i have is the water temp goes from warm to cold to warm again. id suggest putting the water temp on the highest so you don't end up getting a cold surprise."
"All the bidet features of this toilet are great. However, the seat itself is very uncomfortable. It quickly cuts the circulation in your legs. Honestly, its the most uncomfortable toilet seat I ever sat on.
(Public toilets included)

It’s a shame, because, for the price you would expect it to ergonomically designed for comfort. They seemingly spent more time on bidet features than actually considering the basic comfort of actually sitting on it.

Hopefully in future they will release some kind of padded (or even just correctly molded) seat that could be changed out, in order to avoid a complete reinstall of the whole toilet."
"The control part came broken, had to return."
"I'm so happy, I bought a 2nd one with the kid feature.
Definitely use plumbers tape on the inside of the threads and tighten it with a wrench. I seen on another review, some dumb@$$ wrapped the outside of the hose connection with plumbers tape 🤦‍♀️😂.

My 1st attempt was hand tightened with no tape. 😂 I was sprayed.
This is my 1st bidet seat experience. Before I was using squirt bottles. To see if I was ready to ditch the nasty tp before committing with a pricy seat. I loved the squirt bottle but it was annoying to do the pee pee dance while waiting for the warm water to fill it. At night I didn't want to use cold water down there.
I can only seem to stand the lowest spray setting, bc ouch. It has some serious pressure. The squirt bottle was way too gentle by comparison.
I can't tell the difference between ""feminine"" and ""posterior"". I have to lean forward to spray my girl parts with both settings. I thought the nozzle would rotate or give a different type of spray. Like a wide flat spray for the girl feature.
I'm not a fan of the heated seat. Bc it heats up after you sit down. The heated water on demand is the main purpose for my purchase. The led light is cool but haven't used it much. I installed it yesterday (12/24/2020)."
"I had a problem with the install only because my fill pipe was a solid tube. I needed to replace it with a flexible line. Not the companie's fault.
I like it. It does what it says.
A few people complained about the wand not retrieving all the way. I have not had that happen but there is a sensor on the seat so that it will stop if you are not sitting on it. I have only been using it for a few days and so far I am satisfied with the purchase. I will update my review after I have used it for a while.
update 7/11/20: If you are expecting a one button wash, rinse and dry, you will be disappointed. Each cycle take about 60 seconds. The only operation that works when there is no weight on the seat is the nozzle clean. you need to press once to extend and a second time to retract. I use 3 cycles on the wash, 2 on the dry. Gets me clean but not dry. I press the nozzle clean twice when I am standing. works great. If you have ever replaced a toilet seat and hooked up a garden hose, you can handle the installation. water temperature can change during use but never runs out. I intend to buy a second one to use in Florida.
Update 8/25
Flush before using dryer.
Use paper to blot not wipe.
I fold 5 or 6 sheets in half, then half again. If I'm clean I dry with a towel."
"The unit had some minor issues and the team was able to tech-support it live using Apple™ iPhone® FaceTime® and we were easily able to reset the unit on the spot. The product itself is VERY high quality and again the support team is THE BEST I have experienced on ANY product I have owned.

VERY SATISFIED CONSUMER!"
Great product and super easy installation! I highly recommend this product.
"I’ve recently had 3 of these toilets installed in my home. They all work fabulously. Every feature works as advertised. The bidet water heats to whatever temperature chosen very quickly as do the seat and dryer features. The purple UV light is great for nighttime illumination.

As far as customer service is concerned, this company is very attentive. One of the bidets was having an issue with flushing twice. I contacted the company via email and got a very quick response. A service technician contacted me, we connected via FaceTime, and were able to open the top of the bidet portion, switch a single connection, and now it works perfectly. They were more than willing to send me a brand new one had the repair not worked. I would recommend these toilets and this company to everyone."
"Like Everything about this bidet. Easy to install, took me 20 minutes from start to end, I surprised my husband! Eventhough the instructions do not say to use Teflon Tape aka Plumbers tape it is best to use it to create a tight water seal on threaded pipes/comnections.
Pay attention to the measurements as indicated in listing. I purchased the Elongated seat. It does do all as stated on listing. Just love not having to worry about toilet paper shortage! Love the clean feeling! Definitely recommend this. I didn't want one with a remote because eventually it would end up lost somewhere and I despise being stuck with products without the remotes then become limited in operating or even worst you have to buy a replacement remote.

Cons: I don't like the feel of the toilet seat cover. It feels a bit flimsy. The self closing hinges durability concern me.

Suggestions:
▪1》 I would think that with all the technology, bells and whistles these bidets bring that they would be equipped with sensors to open and close automatically. Perhaps yhis manufacturer can benefit from this review. Would gladly test and review.

▪2》 The LED light would be nice to be able to select a different color perhaps a blue or purple with dimming capabilities. This would help for night view.

This is my NEGATIVE comment. I purchased this item 2 weeks ago and now it is $105.00 dollars more. Sellers Should Not be Allowed to gouge their prices Capitalizing on the Pandemic.
Amazon should put a stop to this kind of activity."
"Life changer! My husband and I love our bidet seat!

The remote is easy to use and has lots of functions. Love the seat warmer and variable water temps. Has plenty of positions for the sprayer so each user can get it just right. The sprayer also rinses itself after each use which is nice and feels more hygienic. I had some friends over and they all wanted one after using!

Water temperature is usually great although sometimes it gets cool if you keep the spray going for a long time. It’s never enough to bother us though. Fan isn’t great, takes 5 minutes or so to get dry, but not a huge draw back. I do wish the spray was wider, I think that would be better for the lady bits.

We had tough time installing it unfortunately, the t valve leaked and it’s difficult to find a replacement (not carried at hardware stores). But with a little ingenuity it worked out fine.

All in all if we wanted to spend another $500 we could have gotten the perfect bidet, but given our budget this is a really great product! I highly recommend!"
"I bought this product as a gift for my parents and sent it to them. At first, I was worried that they would not be able to use the bidet, because they had never used a bidet.

However, after looking at the manual and following it, my parents said it was much easier to use than they expected.

Since the toilet seats are different for each brand, I was also worried about the size of the bidet. However, even though the bidet is a little bigger than my parents' toilet seat, the bidet seat is wider, so the feeling is much better. Unlike other reviews, we had no size problems.

Rather, the bathroom was more luxurious, so they were satisfied.

Also, the existing toilet seat is a bit heavy and hard to open and close, but the lid of this product is light and easy to open and close gently.

Finally, my mother said that the deodorizing function is more satisfying than she expected. She said that when using a bidet, the deodorizing function automatically works, and the smell disappears immediately.

Since this is a gift for my parents, so I compared various famous brands before I made my purchase.

However, even though this is the new brand, the design and functionality seem to be better than other brands! Overall, I think I bought a good quality product at a lower price.

My parents are so happy that I highly recommend this product!"
"Ordered this seat and had it installed. A couple of details seem to be left out of the install procedure, so to make it easier for others...
1: When you put the base plate on the toilet, the sloped edge goes to the front.
2: If you only manage to clip one side of the seat on to the base plate (it's fiddly), don't panic! There is a release on the right hand side of the lid that releases the clip and you can pull the seat off and re-position it. You don't have to undo the screw and nuts holding the whole base plate in position, which takes several minutes.
Ask me how we found out..!
As a bidet seat, the key is to get the water temperature set, not only the seat temperature, but also the spray temperatures and the pressure of the water sprays, all of which you set via the remote control. This is no different from any other bidet seat, but someone has to be the tester! Once set though, it works great and the water is at the right temperature every time.
Only negative observation is that the seat was a little larger than the bowl, but that's my issue with an old toilet bowl I think. The other very minor issue I had is that the slight slope of the seat takes a little to get used to. It's small but noticeable for the first couple of days, but after that you get used to it."
"I measured prior to order, and specs said I needed elongated (which I already knew). My toilet was 18.5” from holes to the end of the bowl…you can see from the pic that the seat, isn’t actually 18.5” as it says. So my toilet has an “underbite” LOL However, It works pretty well, not hardly as well as I would’ve liked, BUT am happy w the price I paid ($249) for the quality of product. For those of you who might have a need to sit on the lid for some reason, the lid is plastic & wouldn’t support such.
I like the remote control & the fact that it’s easy to use. I wish the seat fit the bowl better & the cord was longer so that I wouldn’t have to use an extension cord, as 99.9% of people don’t have an outlet behind their toilets."
"This was our upgrade from the add on seat. In the end it was well worth great toilet lots of ability to adjust. The remote is kinda big but it mounts so it's really of no consequence. One thing to know is the lead water pipe to the toilet is a unique item and short. You can see in my photo the water out line, that's too far for the unique water line, so we needed an adapter. I called the company and they were honestly amazing. Sent extra parts free of charge, even got on camera to show me ""how"". Very happy."
"The bidet toilet arrived very quickly. The technical support was super helpful when addressing my issue. The replacement part came very fast and the support team took the time to resolve the issue and educate me on the bidet functionality.
I will highly recommend the toilet with bidet, they are very modern looking in my bathroom especially the tankless design."
"I had the Vovo TCB 8100W professionally installed a few months ago and wonder how I lived without it!
The design has elevated my bathroom remodel. The remote is easy to use with customizable settings and the unit is very easy to clean and care for.
Last week I noticed some issues with the spray nozzle and emailed customer support and received a super fast response with contact info for their local technician. Kevin was an absolute joy to work with. He helped me trouble shoot via FaceTime then, just to be sure that the issue was completely resolved, drove to my home on the same day!
The customer support and product knowledge is above and beyond and I will definitely order another unit for my next remodel."
"Works as advertised.....I like the ultraviolet light feature, keeps my bowl clean from bacteria growth."
"I ordered two of these, believed the only difference was Elongated vs. Round. Not so. There are some subtle differences between them, ranging from the fiberglass reinforced supply on one vs. the stainless steel included with the other. Also how they work is not completely the same, and the round one was inconsistent in its behavior until we lost power once and when it came back on, the seat functioned as expected. Sitting on the lid isn't recommended, so I limit how much I do it, but I do sit on it and it seems a bit flimsy for that, but works and I'm no longer a light person..... I had TWO shoulder surgeries, actually NEEDED a bidet seat, and due to mobility, needed a remote. Works well, I don't know how I never had one of these before."
"Hi Shoppers,

I bought 4 of the bidet toilet seat VB-4100SR weighs 12bls. from Vovo, and I love it. It has cleaning for front and back, fan to dry, hot water, hot seated, you can control the pressure of wash and overall I love the Anema option which help you to relieve bowl and best thing is there is no tissue papers to wipe or water to wash for those who manually wash. I recommend this product, it is rigid and easy to install. Above all, Vovo offers courtesy replacement in most cases and cordial Customer Service - 5 STARTS"
"Intermittent electrical failure.
Everything else was comfy
Wife liked the front wash
EDIT: Vovo reached out and a replacement is on the way.
Wife is happy again. Thank you Vovo!"
"Stylement 400:
I have returned the item a month ago after trying it for a day . The sole reason I bought it is the enema function. But the pressure isn’t strong enough compared with my decade old ADM. As good as the aesthetic and other functions, I had to return it.
I had contacted Amazon about the refund and was told the time line of 2 weeks after receiving. According to ups the return was received by Amazon a month ago and yet no refund was received, except the notice” refund has started”
What’s the delay? The item was returned in perfect condition sun everything intact ; I only tried the enema function without actually “doing the deed”."
"With the onset of COVID-19 and the mass shortage of toilet paper everywhere (even trusty Amazon), we decided that it was the perfect time to invest in a bidet. We had heard great things about it and that once you installed one, you wouldn’t regret it. To be honest, I was a little hesitant to pull the trigger because of the price tag because it seemed like a lot for, well a toilet seat cover it seemed. But my husband and I decided if we were going to buy one, we wanted to make sure it was something that was aesthetically pleasing and had all the functions we wanted.

After about a week of having installed it and using it, I can honestly say I don’t know why we didn’t make the switch sooner. My husband said installation was a breeze and it fits perfectly on our seat after going by the measurements listed. I love all the functions and the remote control is sleek and easily mounted on the wall.

If you’re looking for a bidet that’s worth it, and you want a great quality product, I recommend this one 100%!"
"I had an issue with remote not being able to work as intended, contacted customer support and April helped resolve the problem. It did fix for once but now the remote doesn’t work and too many multination for toilet this price. they supported to extend the product warranty which is nice but wouldn’t recommend to purchase…The toilet is fine for the price but material is a bit flimsy."
"This is my second automatic toilet and better than what I expected.
I used to have a bidet about ten years ago. I enjoyed it but color of the plastic nozzle had been changed after about a year and I felt the nozzle was contaminated. so, I didn’t want to use the bidet anymore.

However, it was hard to buy the toilet papers since the COVID-19 pandemic, so I decided to buy a bidet once more, and this time I was looking for the bidet with a stainless steel nozzle only. Seems likes the stainless steel nozzle is more hygienic than the plastic one.

This bidet is a lot fancier than I used have. Compared to other bidet with a plastic nozzle, this is little expensive, but it worth it. The setup was not difficult. I really love 3 levels of heated seat. The only problem is staying on the toilet longer than before.

Both my husband am I love it and we feel clean after using it and now cannot imagine going back to using just toilet paper & wipes!!

I highly recommend this bidet to everyone."
"I have never owned a bidet before and had no idea what it was (I'm a male). Upon installing this unit I found that my beliefs in electronics from other devices was useless here. DO NOT think this is going to respond as quickly as other electronic devices. I began by pressing a number of buttons on the remote and discovered it didn't like that very much. If you have a modicum of patience, this is a wonderful thing. Give it time to respond to your last command before pressing another button on the remote. If you allow it to function at it's own pace, it will respond to you.
I agree with other reviews that it doesn't fully retract all the time, but, most times. Other times it just ""quits"" before finishing the last command (guess it's tired). Just ""Stop"" and begin again... If you can live with these quirks, then, this is the unit for you....."
"This should be a five stars product but the remaining star has given to Amazon. This product (Korean made) overall is a very good quality product except their QA need to step up some more. The nozzle was not able to retract after 2 weeks of usage and the warranty coverage required me to send it back which cost approx. $50 and will take at least 2-3 weeks for the replacement. Since I bought it from Amazon, there is no problem to return it with a replacement which cost me $0 and the replacement was arrived in 3 days. The replacement so far is working perfectly. That's why I have concluded that it is just a QA issue and not the product itself."
"11-2023, Update.
The heated seat issue has not been resolved. Spoke to the company many times...I'm giving up.
Now a new issue has come up, the remote is not functioning. Replace NEW batteries, and still not working. The side ""control panel"" is functioning. Now what?

I love almost everything, and am considering buying two more of these bidet seats. However, I'll be looking for another brand because the heated seat feature, which I love, turns itself off! So, midnight trips to the toilet can be quite uncomfortable when the heated seat isn't heated! And when the heat is off, I feel like I'm sitting on a frozen seat!
I purchased the seat in Sept. 2020. Because of this heated seat issue, and after speaking to the customer service dept., I am now on my 3rd seat! They have replaced quickly and are helpful. However, as I've tried to get this issue resolved, they have told me that no one has this issue! I just read a review that indicates that it has happened to another person. So, has anybody else out there that has this seat had this issue??"
"WE LOVE YOU ROBOT TOILET! TOTAL GAME CHANGER. SOO nice and half the price of the next one with this quality and that one had been on sale and still twice the price. The only difference between that next price up was a deodorizer. This followed through with my research and I am not disappointed, above and beyond my expectations. Buttons are great. I love that it has the remote attached, easy wipe down, looks beautiful, air dry is warm, water is warm, easy installation, seat is warm, erfect pressure level, love that I can adjust the pressure to comfort level, amazing! Never want to be with out it or this brand, definitely gained my trust and my loyalty. Me and my husband, love it! Thank you! And thank you for the price. Save us on shower water, makes us feel clean. Love it! Can't say that enough. Thabknyou for the quality product at an affordable price for every household."
"I was a bit skeptical at first buying a bidet...but after trying it, I cant believe i've spent my life without one. This unit has all the features you could ever want...Hot water, heated seat, and the unit was incredibly easy to install. I would recommend this unit to anybody! If I could give the quality, installation and customer service team more stars I would!!! A great company to do business with!"
"Updated: Vovo kindly reached out and provided a replacement which has thus far performed adequately. I still don't feel the quality of spray is as good as my previous Toto device, but still a nice clean. And the bowl night light is a nice touch.

Very much regret purchasing this after having a toto. It's an inferior product in just about every way. It randomly doesn't work, then will be stuck on hot water temperature. Sometimes unplugging and plugging in will reset it, but other times I'm just stuck with toilet paper. Really quite a garbage product, even when working, the spray quality is not nearly a good as i was used to with my previous Toto.

Problem of not working keeps getting worse, downgrading to 1 star."
"I had to have reverse shoulder replacement of my right arm. Knowing it would be at least three months before I could ""wipe"" again, I ordered this bidet to get me through. I must say, I'm spoiled! How did I go 70 years without this? (Abit, it wouldn't have done much good in the old outhouses of my childhood. There was a TV show called 'The Untouchables', we called the outhouses, ""The Unflushables"")!!
About two months into the use, the nozzle developed a small drip. Upon calling the company, they got out a brand new bidet and a prepaid shipping label for return of the dripping one. I just couldn't see going through the rest of my life without this! The French and other Europeans certainly knew something that North Americans don't. NO more toilet tissue shortages around here!!"
"I love it. I tried this product at a friend's house and figured I need one too. Heated seat in Minessota winter is so nice. Warm water cleaning also. The remote is cool, and it's nice as you don't need an electical outlet right next to the toilet it can be connected with an extension cord. I love how I can use the toilet during night without turning the lights on and waking my dogs attention in the middle of the night. This highly recomended for all people living in cold areas who need this heated seat for life quality enhancement!

UPDATE*
Now I’ve been using this product for a few weeks and I wanted to add on how the item is so easy to use and straightforward. The wireless remote functions were as described, just push to operate. The nozzle cleaning was also very convenient and easy to use! Overall, the product itself is very easy to use and more satisfying after using it for a while!"
"For those who want the best bathroom luxury, we recommend choosing the VOVO VB4100SR electronic bidet toilet seat. It's more expensive than the other products we've found, but it offers top-of-the-line features and almost unmatched performance.

Until recently, I had no idea it was possible to add a bidet to my existing toilet without a plumber. It is easy to install, simple to use, and will give you extra levels of comfort and hygiene in your bathroom. This bidet has many features, such as different types of cleaning mode, heated seat, heated water, air dryer, and Nightlight. I will start by saying that I have been aware of the health and sanitary benefits of using water instead of dry paper to clean your backside.

It may be one of the more expensive options, but it is a luxurious and upscale toilet for those who demand the best. If you try it once, you will never go back to the old bathroom again."
Warm water and seat are fabulous. Power wash comes in handy.
"Install was a breeze, I will say the bolts were a bit odd but fit snug finally. After that snap and connect the inlets and you are on your way to new experiences. I will say the pressure control is very nice as the water pressure on this thing can reach into the depths of dwarven caves and leave with all the treasure. Think of a pressure washer, for those who have never used a bidet, at the highest setting and a light water fountain at the low setting. Somewhere in the middle will work. My wife found the adjustable water sprayer handy to reach areas she needed. I like the fan and it does really well to dry.

Con- The remote is giant. I mean it looks like the cable remote from the 90's, big boxy and chunky. The beeps and boops are really loud too.

Pros - We feel WAY cleaner. Seriously it is night and day."
"It is an awesome toilet!! The design fits to my bathroom decor to perfection. The auto flush and heated seat is a must now. Also, this unit comes with UV purple light as well so that is an great to have. With the price, design and function, I cannot fault the unit in a slightest. I installed this toilet in our master bathroom but now, I'm gonna put this one for the other bathroom to stop all my kids to come here and use this one."
Got a full refund. Very honorable.
"Been wanting to ditch the toilet paper and move towards a more environmentally friendly bathroom and this was the first step. Easy to install, however, there is a slight difference in the sizes of this and the elongated US toilet. Not a deal breaker, maybe because of the tank in the back it has to sit a little forward than the regular seat. So far everything is working great, we installed this in a new bathroom in the basement which tends to get cold and so appreciate the heated seat! :) I am already plotting replacing the master bath regular seat with this, but will have to drop a power-outlet first. Full disclosure, its still brand new, less than a week since installed."
"This thing is amazing. I am a new woman. I told my husband we could still be married, but we would have to get to know each other again. He is similarly in awe of this device. Do you want a toilet experience that is easy, relaxing, and stress free? Look no further. Have a robot servant tend to your nether regions.

The water comes out nice and warm. The dryer gets pretty hot at its highest setting, rock gently from side to side and to/fro for best results.

Be brave, try the enema function. Ladies and gents, have you ever had a toilet reach inside you and gently pull out a turd? It’s like Poseidon himself has carefully extracted all the refuse from your body in one fell swoop.

Just be careful to measure your toilet before buying. That seems to be the only tricky aspect to this. Installation is easy but does require an outlet near the toilet."
"I love this bidet, I just hope it lasts. I purchased it for the enema function which is awesome. I highly recommend it for elderly people or anyone who has constipation problems. It definitely saves on toilet paper. I bought the round seat model which others have noted overextends the front a little. I don't mind because I think that it might actually give more support so the seat may not crack as others have complained about other bidets. We had to buy a few different connections from Lowe's to complete the installation but everything worked out okay and it was well worth the trouble. I wish I'd done this years ago."
"This is the third bidet we've purchased. I was so surprised how light it is. Two other bidets we've had are almost twice as heavy. The design is sleek and modern.
The installation process was very simple because the instructions were very easy to follow. We don't have an outlet in the restroom so my husband connected an extension cord to the light switch panel.
The seat is also very comfortable. I constantly wake up in the middle of the night to use the bathroom and the seat is always so warm and nice. Especially in this hard time we can limit our usage on toilet paper. It is controlled by a remote control which is very convenient. Overall , I'm glad I purchased this bidet and would highly recommend to others. And once we can afford it we are going to replace all of the other toilets in the house with this bidet."
"It was easy to install.
My wife loves once it installed on our bathroom next to master bedroom."
This was expensive but one of the best purchases I have made. It makes a bathroom trip a much better experience. It cleans itself (for the most part) . The features are great and I use all of them. As a person who has never used a bidet before I would highly recommend this product.
We’ve had this for almost a month and we absolutely love it. The water comes out warm everytime and the remote responds well. If you don’t have some plumbing experience I would hire a professional to make the connections. The metal T valve doesn’t connect well with plastic toilet connections and it leaked so I had to hire a plumber to do it right. It’s worth it!
"VOVO has great product and customer service.
Aside from all the nice functions like automatic flush and bidet, they also provide great customer service. I usually do not leave review here but now, I have to. They were so responsive with great support. Now, I have a wonderful toilet and I 100% recommend this unit to any one. My bathroom experience will not be the same without my vovo toilet."
"This bidet had been working great. We recently had an issue with this product so I sent an email to see what could be done to help resolve it. Natcha replied within an hour, offering advice on how to solve the issue. When that didn't work, Natcha sent a replacement without hesitation. Received replacement today. So very happy with the service and the commitment Vovo has in their products. I haven't experienced this level of service in quite some time."
"I have been using it since 2020, and very much satisfied with its overall performance. It saves use of toilet paper, helping green revolution."
"This is our second bidet seat. Wife took the first, which was a round front. Not enough room for a guy. I have had this elongated one 6 months now. I have wanted to give a great review for months now. This unit is solid, and has all the features I would want. I didn't know if the deodorizer was just a gimmick but it actually really works! Highly recommend this unit."
"This is a very good bidet. All of the functions work as described. I was able to install it in 20 minutes without any tools. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because the round toilet seat is bigger than a round bowl. So much so that I have to check the model number to ensure they sent me the right one, which they did. I measured everything in advance, but the seat is still too big. This isn't a big deal; it just doesn't look as nice as it would if it fit the seat. Other than that, it works great!"
I like how it functions however it's a headache to clean the nozzle that is supposed to be self cleaning still requires some cleaning and in cleaning it today my nozzle will now not go back into its housing I'm looking to talk to the manufacturer but don't see a way on how to contact them
"Hope the U.S. figures out what benefits a bidet gives. And, if you buy one with terrific customer service, such as Kevin at VoVo, you'll be as happy as I am. Recuperating from surgery, my bidet makes it easier and Kevin put my mind at ease and guided me through the steps to get my bidet on its way. Love it.

Paula"
I love it! The operating instructions can be better...
"Overall Good product, but there is minor sensor issue about kid detection"
"This model has a lot of features that are typically seen in more expensive bidets. Major highlights are the heater seat and water temperature controls. The heated seat is an especially welcome feature in the winter. The biggest weakness is the dryer. The fan is very weak and is practically useless, so don't count on avoiding toilet paper completely."
"Great Quality. We replaced an older one with this.
This one is much nicer!"
The remote is easy to control. Installation wasn't too bad had to call maintenance man to upgrade old pipes.
"So far, no complaint, we are all satisfied"
"The warm water runs cold if I let it go all the way until it stops. It does have a feature to stop the water sooner so that's what I do. It's winter here and cold in my house. That is my only complaint. Install was a cinch! I am very happy with all the features. It's not the best looking design, but I'm rating price and function over form."
"This is an exceoloent, east to install unit. My one concern is the control unit which is fabricated of plastic and attached to the right side of the unit. If a user, such as a guest, were to put any pressure on this part I fear it would easily break off rendering the entire unit useless."
My husband was having issues with hemmoriods and i wasnt sure that i would like one of these . After tons of research this is my first one ever and how do I like it I love it.....its seat is heated so its always warm...and washing instead of wiping i feel so much cleaner its nice heated water. why did i not buy one of these years ago....and it has made my husband feel so much better it has helped him tons i seriously recommend this one if you are considering get one you will not regret it....
"This is a real game changer. Since me and my wife went to Japan on vacation that we've been wanting to have one of these. It was fairly easy to install and it includes everything you need for it.
All the functionalities work as expected and water pressure and temperature control come in very handy. I don't give it 5 stars only because it doesn't fit that well on a round toilet, but still good enough."
"This bidet changed my life. The settings are on it are great, it really cleans you good. I was on the fence between this or a TOTO and I am glad I went with this. When I purchased it it was a bit cheaper than TOTO's but I believe the price went up a bit. That said I still thinks its cheaper if you do a feature comparison.

The only thing I would say is a bit lackluster is the dryer feature. Not because of a design issue, but its just better to get a lil wipe. =)

Also big shout out to VOVO, they sent me a bathroom deodorizer and a thank you letter following my purchase!"
Loved al.ost everythin g about it. The only problem was no usable electric plug close enough so had to ha e someone install that.but it works great.
"I have used this bidet seat since early 2021 and like its features. The only issues were I could not adjust the sprayer so it would cover the shorter distance I wanted. Also the drier was too close and felt hot so I didn't use it. I wrote up a review and two weeks ago, the company contacted me to send me a new replacement which I have just installed. The old seat slides off using the gray release button on the side so the new one was easy to mount. Clearly, this is a company that is working to improve its product and stands behind it!"
"This is my first bidet. Oh! How peasants live! was the exclamation by a girl on tiktok on her first use of bidet. I concur. I thought automatic ice dispenser was it. Nope, bidet. You haven’t lived if you don’t have a bidet.

My tiny apartment has round toilet. Turns out most Americans enjoy luxurious elongated toilet. That limited my choice of bidet. I ended up with Vovo. What a deal. This has features that you have to spend $400 for. Heated seat, UV Sanitation, butt dryer, pulsating water spray. 3 separate water nozzle. All controllable with a Remote! What a luxury.

My first seat on a warm seat was too luxurious.. makes you wonder did I make it in life and this is it. Warm water pulsating on my ass. To finish with warm air in chilly California Winter at sub 60 temperature outside. Priceless.. or least I heard it cost $39 for a session..

The seat has hole which is slightly square but it seems to provide slightly larger hole to work with and it is comfortable to seat on. Installation was simple even though I had issue connecting it to fill valve. Tee would strip the bottom of fill valve. I took fill valve out and fitted it and it just screwed on flawlessly. Reinstalling the fill valve afterward was flawless. Any mature males should be able to install it. Maybe some immature ones. It fits my round American Standard toilet perfectly.

Only feature it is short on is instant hot water feature. But I do not have issue at all of using spray continuously 3 times on one seating. I don’t get cold water.. so don’t be worried about that. Dryer did not blow stinky air. Air didn’t smell.

With all that feature I didn’t realize it is using twice the microwave. It can consume 1200 watt to pump out all those heated features. But you wont be seating on it much long. I will do a power consumption test with a watt meter. For example, seat was always warm which leads me to believe it maybe an always on feature so I turned it off. Water tank may consume electricity to maintain certain temperature so instant heater feature maybe more thrift feature but they will require some test. All the comfort of bidet is provided by electricity. Otherwise all you need is just a water hose for $20.

I have been only using for a week. Started seating on it for gentle wash in the morning. What a way to start a day. Clean ass!

Highly recommended. At this price they are giving it away because the company just love you. Be greedy and install it on all your toilet."
"This contemporary rectangular style with a wide comfortable seat has been what I tried VERY hard searching for in the last decade unsuccessfully, so, I had to settle getting the Kohler & Toto smart toilets in the few properties I bought. They annoy me in their ugly, typical elongated looks @ NYC apartments as well as feel very uncomfortable bc of the narrow surfaces. Through these yrs, around 30+ hrs of searching, owning & trying all those conventional brands I hate more & more, I was instantly drawn to the Vovo toilet @ Amazon thinking “YEAH, finally, a stylish & logical design is available”! The latest property I bought, as usual, I wanted to upgrade to be an intelligent toilet & my investor insisted of getting either the Kohler Eir ($7,600) or Veil ($6,000) that I hated the elongated look again. Due to the pandemic, the delivery times for these were a few months later that would have delayed the remodeling completion that we can’t have. So, I was desperate & started to search even in Amazon which has not been the place I would get toilets from. I was beyond thrill when I came across the Vovo chic look & even happier bc it only costs a fraction of what I was about to invest in.

The look fits NYC apt much better & a statement of an unique taste like faucets, tiles & appliances. However, I never heard of this brand & worried of the quality & customer service support, therefore ordered two as a trial. It was a gamble bc a few friends said a Korean brand might not be as reliable as Kohler, but, for the look, I went w/ my heart.

So when my contractor informed me one broke upon opening the box, I was greatly disappointed & the anxiety level came right back. Fortunately upon reporting it, this heavy replacement arrived in a few days from the west coast to the east coast that was impressive bc a few other construction materials I had ordered were delayed in shippings. The quick customer service made me had more confident in the brand & was relieved.

However, three months later, I was troubled by the leak behind one of the toilets thinking “screwed, my money down the drain” from an unknown brand i & friends feared. So, I contacted the vender as recommended by Amazon customer service thinking it would be a tough battle making them honor their product since it is expensive to ship the heavy & bulky box. To my surprise, the customer service Nacha immediately apologized & said she will send me right away the top piece that my contractor think might be the cause of the leak. She said if the leak still happens after the replacement, she will send me a new bowl too. Her assurance that the company will stand behind the product & delivered as promised were very impressive.

Both return labels came right away & shippings at their cost. Both times, the replacement products came quickly. The top replacement piece stopped the leak behind the toilet just like what I was hoping for.

Then, I was puzzled by small subtle bubble marks on the right surfaces, I contacted Nacha & she had the engineer call me in 2 hrs to explain the cause of the metal sending heat to the plastic contact creating these marks that I think hardly anyone would notice. His explanation was logical & I was fine with the explanation. He went further trying to assure me that it was not a defect & that there is a one yr warranty on it that they will stand by.

The people in this company were SO impressive, professional & courteous that I will certainly buy from them again & recommend to people.

If you are like me battling whether to gamble on this brand that is much lesser known than Kohler, Toto,…., my experience hopefully can help you decide. For the look, quality & bargain price, this 5 stars product is one you would enjoy looking @ & using. It is a great saving you could “sit on” & feel the satisfaction everyday! 😆 😆 👍 👍 👍"
"Let me get this out of the way first: I like this toilet. I'm glad I got it, even though I paid more for this than I ever thought I would pay for a toilet. The remote works well, it heats the air, water, and seat very nicely. The sensors seem to work pretty well. And we have yet to manage to stop it up (in a family of five with this as the main toilet). Also, the bidet portion of it is very adjustable and works well.

But one advertised feature is false, and another item mentioned online in some places and in the manual is also not entirely accurate. Before I go on, I would like to note that I really just am dinging the star to try to insure that the manufacturer updates the ad, and then I would happily move this to five stars:

First the false claim: This toilet claims to have a deodorizer. It does not. It has a thin piece of plastic with holes in it that the manual claims is a deodorizer. But it's just a thin piece of plastic that has holes in it. And in the manual, the only recommendation for maintenance of this thing is to wash it now and then. This is NOT a deodorizer. As I've said, it's simply a piece of plastic with holes in it. I'm guessing the real functionality of this thing is to prevent water from splashing into the vent.
Second item that is mentioned here and there, but I notice was not advertised on the Amazon page for this: The LED light that ""Subtlety illuminates"" the toilet is one of those purple ones that some companies love to claim is a UV light that can sterilize surfaces. In advertisements elsewhere, and even in the manual for this, they claim that this can help sterilize the toilet. Well, it's just a purple LED light. Real UV that can sterilize things uses MUCH shorter wavelengths. Not that I care that much. The light is kind of nice to look at and I'm not sure how helpful ""sterilizing"" the bowl of a toilet would be anyway, all things considered.
There is one other issue: If you get the model with the automatic toilet seat, it can be a bit confusing. It will let you lift and lower it with your hand where you give it a little nudge, and then it takes over. But if you nudge it too much, it can get a little out of sync, and it may not work properly for a couple of tries. For example, it may not raise all the way up. Helping it a few times by hitting the remote for the seat and using your hand to help the seat to the position it should be in can fix this. You can prevent this problem by always using the remote instead of moving it with your hands. Also, one time the seat just got stuck. It acted like it wanted to stay in one place. I powered it off and back on and that fixed the problem.

With all of that said, I really like this thing. The toilet appears to use sensors built into the actual seat to determine if a full size butt is sitting on it or not, and it won't activate the bidet if your kids play with the controls while no one is sitting on it, or if your four year old is sitting on it and curious about that feature (sorry little one, you'll have to wait until your butt is a bit bigger). The seat can be adjusted from mildly warm to real toasty, as can the air and water. The butt fan (dryer?) is not overly strong, as mentioned elsewhere, and you will probably go through some toilet paper drying yourself off, but it's still a bit improvement over using the TP like you normally would. Also, if you get the powered seat, it can raise and lower both the seat itself and the lid. There is also an auto flush, but it only works for sit down events, not standing ones.

One other feature I don't recommend using, if you have it in a bathroom with a shower: it has a setting where it can auto raise the lid for you as you approach (if you have the automatic toilet seat). But if you have people going in there just to use the shower, it may creep them out a bit when it suddenly opens as they walk by. You can turn that off, so no biggy.

Keep in mind that you will need an outlet near the toilet. But don't do what I did and think you are clever by installing a socket right behind the toilet so no one can see it. Because the next time you try to unplug the toilet (in case it needs a ""reboot"", which I've had to do once), you will realize you can't. Because it's hidden behind the toilet.

This is turning into a novel, so close up by saying that I really do like the toilet, and it helped me get past my fear of using a bidet. Just don't count on the deodorizer.

Edit: It's been over a year and the toilet continues to perform well. I am concerned about the auto opening lid motor, as it seems like it could be a failure point (due to the amount of stress there must be on the gear/motor mechanism contained in a pretty small area), but thus far I have had no issues (except for the very occasional reset I have to perform when someone forcibly moves the lid in a way that the toilet is not expecting). The one other issue I have, and it might just be because of my particular biology: Occasionally the bidet spray is somewhat painful, like it is hitting a sensitive spot a little too hard. Perhaps that is just me having sensitive spots on occasion, so I'm not going to ding it for that. I'll provide an update if I run into any issues. But I'm still pretty happy with the purchase."
"Bought this as a replacement for our first bidet seat that only worked for 4 days. This one's has worked flawlessly since purchase and is of good quality. Mounting to toilette is super easy, water connection is also easy. The wash modes are very nice, the water is never cold but sometimes cool, the heated blow dryer is the best and really works."
"I have purchased two VOVO Stylement TCB-090 SA. One of the two has been installed. The other is going in next week. I have never used a bidet so I have nothing to compare it to, but my review is for the incredible customer service I have received on top of an already amazing product.

If you have any issues or concerns, go to their website and look for their customer service number. You will not get any automation, someone will pick up your call. Ella has been incredible. I have called her during installation, when our contractor was having trouble finding the right parts at Home Depot. It turns out, the part is already provided in the box. Ella was able to point it out for us.

Two days to do the install (adding electrical, moving the plumbing, fix dry wall, paint etc), when we first tested, it either perfectly. The flush feature works, the lids were working. But after my contractor left, we finally gave the bidet wash a go.

That was when we noticed the water pressure was off. I have called customer service and left them an email with photos. Ella remembered who I was and even asked how the installation went. Amazing!

It was suspected that some water line may be kinked. She has sent me troubleshooting instructions. They are very easy to follow. It indeed have a kink in the internal water line.

Once fixed, two of the three sprays were working, but the last was still faulty. I have sent then a short video.

The following night, I have received a call from Kevin. He is VERY knowledgeable and patient. We have used WhatsApp to share screens and go over what may be the issue. Turns out, even with the kink resolved, the tube was sightly damaged. We just needed to snip off a piece of the bad tube and put it all back together.

It was very easy to do. Anyone could have done it.

It was such a pleasure working with both Ella and Kevin. No wonder people have been giving them a five star review. It was everyone's trust in the customer service that I decided to go with this company.

Love this purchase! Amazing product and amazing people behind the product. Thank you so much for your care and diligence.

Best."
"Easy install and works perfectly. Heated seat is nice as is the heated water. First time buying this brand of a bidet. Wish it had controls on a pad on the side of the seat though. The remote works fine, but we don't have a convenient place to mount it so we just put it on the sink counter next to the toilet. It operates very well and meets our needs."
"The toilet is phenomenal, and I love it! The warm seat feels excellent, especially during cold days. The automatic features work great. Opening and closing lids and flushing are a plus. The bidet functions also work well. I needed to replace my bidet, so I tried this one based on the reviews. I bought the toilet about a month ago, and it has been working without issues. The only thing that bothers me is the sensitivity of the sensor. I need to find a way to adjust the sensitivity of the toilet because the lid opens automatically when I am passing by the toilet or when someone enters the bathroom, even if they are not using the toilet.
The installation is tricky, so having someone with some plumbing knowledge install your new toilet is probably a good choice. The distance between the wall and the hole in the floor might not be the same, so it needs to be adjusted to avoid any water leakage every time you flush. Also, it would be best to have an outlet by the toilet. Luckily, I already had one next to the toilet. Other than that, everything is fantastic."
"When it works it’s AWESOME. Some details that I did not know and tried to find out before ordering and had no luck so here you go.... heated seat is fully adjustable you can turn it off as well if that is not for you (but it’s great). Auto flush feature is ONLY for when you are sitting. You can adjust the pressure, temp, and position of water to clean your behind so don’t worry there is a position for everyone. THE NOT SO GOOD..... (at least on mine) the auto open and close lid feature is very off (but you can turn off the auto close and open feature) Sometimes it opens when you are in a different room and sometimes it doesn’t close. I have even had to unplug and replug it back in because it stopped working. I wish you could change the sensitivity of the motion that allows it to auto close and open. The seat is not made of the best plastic and shows scratches pretty easily I would think the toilet would be made of a little better material. THE GOOD.... Seat height and size are great and is very comfortable. The tush cleaner is something you don’t know you need until you use it. It is WORTH every penny just for that. It has 2 flush settings and the full flush is strong have not had a clog yet. The deodorizer works surprisingly well. Install is very easy (make sure you install an outlet by the toilet). Overall I am very happy but wish a few things were different and I think the price is good for what you get especially when compared to some of the 5k-10k toilets."
"I ordered the Vovo TCB-090SA to replace our older Toto Smart Bidet. After conducting thorough research on various products available on Amazon, I ultimately decided to opt for Vovo. My decision was influenced by factors like pricing, features, and reliability, and the fact that they are manufactured in Korea further solidified my choice. Here are my candid insights:

1) Shipping was swift and the item arrived well-packaged with no damage or missing parts. I'd rate this aspect a perfect 10/10.

2) Installation proved to be relatively straightforward, with all necessary components, including a wax ring, included. I found helpful instructional videos on YouTube, which made the process even more accessible. I'd rate it a 9/10.

3) When it came to operation, I eagerly tested all the features, and most of them performed as advertised. However, the owner's manual was somewhat lacking in clarity, making troubleshooting a bit of a scavenger hunt. I encountered an issue with the auto open/close function, which didn't consistently work by waving your hand over what I assumed was the sensor. I'd rate this aspect a 7/10.

4) In terms of customer support, I initially reached out to Amazon support, who directed me to Vovo USA. They provided initial guidance via email to reset the unit, but this didn't resolve the issue. First-line support was managed by Ms. Natcha, who promptly supplied all the necessary documentation. After I informed them that the problem persisted, I was contacted by Mr. KEVIN, who reached out to me via WhatsApp. He asked me to demonstrate the issue and quickly identified that a sensor needed replacement. They promptly shipped a new sensor the same day, and I received it within a few days. I've now installed the new sensor, and it's functioning as expected. For their excellent customer support, I'd rate this aspect a perfect 10/10.

5) In conclusion, I intend to purchase several additional units from Vovo to replace some of our older toilets. For the price of one Toto Neorest, I can acquire two Vovo. While the Toto may have certain superior aspects, given the price we paid, Vovo has proven to be a company I will continue to patronize.

A big thank you to the customer support team at VOVO, particularly Kevin and Natcha!"
"I received the product two days after ordering.

I like the design because it is clean and pretty.
Installation was simple, so I completed it myself.

I think the most important thing when choosing a bidet is the strength of the water, and I really like it.

I compared several products and found a really good product.
I am very satisfied with this product at this price.
I'm thinking of gifting it to a friend as well."
"Our VOVO toilet started leaking after less than a year of use. After a number of tests and and attempted troubleshooting, VOVO shipped us a new unit. Just installed the new unit and its working great! Really appreciate them standing by their product and getting the replacement unit shipped out right away."
"This was an awesome gift for my sisters
Birthday present. She likes all the features. Very pleased I have 2 Bidet’s myself and just love them… would not be without."
"The product was great in the first couple of months, then there occurred an issue with the bidet which tripped the electrical breaker. Good thing is that when I reached out to customer service for solution, everyone provided prompt help. In particular, Ella was very patient to answer my questions about the warranties and replacement. A replacement was sent to me immediately with instructions. Greatly appreciate the excellent customer service, especially 5-star help from Ella! Thank you, VIVO and Ella for your support and care for your customers!"
"It's been 3 days since I installed it, and it's working well. I'm also satisfied with the design. I should have bought it sooner. I am very satisfied."
"I was having problems with the lid opening and closing and Vovo, specifically my contact Avery, was highly responsive and with several question and a solution that was above and beyond by replacing a part for me. I continue to be thrilled with my decision to purchase this!!"
"I shopped around for a bidet toilet and of course I looked at Toto among others. When comparing features with overall cost, the VOVO hands down was and is the best choice. Product quality, performance...I couldn't be happier. Also, their customer service is amazing. A person named Avery was extremely understanding and helpful. I am considering calling my electrician and having another one installed in one of my other bathrooms. We all love this product!"
"Have had this for nearly 3 years now and it has worked flawlessly. I haven't had a single issue with it. It still functions and looks like it did when brand new. I seriously thought it would probably only last a year or two before things started to break down, but it hasn't. I absolutely love it and will definitely buy another when it finally breaks down. If you've never tried a Bidet you don't know what you're missing. Well worth the money!"
This will be my second of this product. I love it. The seat warmer is a game changer. (Especially for women that have to sit every time.)
Great product. Make sure that u order the oval shape seat and not the round. Oval gives more room to sit
"This is my third bidet over the years, it replaced a Bio Bidet unit that had broken. I like that it is fairly quiet overall, and it fits the oblong toilet better than the Bio Bidet but it has a couple of quirks. First, the seat itself doesn't seem as comfortable as the Bio Bidet and secondly, the auto shutoff is much quicker than the old unit so I need to push the button a second time to get as clean. I do think the dryer works better than the previous one and given a choice again, I would buy this model based on fit and noise level. One other minor thing, the remote is a bit bigger and clunkier than the old one but does use a magnetic based and the buttons are truly buttons vs the capacitive ones on the old unit. Too new to know how these will hold up over time but so far so good."
"This toilet is the worst toilet I have ever purchased. 1. It has no suction when flushing, you have to keep hitting the full flush button just to flush toilet paper. 2. The lid opens and closes when your not even near it. 3. It never does a full flush unless you keep hitting the button for it when it is supposed to determine when to do a small or full flush. 4. It is very noisy when flushing. 5. I have to keep scrubbing the bowl because it looks dirty all the time. 6. It says it comes with everything you need to install, it does not, you have to purchase a special adapter that I have never seen on a toilet like this. I do not recommend this toilet at all. So sad since it has all the options on it I was looking for, just wish it worked like my other toilets.

Update: Vovo reached out to me and replaced my toilet, now works like it should. Very good customer service. Would recommend this toilet. Changing to 5 stars."
"Play Video
 I read a lot of the reviews on this VOVO TCB 090SA and I ended up purchasing the toilet because the majority of the reviews are good. However, there are multiple reviews that the toilet leaks where the seat connects to the toilet. I hired a plumber to help me install this toilet, and I paid for a second wax ring as well as the plumber. The toilet leaked every time we tested it at the supply where the seat connects to the base. I’ve submitted a video in this review to show exactly where it’s leaking from and I also attached an image from the manual pointing out where it leaks from. I believe this is the reason why people buy the more expensive toilet where the name replaces the V of VOVO with a T for TOTO.

Edit - 1/10/2023:
I’m increasing this review from 1 star to 3 stars because of how this company handled themselves.
Kevin from VOVO has been very kind in offering his service to replace the toilet. He also refunded me the plumbing and delivery fees which speaks volumes of this company. I still ended up purchasing the TOTO toilet as we just had a complete bathroom remodel and the VOVO toilet that leaked caused damage to our newly installed baseboards. Had this toilet been tested before it was shipped out they would have instantly caught the leak. Hopefully the company will do better quality control and correct the part that is known to leak."
"Worst toilet no suction when flushing, I have to keep hitting the full flush button just to flush toilet paper. It never does a full flush unless you keep hitting the button. I have to keep scrubbing the bowl because it looks dirty all the time. I do not recommend this toilet at all.

I was give the review 1 star since I have several issued after I post this VoVo sale and Tech support reach out to me,
Thank you for VOVO support team you rock star to help me resolve the issued ,just a simple fixed I can give this product 5 Star, and thank you for Tech support team"
"Toilet works perfectly, except for one thing. The seat will come down unexpectedly, and suddenly during male urination. Customer service has been very attentive. I have rebooted the toilet three times, following both written and telephone advice but problem persists intermittently."
"I replaced another bidet toilet I bought from amazon, and then spent over $1,000 on plumbers' bills thinking my pipes were bad since that toilet had such a weak, finicky flush. I bought this unit, and it flushes like a jet engine. If you have small pets or toddlers, keep them away when you flush, or they may get dragged down the drain. But seriously, it has a powerful flush and the bidet parts work fine."
"Bought in July 2022 also bought another one in October 2022. I love the comfort of it, sits high enough which is needed as we age ... I need 2 hips replacement, so I have a lot of pain sitting on standard size toilet, this one is the best! we feel very clean after the VOVO cleans our private parts, as clean as after taking a shower! it is the only way to go do our private business in the water closet, now my wife and I, are avoiding going to public and even friends toilets!!!
Be aware if you see some competitors offering similar toilets for less money ... as the Smart Toilets made in Korea, are better made and more efficient and more reliable as well!
I had a technical problem with one of them, due to my water in our area being hard water ... the power of spray got weaker and eventually may have corrupt some digital circuits making the bidet part not operating properly.
I called VOVO and the young lady named Ella, who took my call, spoke in a clear English and understood very well my issue and was quick to help to diagnose the trouble and they sent me a new Bidet top at no charge since it was under warranty and we installed it, and it work like new again!
We will clean our filter more often due to our hard water to avoid trouble in the future.
I highly recommend this company!"
First the product overall was as advertised I love its cleaning ability. My only criticism is that the air dry is just not strong enough to dry completely. I find that there is a lot of water residue left on the posterior.
We love this toilet. It is a game changer and everyone should get one. We recently had a problem with the top lid auto opening. Kevin and Ella worked together within 24 hours to respond to my email. After some limited troubleshooting over the phone they agreed to send me a whole brand new top unit even though we were well over our warranty period. Who does that? Kevin and Ella at Vovo did that. So appreciative that they are sending me a new unit tomorrow. If only all companies operated this way the world would be a better place. Thank you Kevin!!
"I started out installing this in the main bathroom of our house, but the stainless T kept cross threading on the American Standard Cadet 3's toilet inlet. After trying a few times, I thought the T supplied with the Vovo VB-6100SR had bad threads so I put the regular toilet seat back on. Before boxing up Vovo bidet for return, I thought I would give it another try on the garage bathroom's Kohler Cimarron toilet. The seat template supplied with the bidet fit the Kohler toilet better than the American Standard, and the T threads worked perfectly on the Cimarron's inlet without cross treading. The installation is pretty quick if you don't have to fiddle with fitting incompatibility. After checking the connections for leaks, I plugged the 4 foot long bidet seat power cord into a nearby GFCI protected receptacle. Next I installed the remote on the tile in a convenient location near the toilet. The remote holder has 3M double stick tape on the back so their was no need to drill holes to mount the unit. With the remote mounted, and the power on, the bidet was ready for use.

Using the seat is pretty easy to figure out with the remote control, and after a few uses I have to say I'm a bidet convert. To get the best results, I use 2 clean then 1 1/2 dry cycles. This pretty much eliminates the use of toilet paper which will be better for our septic system, and save money too. Since our water comes directly out of the river and is not treated with chlorine, the toilets need to be cleaned frequently. With the Bidet UV LED light on, the bowl stays clean without all the extra scrubbing. The heated seat is really nice
and I find myself going out to the garage to take care of business :) Even my wife is making her way out there because the experience is pretty awesome. Now I need to replace the bad inlet on the house toilet so we can get another Vovo VB-6100SR."
Happy with this one. Hope the plastic holds up. Wish you could make it spray longer. I would recomend.
"Update the replacement was sent.. they sent just the top area. No need for a plumber to fix easy take off and on. They gave you a box to send the top piece back that was not working. Customer service called back with checking and proof they found a system issue with the old unit. I appreciate the validation.

It keeps trips GFCI circuit breaker, brand new only used it about 5 times since purchased 8 months remodel vacation house. Happened when a guess was using it. Called the electrician tested everything in the bathroom. Pulled wires from ceiling thinking it was everything except the bidet. Finally plugged it in at another socket and it trigger the circuit breaker. Purchased 2 now wondering when will the other one give me the same problem. My electrician bill will be the same cost of another bidet.. not happy I was thinking it was the electrician original error.
I updated the review 3/23/23 because the customer service was helpful and since I purchased 2 and only one is not working no need to give it a 1 start.. The replacement video with just the top half being replaced is helpful. Waiting for the ups package to show up they provided a return slip."
"I really like the product. It works very well, the remote control is very handy, motion sprayer, heated seat is wonderful, and my husband had no issues installing it. I have had this product for 2 years without any issues.

Recently the toilet bowl light went out and I had great customer service with Ella.

Thank you."
Don't get me wrong I like this product. Just I feel like the price for it doesn't match.
"I have replaced 2 Toto Washlets (3 altogether) in the past 30 years but decided to give this a try based on the reviews.
Pros: Looks good and is sized slightly larger than my elongated bowl (vs Toto's being slight smaller) when measured in the inside but not obvious unless you look. In fact, it looks more ""customized"" than the TOtO . Easy to install , about 40% less than Toto.
Cons: The initial unit I received provided heat that was too uncomfortably hot for the seat even at the lowest setting. Its customer service contacted me after reading my initial review and advised me that it would send me a replacement which was received within 3 days. Replacing the seat took about 15 minutes and was an easy task even for me. The seat of the replacement is less hot but tolerable. I would prefer an even lower setting. Since the spray function is also stronger, I presume that the one I initially received was likely defective. Kudos to customer service.
Verdict: Each of my Toto washlet lasted for about 10 years but only time will tell on whether this is at least as durable. I like how easily this product can be installed. Regardless, once you have used a Bidet toilet, you will never go back. In fact, one thing I miss most when traveling (except in Japan) is the Bidet feature. It saves toilet paper need as well-something to remember when shortage occurs or when you get repeated bouts of diarrhea.
Rating: Vovo Toto
Cost less 40% higher
Easy install + 0
Response time - +
Maintenance less 0
Overall They function equally well but Vovo with less moving parts will likely be at least as
durable as Toto and far less expensive. My wife prefers the Toto, I have no preference."
I received rHe Toilet yesterday and I like it. But I have at least two things I’d like to mention the first is the remote control bracket is very flimsy it took me about two minutes to try to slide the remote control onto the bracket when I mounted on the wall. The second thing is the water massager the massage is your bottom. I’ve tried every single way but the problem is is the needle like way that the water shoots onto your bottom even when I reduce the pressure it’s still need a like and it does not have a nice broad spray and it actually hurts. Out of the three different massage functions the female or feminine one is the best for me and I’m a male. I just can’t understand why they would make a spray like this it almost pierces your flesh and if anybody has hemorrhoids this will be extremely painful I would imagine. Now unless I’m doing something wrong I will except anybody that has a different solution to this but I have tried reducing the pressure and changing all the different functions on the control and I still can’t get that good broad soft spray other than that I really like the toilet
"Let me start by saying I have been using the toilet for several months now and absolutely love it. UV light, deodorizer, bidet function, choice of flush modes and a heated seat are a total upgrade from my last toilet, so what is not to love. However, when we first installed the toilet the bidet function was not working properly, it seem to lack water pressure. I called customer service and within days I new bidet seat arrived. I was concerned that I would not know how to install it as I plumber installed the toilet during a bathroom remodel. I could not have been more wrong. It was literally done in 4 steps, and came with a link to a video on Youtube. I would not hesitate to buy another Vovo product on my next remodel."
"There is nothing I dislike about this seat.
First I got a seat with one missing part to attach to toilet. One quick call to the number provided and a real person answered she said No problem I will get you to Katja. Katja was extremely helpful and answered my second question and said oh no your seat is defected I sent a new one. Don't sent it back to Amazon. That was on Monday she sent already the return instructions and my new seat arrived on Thursday, it would have been on Wednesday if the weather permitted. Wow!!! That is good old costumer service.
I love also the Vovo is manufactured in South Korea.
Now the performance!! I only used the bidets in Europe most with cold water. Well, after pelvic reconstruction I think I should have warm water and all the conveniences of a good bidet.
So easy to operate and installation was a breeze. The cord is kinda short but the guest bedroom has an outlet on the other side of the toilet yes I put a 1 inch hole thru.... no problem. Two months later it's been operating as promised and going at night to sit on a comfy warm seat....now that is luxurious and returning to bed with a clean tush......priceless!!
My daughters are in the process of remodeling and want to install the bidets."
My first bidet and its pretty good. I didn't give it a 5 star because the cover and seat plastic does not seem like it's going to last long. I get the seat is a warmer but it still should be constructed with durable hard plastic. I love all the options it has to offer. The best part is the retractable nozzle. We all know things splatter so it helps keep things clean. I bought a filter for the toilet as well. We want clean water so they should offer it as a combo.
"I bought it six months ago and I am delighted, I only had one small failure and I contacted customer service, and a person named Ella helped me very quickly, answering my questions and the next day she replaced my vovo, sending me a new one. It works amazing just as advertised."
It is easy to install and does everything it says it will do
"Beautiful, modern design, qualities and performance speak for itself! Amazing customer service! After two years I had a minor issue with my bidet. Ella at Customer Service did troubleshooting over the phone, She is amazing and knowledgeable and stands by her product.
I am looking to buy BODY & FOOT DRYER ALL-IN-ONE Another amazing product by VOVO"
"This bidet top takes the lowest rating of all 8 bidets I've had experience with. So, I like the Wood bridge the best. I do NOT like this one, most notably, I could not get it to heat the water. Remote range is almost not there."
"Amended review: Vovo has been responsive to my complaints. After a couple of face-time tweaking sessions the toilet’s function is improved. It generally flushes as expected now. These are apparently not tweaks you can do without service assistance as they involve changing the the pre-set electronic time/flush parameters. But the fix was quick and easy as Kevin talked me through the changes. The toilet still has some quirks: the heated seat stops working from time to time for no apparent reason. You may think you don’t need a heated seat but you are WRONG!!! Also the bidet function warm water disappears from time to time. It seems to come back on its own. Not sure why. That’s always a shocker!
VOVO’s customer service has been excellent. Overall I am pleased, as the toilet now pretty much works as advertised. And I can assure you this is the most comfortable toilet to sit on I have ever used. My wife even loves it and she hates everything.

OLD REVIEW:
Do not buy. This is an addendum to review below. Vovo’s solution to my issue with this toilet was to unplug it for a few minutes. That did nothing. Their next idea is to send a valve with more powerful flow. I presume I have to pay a plumber a couple hundred bucks to install this as well. I’ve already paid $1500 for the toilet and hundreds to have it installed ( as part of a remodel). So paying again is a crappy solution for a crappy crapper. Pay for a brand name. Even though this was almost as expensive it has to be flushed two or three times, EVERY TIME, to rid it of waste.

After living with this installed for a couple of months I am happy with the comfort, style and amenities of this toilet. But it does not flush worth a darn. It takes at least two flush cycles every time. At least."
"I was so exciting to use this toilet, however, I now regret the purchase...for this price, I would assume that the toilet would be designed and operating better. Had to call the support line several/multiple times, since I have been having issues with the functions from the beginning...the nozzle malfunctioned multiple times and apparently when the nozzle does not come out, the entire main PCB needs to be replaced, so now I am waiting to receive a response from the customer support...I think the worst design of this toilet is the seat, I have attempted to capture what I am describing here...It appears that the seat has been constructed by placing 2 components together, which results in the lines that you see on the picture, and those will trap all the discussing stains...so you will need to go in there and scrub it to get all the nasty dirt that gets trapped in those lines...personally, I regret with not going with another smart toilet. Personal opinion is that this is not worth it...too many flaws and issues...disappointed with the purchase"
"I got this Vovo bidet system last year. Still works like it’s supposed to. A month ago however, the soft close system failed. So when I put the seat down it slams loud. Everything else works so I called up tech support. KEVIN is the man! He helped diagnosed this step by step via FaceTime at after hours, until he was able to assess the problem. He sent the part and we conducted a second FaceTime to walk me through. Now it works. Now the seat falls down slowly and quietly. Hopefully it stays like this longer but what a great support team! Thanks!"
"It was a nice feeling bidet and was easy to install without tools but when I turned it on all it would respond to was ‘Off’ & the toilet light! I even had my 30 yr old son try to make it work because at 61 I’m a little technical challenged 😁 But all we could do after unplugging it & trying to reboot it or get the toilet to recognize the remote all our efforts failed! We even changed out the plug we were using thinking maybe a bad wire somewhere but all it would do is flash on the back. I’m writing this review because I called Amazon (if the robot tires you say ‘Live Representative please’ & you’ll get a live person in a short wait. My Amazon rep, Chi, was awesome patiently listening to my complaints & telling me what Amazon would do to remedy the situation. She wrote to the seller which in a matter of hours reached out to me w/suggestions to correct the not responding remote w/me writing them back I had already tried all of those. They said they were sorry & swap it out or refund my money of which I chose the latter. Amazon was amazing at picking it up! I had a cpl options of which I chose to have UPS come to my residence & pick it up w/UPS bringing the prepaid label w/them. I just wanted people to know if you pick this product & something goes wrong within the 30 day return period you’ll have no hassles returning it & you don’t even have to leave the house! I got it delivered on a Saturday, tried the install Monday evening, by Tuesday daytime knowing it would have to be returned, Wens. talked to Amazon rep, Chi, Thursday morning UPS picked it up & by Friday morning I had my refund. Most painless return I have ever made! The bidet looked amazing tho & was so simple to install but alas it was not meant to be 😔 Hope this review helps you decide whether or not buy this bidet but know if you do Amazon has your back 100% for the 1st 30 days & so does the seller. Good luck bidet hunting! Lol if I ever see the word bidet I want to throw up! Too many choices! Oh & the seat would heat up & was amazingly warm & comfortable. Got to give a nod to that 😆"
"Update... 18 months later with only 8 months of use, i have to figure out how to repair the heating element for the sprayer. The seat is nice and toasty which I love. (Note: customer service said there's a reset button inside unit)

This is really a low use unit with me being the only user and out of town 9 of the approx 18 months since purchase.

Oh well. ### 10/10/22 ###
‐----------------------------------

Almost too long but it works. Could be my toilet design.. No leaks and simple install.
Flash sale marked down 70 from 299. You could buy em for 235 so I saved 20 bucks. Now, 18 months later, they're back to 299.

Watch your measurements. Bit long for me but is still works

Lots of features others don't have. Reading directions is recommended as I missed features not noticed until I had the problem.

I'd buy it again. Customer service is great and quick. Always a plus. Too many features to pass up compared to other units costing more.

Don't know how long it'll last but others I've used have quit working over time. I suppose everything breaks eventually.

Comparatively speaking I should get 8 or more years of use out of this one. I hope so. I couldn't go back to the primitive way I use to do things. Just a heated seat is a blessing.

It gets 4 stars because I have to open the unit for the reset button. It could be moved to be accessible from the outside.

Rtp"
I had an issue initially with a small leak. Kevin from VOVO was very helpful and professional helping me resolve the issue. I’ve been using this toilet for over a year now and have been very happy with it. I even purchased another smart VOVO toilet for another bathroom in my home.
"I cannot complain about the product itself except for a little bit of weak dry air than I expected.

My main complaints are about the installation manual.

After communicating with the customer support of the manufacturer, I knew that the type ""A"" accessory option was discontinued. There is no more type A and B. The enclosed installation manual must be updated accordingly.

Also, more detailed information is necessary when the enclosed shutoff valve must be installed. I had trouble finding a way to replace my original 1/2"" - 3/8"" shutoff valve with the enclosed 1/2"" - 1/2"" valve. The technical support of the manufacturer told me that I need a Sharkbite 1/2"" MNPT male adapter. But, I need to remove a ring for a nut around the pipe in my bathroom before putting the male adapter. I purchased a ""Faucet Handle Puller"" from Superior Tool from a local hardware store and removed the ring. Due to the small space between the pipe and the toilet, I had to use an elbow-type Sharkbite 1/2"" MNPT male adapter."
"This is the 2nd one I've purchased. (I also had the round toilet version, which also had problems)

When it works, it's fantastic and does what's supposed to do.
Has a heated seat, water reservoir, air blower, all which have 3 heat settings. It has a UV light for the toilet and multiple sprayer positions and power levels.

The issues I've had with this one and the round version:
The round version would randomly stop spraying, clean, then start spraying again. Sometimes after 1 second, sometimes after 5, sometimes not at all. I figured it was just unlucky and purchased this elongated one after remodeling my bathroom.

The issue for this one is different:
It will randomly reduce the spraying power from it's normal 90-100% to 20%, which means it is not doing anything besides wetting your bootay.
This happens 50% of the time I use it.

I thought it could be hard water deposits, as I do not have a water softener, so I CLR'd it and same thing happens.

I've also tried power cycling it, unplug for 10 seconds, 10 minutes, over night.. Still has the issue. At this point, it has to be an issue with the software, either that I've gotten unlucky twice now.

I can recommend getting a bidet, they are great. I just CAN'T recommend this brand."
"I moved from one home to another. I had a bidet in my previous home. It was a 2 piece toilet with a bidet seat. It worked perfectly for over 6 years. When i was looking for a replacement for my new house, i thought it would be great to buy a low profile single unit. The VOVO STYLEMENT TCB-090S Smart Bidet Toilet was the one I chose. It came to my home as expected and the packaging was in great shape as they used great packing materials. I needed an electrician to add a circuit and plug in the bathroom. Due to the building code we installed a GFCI circuit. The installation took about 1 1/2 hours to completely unpack and install the toilet. It worked perfectly right out of the box. I didn't read the manual and decided to call in to customer service to turn on the night light feature. It was well documented in the manual. Their customer service team was great. They helped me turn the feature on. It came right on. I thanked them for their time and effort. They told if I had any other questions feel free to give them a call. About 3 weeks later they called back to make sure I was completely satisfied with my new bidet. That was a great touch, i really appreciated the follow up to my previous call. I gave this product 5 stars since it was easy to order, well packaged, easy to install and use as advertised. I highly recommend this product and company"
"I have enjoyed this awesome bidet for over a year now. If there were more stars I would definitely give to them. From the warming seat to the deodorization and sanitizer, this is a true household favorite. Easy to keep clean and without the bulky tank, it can fit in smaller spaces without giving up the comfortable seat size(I’m a plus size female). My teenage daughter loves the warm water feature, especially when her monthly monster rolls around. Lol. We have saved so much on toilet paper it’s crazy. Don’t miss out. This is such a caring company, the tech support goes above and beyond. Kevin is very knowledgeable and patient. This is just an all around spectacular purchase."
"Update:
I got a replacement bidet and it works as advertised! We have been using it for almost two weeks before I updated my review.
Also, the customer service has been great!

Previous comment:
Really wanted to love it but for the price I expected everything to work as expected.
- Auto open and close... worked for a day. Not sure what happened. I tried resetting it multiple times.
- I had water in the resolver ones... Not sure how that happens. You have to remove the whole bidet. What?
- The sanitizing light... I am pretty sure is just a light
- I do love the tankless system. That is really great!"

 Just installed this toilet and took it on a maiden voyage. The installation was relatively simple except the existing water source line had to be swapped out because it was the wrong connection. Other than that minor hiccup and a quick trip to Home Depot, the toilet installed as easy as it looked on the video. There was little to no setup required other than setting the auto open and close or the LED light. Adjusting the nozzle was easy and adjusting the spray pressure made very little difference in my opinion.

The feature that I am most disappointed with is the air dryer. I wasn't hoping for the power of a Dyson Airblade dryer because that can literally shred your taint, but I was hoping for something stronger than if I fanned my crack with my hand to dry it. It is currently a useless feature on this toilet. I still had to use a good amount of toilet paper to dry everything and hope i didn't leave paper remnants like that Charmin commercial with the young bear that had toilet paper confetti'd all over his butt.

All in all, it is a 3.6 star product. If they're able to improve the air dryer to something in between a light fan and a leaf blower, it would be a 5 star product."
Absolutely loved my bidet. My stroke left me with some toileting issues and this unit kept me in my home: thank you Vovo. My issue is my remote no longer works and I’ve done all the things in the owners manual to get it to work again. 5 stars otherwise.
"I installed a 090S into a water closet plumbed for a regular toilet. I ran an electrical line down from the attic and created a plug in outlet for the new bidet. The water line connection kit provided does not work for most homes in America. The standard toilet water line into your toilet is a 3/8 inch line and after the shut off valve, that is already in place. this male end is too small to work with the large connection hose sent by VOVO USA. I went to 4 hardware stores trying to find a connection, without any luck. After speaking with Ella and Kevin at VOVO USA they sent me the right parts to correct the problem. Kevin face time with me to ensure it was connected correctly and was excellent in troubleshooting a few issues. He was great. MY ADVICE to any future buyers - buy direct from Ella at VOVO USA and ask for the small hose kit (assembly A) if your water line is a 3/8 inch line. It will save you a lot of frustration. Good luck."
"This review is about VOVO STYLEMENT VB-6100SR Electronic Bidet, round model. Bought after reading multiple reviews on this Korea's made Electronic bidet. For my husband, installation was easy, but he read plenty materials about installations of similar products and took in consideration all advices given. Basic tools needed to install this bidet. Easy to use remote control is a convenient necessity and works exactly as designed. Wonderful piece of equipment of good quality for unpretentious users. Our expectations were met - 100%."
All the features at a good price. Replaced a 6.5 yr old Brondell S300-EW that began leaking (apparently its end of life according to other posts) with this Vovo VB-6000SE. More features at the approximate same price when purchased. Vovo made in Korea vs. Brondell in China. Hopefully this has a longer life span. Easy to install and has worked flawlessly from start.
"After using this product, any other Toilet is just second best! 👌"
"I love this bidet system. It does what it is designed to do with luxurious ease. Installation was very simple too. One of my favorite feature is the remote. It comes with a mountable holster that can either be screwed in or secured by an adhesive magnetic strip.

Unfortunately I have very hard water which has caused sensor and leaking issues over time. I spoke with Vovo's support technician ""Kevin"" who offered to send me a replacement bidet and a complimentary filter to resolve the hard water issue. The product is great, but I'm giving a 5 star review mostly because of the customer service experience. Kevin was courteous, friendly, very knowledgeable, and eager to resolve the issue to my satisfaction. I'm very pleased with the product, but the customer service aspect speaks greater volumes!"
"The builder installed this toilet a few months ago, I found out that the feminine wash did not work. After trying to troubleshoot, I emailed customer service. The respond from them was quick and easy. The technician called me and tried to solve the issue. He told me that it has to be replaced and he did it right away. . I just received the upper part of the toilet and will find out if it will works. Other parts are functioning properly. I am impressed with the services VOVO USA provided me. Oh, the look of this toilet looks very nice and it makes a statement in the powder room."
"Replaced an old bidet seat from another brand with this one. I like this much better. It was easy to install and works great. It has all the standard functions and a remote control. Multiple settings for each feature. I was a little hesitant about unit without a water reservoir but it comes out warm. Dryer needs a couple cycles to dry but that’s the norm with bidet seats. I’ve had it for a couple months now and am quite happy with it. Bidet seats are the way to go—get clean and save toilet paper, not to mention a warm bum on cold nights. You’ll probably save enough money from not buying TP to pay for the bidet."
"Play Video
 I only have one problem… we I go to other bathrooms I forget to flush. It just cleans everything perfectly. At first I didn’t think it was getting everything clean. Now I know it does!! We did hire a plumber to install it. We had a little problem and customer service took very good care of everything."
"I am a contractor bathroom remodeler and have been using this product for years. Recently, I’ve dropped my remote and the company sent me a new remote free of charge, no questions asked. I’ve spoken to them since and beyond having an amazing product, their customer service is second to none! Natcha and Ella can help you with buying a product or any issues that may come up. I highly recommend Vovo products!!"
"I do love this thing, but I think in general just love bidets <3 it was easy enough for me to install by myself and I am NOT very handy. It does its job! One thing I didn't see in the listing is there is a weight sensor in the seat, so if you select a wash without sitting on it, it won't spray all over your bathroom, which is great! However, I noticed it whirs a lot. I first noticed it when I would stand up after peeing (am woman, I sit to pee), it's like it had prepared itself to deploy but didn't get a chance. It's weird, like you've never heard of sitting to pee before? Idk what preparation is involved inside there. I don't use the seat warmer or nightlight. I have also started to notice quieter whirring WHILE I'm still sitting. Regardless, I think it works well and has all the features I could ever want! If you're hesitating to try out a bidet, I definitely recommend giving it a go."
"I recently purchased and installed a TCB-090S Smart Bidet Toilet. Installation was fairly straightforward, but there was a leak from the Jet spray outlet (where the bidet meets the toilet). This is a press down connection, and it only leaked when the flush was active. I ended up calling Vovo tech support. I immediately got a real person, who then put me in touch with a technician. The technician used video conferencing on our phones and guided me through step by step troubleshooting to eliminate the problem. He was friendly, patient, and extremely knowledgeable. I can't really comment on the toilet itself yet, but Vovo's tech support was amazing. Thank you Kevin for the help!

"Overall an excellent product. It seems to tick off all the features one could want in a bidet, and executes them almost perfectly.

The heated seats are incredibly welcome during the winter.

I'm pleased with the retractable stainless steel nozzle, and I like how it cleans itself after every use. I spray it with 100% ISO alcohol for sanitization once a day.

The heated water works very well too. Super convenient to not have to cut a hole in my sink to hook up hot water. The overall assembly was incredibly easy.

Negatives:

Sometimes executing an order on the remote will result in the nozzle extending and then immediately retracting and cleaning itself. This isn't anything more than a minor inconvenience as it always works immediately after I press the button again.

There seems to be a very slight decline in the seat. Perhaps I didn't install it perfectly. I solved this issue by using foldable wooden footstools I bought here on Amazon.

This one isn't really a negative, but I'd like to mention that I would use the heated air dry feature if I could be confident there was a sanitization process for that vent.

VOVO this is directed at you: perhaps add a UV sanitization light for the hot air vent to ensure I'm not blowing bacteria infested air into the wrong place.

Overall I'm extremely satisfied for the price, 100% would recommend. It's awesome and my bathroom experience will never be the same."
"After living in Japan 20+ years ago, I finally have a bidet toilet that has the bells and whistles I wanted including the night light and auto seat and flush. The flush is awesome and a second flush will not be required again with the Vovo! Was a little concerned with the Squamish shape an find it to be very comfortable too. About to order a second one for the second bath."
"I had difficulties connecting the seat to the toilet, as the valve and connectors has little to no spacing and required a precise fit within a tight space environment. I recommend a rubber-connector that will conform to the water-intake from the toilet.

Otherwise, it's working fine."
"We had an issues with our VOVO... but the seller took care of it right away even though it took us a year to install the toilet due to a delay in a home renovation. Anyhow the unit works perfectly now. Kevin called us and walked us through the replacement of the part needed.
Awesome customer service."
"The conversion nut was missing. Without it I can’t connect the hose to the current shutoff valve. I cant find replacement at homedepot because of foreign threading. The guy at homedepot is well aware of the incompatible threading issues that most people are having when installing an imported bidet.

Update:
Vovo (Ella) responded to my inquiry and helped resolve the installation issues. The remote control has a missing light and she sent the replacement right away. Appreciate it."
"I put off buying one of these for years. I was not sure how well these would work. I am very pleased. Works better than I had imagined. Every home should have one. Even the dry mode works better than expected.

I will admit, I burst out laughing the first time I used it because I did not know exactly what to expect. The stream was a ""bullseye""."
"First, let me say that this is a spectacular company. Due to a recent move I lost parts. They helped me order replacement parts very easily over email. Then one of the replacement parts was lost in shipping and they very quickly sent me a replacement free of charge. Now I know most Americans don't use a bidet, but I got to say that's a huge mistake. Now that I've been using it for over a year, I can't imagine living without one. The feeling of being clean is impressive. A warm toilet seat in the middle of winter is spectacular. And a UV light to help keep the toilet clean is wonderful. Do yourself a favor and buy one."
"I bought the bidet and, unfortunately, had to return it because of our toilet's tank. VOVO contacted me and sent me a replacement of a slightly different design. Unfortunately the new bidet still didn't fit my small toilet seat because of the tank's shape. My parents have an older, small toliet, so I thought they could use it. Especially since my father has cancer that causes major skin problems. I figured being able to wash instead of wipe might be helpful. Fortunately I was able to easily install the bidet on their toilet and it fit surprisingly well! The blower is just ok, about the same as the bidet we own. It won't dry you completey. I don't know what you would expect from something so small. It's not a hand dryer like you'd find in a public restroom.
Overall, I was very pleased and my father gave it a thumbs up. Thank you VOVO! They went above and beyond!"
"Have only had this for a few days but everything is amazing. The seat stays warm, water is always warm and the fan is overly warm. Don't recommend the highest setting for the fan! Ouch.
Would highly recommend
The water settings are great, once you figure it out. Want one for every bathroom but husband says no. Lol"
"This toilet does feel like a cheap plastic, but for the price I guess I understand. My issue is that i got the right size for my toilet but this toilet seat never clicked in. So other toilet seat never sat right on the toilet. It exposes the toilet rim and the toilet cover won’t stay up. No matter how I tried to install this seat, it never did stay where it was supposed to.

Sometimes the water temp changes on its own as well, but every time I use the bidet, although the nozzle or water pressure are set to a certain setting, I still have to mess with the settings for it to change back to the setting.

The nozzle comes out pretty close to the rear end so I have felt the nozzle brush up against my rear end. A bit tmi but i wish it was a bit lower so it wouldn’t do that. I’ve had other bidets that don’t do this. My biggest issue is just the fact that it doesn’t fit my toilet. It sits weirdly. I did follow all instructions. My toilet never did the click that the instructions said it had to. I’m past my return window so I have been able to use this and get a good feel for it. I wouldn’t buy again. But it’ll do if you are on a budget and not super picky."
"Two-year update: Working very well. No issues at all so far.
Initial review: After reviewing many similar products, I got to a point where I really didn't know which one to buy. Quite honestly, I was tired of reading reviews and saw that this one said 'From South Korea', and I know those folks do quality stuff and S Koreans are big on sanitation and cleaning products. So, I took the risk (no reviews at all when I made the purchase :0). The toilet lid/bidets arrived promptly and well packed, no missing or extra parts. It looked very easy to install but I had some guys fixing some things in the house, so I just asked them to do it, otherwise they would have sat there for weeks waiting for the plumber in me to have the time or the drive to install them. Also, it needs al electric outlet, and there wasn't one close to the toilets. I would have just used an unappealing extension cords because the electrician in me doesn't like the risk of electrocution messing up with wires... so they guys installed the outlets as well. We have been using the toilet seats/bidets for two weeks now and they feel comfortable and sturdy, easy to operate, pretty comfy. I ordered two, and we had each one set a little different in different bathrooms."
We are very pleased with our VOVO smart bidet toilet. Kevin at VOVO was a fantastic resource and provided excellent customer support. We own a Toto toilet which we love. This VOVO is just as good for a 1/3 of the price.
"I called Vovo product support and was put in contact with Kevin. Kevin took me through a Facetime troubleshooting session with the greatest professionalism! He promptly decided to send me a replacement seat assembly with a return label for the nonfunctioning seat.
Many thanks to Kevin and his efficient handling of this issue!"
"You can call this a throne for the 5 minutes you spend doing your biological waste procedures.
This DEFINITIVELY increases your quality of life, and you feel much better than cleaning up with toilet paper (though you will use WAY LESS just for drying)

3 wash modes, dryer, heated seat, UV Disinfectant light. I wish the dryer were stronger, but hey! it is an excellent electronic bidet to start with!"
"Play Video
 Best toilet I have ever used. Comfortable, Ease of use and setup. So far so good."
"I have purchased Japanese style bidets in the past. I love them. The problem is they can be very expensive. I owned a Num2 ($6,500, yes insanity) and a good friend has a $4,500 Tot.

The Vovo is their equal for 1/4 the price. It ok under 20 minutes to remove the old toilet and install the Vovo. I suggest going to their website. The instruction video is about 30 seconds long and is complete! The Numi video takes about 10 minutes and it took almost 2 hours to install because it did not use the existing toilet floor bolts, new ones had to be installed and if they are off by a fraction of an inch… trouble. Oh and the remote is wireless, no drilling walls!

Get the VOVO!
And as for customer service? If I could give VOVO a 10 I would!

PS, I’m not taking any photos, you will thank me in the long run😁😁😁"
"I have 2 bidets that are on the more affordable range and this one is by far worse. The dryer is so weak it doesn’t always flip the little plastic piece up so it only works 30% of the time. The water pressure is low even on turbo. I always have to adjust the nozzle placement even though it says it’s all the way forward. I have had this Bidet since March and I’m already looking to replace it. My smart bidet on the other hand is older and works twice as well.

Edit: giving another star because of the the excellent customer service. After this review they reached out to me and got me a new unit. This one does work better, still not as good as my other bit it does work better.

The customer service was just amazing so giving 5 stars now"
"I installed the bidet in my new house but discover the builder used compression style Plex piping so I was not able to connect directly to the toilet valve. I sent an email to customer support and I received a call from Kevin in California not Korea. He was very helpful in suggesting an alternative connection which worked very well giving us a very complete flush in both modes. I’ve only had the toilet working for a day now so I can’t comment about it’s longevity but so far, I could the controls were intuitive and the automated features work really well. I would not hesitate to call Kevin again if I need help. The FaceTime with our phones was very effective."
"I bought this and a 4000 series and was happy with both, until the 4000 series started leaking. I called and they immediately sent a replacement which was easy to change out. When it started leaking again I called, and although confused about the issue, it was finally resolved when the technician called me back to ask whether I had well water or city water. I have well which sediment does collect in a number of filters (washing machine being a prime candidate). Simple solution a cheap, easy and replaceable water filter for both bidets! I’ve ordered filters, they are sending a new replacement immediately. All this to say that their customer service is so impressive! I would and will use them again for any of their products."
"I found the bidet to be quite good, except for problems with the sensor on the toilet seat. When we use a ""Squatty potty"", which raises the legs, the sensor loses contact and disables the bidet functions. On some occasions, even reactivating the sensor by placing the legs on the sensor doesn't enable the bidet. I had to literally step out of the restroom and come back in to have it work again.If UV lamp is enabled, it turns on as soon as the legs lose contact with the sensor even when I am seated on the toilet. Toddlers legs don't activate the sensor and UV lamp says on. I suspect that this is a safety hazard in a long run. Bidet cannot be used by toddlers because of the sensor. I bought this precisely because my toddler wanted a warm water bidet jet but it is unusable by her.

Have contacted their customer service if there. is there any way to disable the sensor/sensing features or any workarounds exist to the above problems"
"My husband had one issue during installation. The seat would not slide onto the base bracket, with it installed on the commode, like the instructions directed. So, instead he put the bolts, bolt brackets and base bracket together, slid it easily into position on the seat. Set the seat onto the commode and positioned it by eye sight correctly. He said this was far faster and easier than how the instructions have it. It works great."
"We discovered water dripping in our bidet, but the company promptly addressed the issue by replacing it. However, the problem was not with the bidet itself, but rather with the high water pressure from the city. Once we replace the old water valve we have to reduce the pressure, all the issues were resolved. We absolutely adore this product, it's truly excellent."
"Has all the features I was looking for in a bidet for half the cost. It's slim profile doesn't take up too much space on the seat compared to other detachable bidets on the market.

The reason, why I gave it 4 out of 5 is that the two option bolts depending on the toilet, mine were the plastic bolts and screws that don't tighten well which sometimes unscrew out of place over time. A quick tighten from the back every now and then will do the trick. Other than that, that's my only complaint. Hope Vovo have a better alternative in the future. Small imperfection that I can over look for a good quality bidet."
"We are loving this product. The installation directions were easy to follow. We did have a minor issue with the remote and reached out to customer service. We spoke with Meredith and were given suggestions on how to fix the issue. While the fix helped for a while, we were forced to reach out again to Meredith wherein she guided us to a way to fix the problem completely while keeping the door open for any further issues we might have in the future. Thanks to Meredith, we can enjoy our purchase with security if we ever have an issue (which we won’t) in the future. Thank you Meredith!"
"I don't do bathroom talk with anyone ,but after using this toilet ,I have been telling everyone about how amazing this vovo toilet is . everything in the reviews was great . and I went with it .and so happy ."
"Cons: 1. Dryer is a rather slow. As a result, drying off with toilet tissue is still required unless you run the dryer through multiple cycles 2. Everyone is accustomed to using the closed lid of a toilet as an occasional seat. You cannot do that with this unit. Pros: Does the job well once you get used to using it."
"The toilet started to leak water when flushing from the water reservoir after 2 months of use. This is a manufactured defect. Very poorly made for the $1600 piece. The installation itself was torture and now a leakage. Stay away from the m product.
Update:
Honestly, the costumer service was great and new piece was sent to me promptly to replace the broken one. Hopefully the new one will last for a longer time. I will change my review from 1 to 4 stars because of the costumer service."
"I had my first unit break within one year (heating stopped working), but I reached out to customer service and they were super super helpful and gave me a brand new unit.

Hoping this one lasts longer!"
"This VOVO electronic bidet toilet seat did not disappoint me. My friends have been recommending me to use bidet and this is the product that I chose after looking over reviews on different websites. The delivery was very accurate and prompt and I was very satisfied with the safe packaging. The product came in perfect shape and it was very easy to install, only took me less than 10 mins (I'm not a professional installer!). One of my favorite parts about this bidet is its design. I ordered Round shape and it is very sleek and comfortable when you actually sit down. Another favorite part is that it has 3 levels of water temperature, seating temperature and dry temperature so you can adjust the heating level to your style. I always put mine on the highest temperature. This bidet comes with cute and convenient sized remote control as well. It allows you to control in 5 levels of water pressure and nozzle position. It's been slightly more than 1 week ever since I started using it, and so far, I love it."
"I purchased two Vovo units and even though there was a minor glitch in some part of the auto lid close/open, when I called the toll free number on the installation kit, to my surprise a live person answered within seconds and pleasantly walked me through the trouble shooting without all the bs you usually get in such situations from big companies by sending you from one extension to another. This lady named Natcha was very informed, helpful and professional. She stayed on this until I got the help I needed. I will buy this again and I recommend it."
"This product works as described. Very comfortable. After a while, you really miss it when you have to go to a standard toilet.
The toilet started to leak after 6 months. We called the customer support of VOVO, who put us through to a service technician named Kevin. He called back by video call, and led us through the process of removing the cover, removing two hoses, pressing in the hose connectors, and putting everything back and testing. This solved the problem. Turned out they had an assembly flaw when we bought it in October 2021. I really like the friendly problem-solving attitude of Kevin. Seems to us that the company stands behind their products!"
Easy to install and all of the features are great.
A time or automatic on & off switch for the led light for night trips would be nice.
"The bidet seat is great, but at almost exactly a year, the water heating function stopped working. I called the customer service number and they walked me through a potential fix. When that didnt work they sent out a new bidet seat promptly. They were very helpful and stand by their product. I beleive we have the 6000 series."
"Play Video
 Upgraded to an electric bidet and since this one was one of the best prices I found I went for it. Pleasantly surprised by how easy it was to install. My only complaint is that the water pressure could be higher and could be a little faster, but other than that I love that I can increase and decrease the water pressure and seat temp. It has a power saving mode, but the seat always remains warm in this mode so not sure how much electricity it’s saving. You’re able to turn the whole thing off if you’re that concerned about cost savings and just use it when needed. I don’t use the air drying feature. Doesn’t seem to do the job all the way and the ‘massage’ function doesn’t seem to have any functionality. All in all I would but it again. As a sidenote, this need electricity, so you’ll have to either run extension cord into your bathroom or plug it into an outlet. I ran extension cord and then covered it up with conduit."
I got this because I am getting ready to have a colonoscopy. I had read that the pre-care for the colonoscopy can make things really sensitive with how often you have to go. Toilet paper supposedly makes this way worse. So we got this and I haven’t had the test yet but the toilet seat and functions are amazing. I don’t know if this will last us forever but the features you get for the price are amazing. I can’t believe it has instant hot water to clean your downstairs. I wish all my faucets had that!
"My experience with this product is not too dissimilar to others on here. I almost gave up on this product a few times and planned on returning it. Then, as if it knew it needed to work or disappear in whatever warehouse the Ark of the Covenant did in the first Indiana Jones movie, it just… started working. My review will highlight how it came to be, so you hopefully don’t throw it away immediately when it doesn’t work.

For starters, this thing isn’t that hard to install on the toilet. Before you install the seat and power it on, though, it’s a good idea to manually fill the reservoir. Flip over the seat and you’ll find a plastic screw (Phillips) just above and to the left of the seat housing (where the buddy seat clips into the mounting on your toilet). Unscrew it, fill up the reservoir (be careful not to spill - you don’t want to damage anything electronic), and screw it back in. If you’re feeling confident, you can do a 2-for-1 here by using included PVC tubing once connected to the water supply. Crack the angle valve to give yourself a slow, controlled supply through the PVC tubing to fill the PVC tubing AND the reservoir so no air gets trapped in the system. Connect the tubing to the seat, flip over and mount the seat to the toilet. Power up the bidet, and now for the coin toss…

You’ll either have it work immediately and be happy, or everything but the water dispensing will work. In my case, the water dispensing still did not work. My troubleshooting was cut short due to a change in work schedule, so I left it alone for 2 weeks. When I came back, it was fully functional. Possibly something inside the reservoir loosened up in my absence? Either way, time with a full reservoir may play a role here…

Now that it’s working, I will say that the auxiliary features (seat and water temperature adjustments, primarily) are really nice features. The water pressure seems a touch lower than I assumed it would be, but it gets the job done. The night light is a welcome addition, so I don’t have to blind myself in the early AM hours. Would be nice if the power cable were a few feet longer, but I have set it up so it isn’t an outstanding issue. This thing, when it actually works, performs as advertised. If you’re looking for a good bidet with some bells and whistles, and you’re willing to invest time and effort to make this thing work (I won’t hide that fact - it seems like some of us had to do some additional troubleshooting here…), then this thing is great, especially at this price point.

Good luck!"
"The washing function is great. It really does leave you very clean. However, the air dryer started out blowing warm air. I noticed that after a couple of weeks the air from the dryer seemed to be getting warmer and warmer until it became uncomfortably hot. Now the air is just room temperature, which feels kind of cold when you're already wet. I'm assuming a coil overheated and then broke. Thankfully, this does not affect the warming of the seat or the water.

If it were not for the broken dryer I would have given this 5 stars. Because of the broken dryer it's more like 3.5 stars. I can live without the dryer which takes a lot of time, anyway. However, I don't like the idea of having my purchase already not work as designed in two or three short months. It makes me wonder about the quality of the construction and how long it will take before the other coils go.

If I were to suggest one feature, it would be that with one button you can turn off all of the LEDs, even the ones for power save or standby mode. They're quite bright and they light up the master bathroom at night. We now have to close that door or cover the lights at night because they're visible in the bedroom when we're trying to sleep."
"got this bidet during winter time because it has a heated seat and at a more reasonable price point compared to other brands. Really easy to install and have been awesome to use. I like the water spray, drying, there's one for woman, and you can adjust the seat temp and water pressure too. It also has a cool UV light. The only thing is that it has a tape on the seat that after you peel it off, it's sticky and you have to really clean it off. Sometimes the water doesn't come on and you have to restart it. I contacted customer service about it and they sent me a new one. Incredible responsive time and really takes care of you. highly recommend"
"This was easy to install without a need for other parts, etc. and fits on the toilet well without slipping or sliding. Our toilet is close enough to an outlet so no extension was needed. There are a lot of features/and options. Sometimes the buttons seem a bit sensitive and need to be pushed twice - but it may be user error. :) The water heats to a good temperature and has good pressure. We are pretty happy with the purchase."
Very satisfied. Excellent product at a great price. Was very easy to install and everything works great. Was so impressed with the bidet that I bought a second one for the power room bathroom. Highly recommend.
"12/23/2023 Update: the water stopped warming and now I'm in a conundrum. The only reason I spent as much is to have warm water. I have not even had it a year, tho the warming did last past 6 months. I honestly don't know what to do. I have enjoyed using it when functioning properly and now I'm just gravely disappointed.

Original review:
Came with everything it was supposed to, and also what appears to be a roll of tape with a purpose I know not. As a non-plumber person, I found installation pretty easy. Anyway, I read all the reviews and sensed that some of the complaints may not be the fault of the item. The only one I'd like to dispel for you is the issue of the water not working after installation. This happened to me as well, but because everything had been done correctly (and honestly because this was my second bidet attempt this year), I wanted to see if there was something I was missing. I sat on it and read the manual thoroughly, as opposed to just skimming and mimicking the drawings. On one of the last pages it instructs that if the water isn't working, air may be in the tube. So I got a little pail, pulled the tube out of the reservoir for a few seconds (it says 30, but that sure seems long to have water gushing out of anything), and replaced it. Plugged it back in, turned it on and left the bathroom- instead of staring at the blinking light to see if it would stop. When I returned, the light was not blinking and ta-da! It worked exactly as it should.

I will say: it does seem like a a few things have adjusted since I first installed a couple weeks ago- the water pressure for the rear has eased a bit, and the water pressure for the lady parts intensified. It's set to high. To a degree it doesn't matter because the lady parts function only worked for that area the first couple times; it now only hits the rear, and the higher power is good for that. I don't know how I can be sitting so drastically different that the lady parts function is ineffective after seeming right initially, but I honestly didn't get a bidet for my front parts. The oscillating feature was also more obvious during the first couple uses, now not as distinct.

All in all I like it and have my fingers crossed that in 6mos the water will still get warm!"
"The instructions were terrible, it's only pictures. I could not understand how to use the rubber anchors until I watched an instructional guide. Other than that, it was decently ok for me to install it. It pulls a lot of electricity and my lights flicker.

The seat is angled down and you cant lean on the lid like you can a traditional toilet lid, which I never realized I did. I have to adjust the way I sit on the toilet set (posture, etc) but it's not bad, just something to get used to. The whole seat just slides off so that makes for easy cleaning.

The bidet part is... interesting. The nozzle hits the right parts. Make sure the levels are on the lowest levels at first because the high level really hurts me! lol The heater is just for show because it never gets things completely dry and water still drips when standing up (which is ok, i just use a towel). I've only used it for 2 days, I need to keep using it for a few more days but I think it's a nice addition to the home."
Overall this seat is pretty good. Hubby installed said it wasn't hard. But 2 things I do not like about it are the seat is not very comfortable and the water comes out pretty hard .yikes..I would not really get this one again for that reason. But the heated seat is awesome ..
I was concerned the seat was wet out of the box. The instructions are not the best. Heated water is nice. The spray of water is not as strong as one would expect it to be. The spray nozzle does not move back and forth as indicated by instructions. It will serve my purpose after my dominant hand surgery.
"The only thing I dislike, is that the dryer is not very power, so I’m not necessarily dry. I’ve visited Beijing and South Korea and the bidet were amazing, that’s why I bought one. So the seat is definitely worth it."
"Both my partner and I love this bidet, the upgrade to a heated seat and warm water living in a region that has cold winters is amazing, no more sitting in a cold seat in the morning, or ever!

10/10 would recommend. It hits both of us in the right spots for cleaning, and they're in different areas if you know what I mean 😜"
"I love this bidet and I have been converted to a bidet user for life! My only concern after using the porridge for one year is that the heating function for the water stopped working all of a sudden. None of the other settings have a problem and it's nice to sit on a warm seat. But I miss my warm water clean...

Is there any way to fix this?"
"Day one: Installed it. Instructions fairly clear. Noticed a little leak - it was from me shifting the existing lines. Fixed and ready to go within 30 minutes.

Day Two: Actually used it. Wow. Total game changer and already thinking of upgrading.

So far, a few reasons I'm giving this 4 stars instead of 5:

1. The, umm, nozzle? It doesn't seem to be adjustable... you sorta gotta do a little wiggle wiggle of your posterior to get it all nice and clean. I may move this to second bathroom and get a other one with controls on the remote.

2. While the drying feature is nice... warm air... it's aimed at the bowl (or straight forward at best) rather than aimed at the spot needing drying. Still feels nice though. Wasn't dry at the end (pun intended).

3. Not a biggie but... does it really need to announce to the neighbors that I'm sitting on my throne?

4. If you use a squatty potty (another game changer), and you're skinny like me, you may end up lifting your leg slightly off of the sensor that tells the bidet there is a person sitting. Took me a good ten seconds to figure out why the dryer wasn't turning on.

Day Three: Wife gets home from work trip. Will see what she thinks!

So. If you're wanting to try a bidet out, trust what everyone is saying - it is a game changer. No need to try it out first. This is a really good one but do yourself a favor and fork over a few extra bucks for a model that let's you control the nozzle with the remote.

I'll add more if anything changes..."
"Seriously, yall gotta upgrade from the stone ages. This is the best thing my bootyhole has ever experienced, I was both amazed and perplexed at what I was feeling both internally and externally. I not only cleansed my hole, but I also cleansed my soul. I am eternally grateful. 10/10."
So far so good But you need a side view mirror to see the control when your ass hangs over the tiny seat. Designed for Asian children.
""
Works as stated on all settings. Definitely worth it a bit difficult to mount properly but i did get it juat had to hear a click but that was difficult to achieve . But did get it eventually
Why did I go so long without getting one of these product. Very satisfied
My air dryer won’t work is there a trick to it. Won’t work on auto or by pressing the dryer button either
This was very easy install. Working well so far
Love it
"Easy to install, good price for value, durability to be seen. Instructions unintelligible translation from Mandarin."
"Little uncomfortable but really nice for the price. I’m not sure if I did anything wrong putting it together but, it seems to be situated my at an angle. Other than that there’s a heated seat that makes up for most of my concerns. I think if I purchase a few seat adjustments underneath the seat it may did the trick"
I had to return it since you have to have plug in your toilet to be able to use it. We did so it didn’t work for us.
After using there is no better feeling than the cleanliness you feel.
It is taking a lot of space 😊
Very happy with my purchase. This works excellent.
This has all the features plus some. Heated seat and water. Very customizable. We had to install a power outlet near the toilet to plug it in. We actually bought a second one as a gift.
We got it for our aging mother to make her more comfortable. It works well and she likes it very much.
"The product itself is quite good. It operates as advertised and does a good job of cleaning and drying.
The only issue was, on installation on my toilet the shut off valve was cramped against the back of the commode base. I was able to install it and get the water on; but turning the water back will be a different story.
A friend of mine installed the same unit on a toilet in a manufactured home. The fittings were completely different and he had to change the attachment fittings to make it operational.

Just be aware that all toilets are not created equal.
I would have given a higher overall rating if the shut off valve would be more usable."
Light And functions All work well directions could be better mostly The part about sliding the seat onto the bracket to ensure it's tight enough also directions for removeing seat hold down bracket
"I love this bidet toilet seat. While I was installing I noticed they cheaper out on a couple things. The mounting bracket is plastic so it can slip around, the inlet tube is plastic and not a threaded metal line. I’ve only used it for a few days and it hasn’t caused any issues so far and I’m okay with it at this price.

For the bidet portion to work, I recommend removing the drain portion on the bottom and filling it with water with a funnel before you run it. Also push the connector for the water inlet at the toilet seat down and pull out the tube with your water on to get rid of any air and then reattach. Make sure the tube is fully seated at both ends for no leaks. Give it a couple flushes. Then leave it on for a day or two and try the wash button. Mine only started working after a couple days, and reviews on some of their other bidets state this.

The heated seat is amazing, as well as the heated wash. The light is cool I guess too. I hope it lasts a long time!"
Works well. However because of how the seat was attached the seat tends to slip.
"What a game changer. After a hemroid surgery, I needed needed to make some changes in the water closet. Got this setup and it is a game changer. I don't know what a cold seat feels like. The ergonomics of the seat. The soft close of the lid. And the feeling of truly being clean.

Pros. Comfortable. Easy to use. No batteries. Gets the job done. Warm water. Great pressure.

Cons. After using a few others, the only thing I would change is to add a bigger nozzle to get more flow than pressure. But the others I tried that had more flow, had colder water. So I guess this is a perfect trade off for now."
It works great but you need an electrical plug near by. The seat moves back and you have to pull it forward. Air dry is weak. I’m fat so I can’t see the control panel on side
"Seems a bit weird to share this info, but it is a bidet review. This unit does not have a specific feminine cleanse cycle, which every woman needs if they still have their period. The accuracy of the rear wash is Zeroed , right on target for the booty and the stream is intense so be prepared. There’s no handy valve or control to lessen the pressure for the bidet without turning down the entire toilet. The seat warmer is heaven, the blow dry is perfectly aligned as well. I and my husband are very pleased with this product."
Happy wife...haply life!
Never thought I would use a bidet in our home. This right here is awesome. The seat warms your tushie! I personally do not like sitting on s cold seat in the fmdead of winter. I also like that the nozzle is self cleaning.
"Mine didn't work as many others are saying. The instructions leave this part out. Remove the white plastic screw on the bottom. You may need a coin to do it. A regular screwdriver is far too small. Fill this reservoir with water and replace the screw, making sure it doesn't leak.
Mine still didn't work and I started a return. While it was unplugged for a full day or two, I figured I'd give it one more chance before sending off for a replacement. It works! If you so like I did and plugged it in before priming, just leave it unplugged for a couple days and it'll reset.
I love this bidet! The heated seat and warm water are essential in my opinion. The light is really nice at night, too! For the price, I'll be getting another for upstairs bathroom. Also, THIS FOT MY ONE PIECE TOILET! The price is great, too. The next cheapest bidet with all of these features was like $300 so for the price, I highly recommend!"
"This was the first bidet I purchased. The initial unit I received would not produce hot water and after some troubleshooting with Amazon, I was sent a replacement. That unit worked for almost a year before the hot water function died suddenly. Overall it was good for what it was I just wish it was built better."
OMG! My husband love this so much. It works great and easy to install. We have had for about 2 months now. No complaints.
I was pleasantly surprised with the quantity of this bidet. I have a Brondell bidet and the quality of this bidet blows away the Brondell and at half the cost. There is endless hot water and the dryer is the strongest I have every used.
the unit came in well packed box in a box this is a good thing the install is easy and i was too lazy to use the provided teflon tape once you get past the lockout feature in the seat everything else works as advertised. endless warm water and the heated seat is great.
"Someone posted a “trick” to installing the black stoppers so they would be tight. There’s no trick needed. The black stoppers don’t need to fit through the toilet seat holes. It looks like this person put the part in upside-down (literally). Intuitively, I put the threaded side pointing up toward the ceiling. Instead, put it facing the other way just under the toilet seat mounting holes. Next, put the washer and screw through the top side and bracket. Push the screw down through the bracket on the top side and continue downward through the toilet mounting holes and into the rubber piece. Hold onto the rubber piece at the bottom and turn the screw downward. The threaded part in the rubber piece will catch and as you screw downward it will tighten. The rubber is pliable and serves as a nut that will tighten the bracket firmly."
The size of the seat is far smaller than regular elongated seats ! Not comfortable at all
"Update again: got our replacement and the water heater stopped working this time after a week. Not happy with this brand at all... ☹️ but they did replace the 1st 1 for free...
Update: The company contacted us and the bidet was under warranty and they sent us a new bidet because ours stopped working right. The hot water heater had gone out. Now we have a new 1 (replacement) and we are hopeful that this 1 lasts.

This is a good bidet, but we have only had it and hooked up since the end of February and the hot water heater that is built in has already stopped working. We have water coming into out house that is below 40 degrees Fahrenheit. We cannot use the bidet now cause the water is too cold to have sprayed on our private parts. And we are trying to get ahold of the company to see about how to fix it, but all the responses I get is its non-refundable. I don't want to send it back, I just want it to start working again. 😵‍💫🤬😡"
"The bidet was easy to install and it has all of the features of the more expensive bidets but for less than $200 dollars. It has light, heated seat multiple water and seat heat selections and a dryer. So far I have had no issues and if it keeps going it will be an excellent find! I had another name brand before this and the seat cracked up. I will keep the review updated if anything goes wrong but until then this is an excellent find."
This the Cadillac of bidets. Adjustability and performance are fabulous.
"Bought this for my husband for Christmas, installed it and the light stayed red, followed all the instructions but it wouldn't pressurize or push out any water, looked online and found some information about trouble shooting, primed it with water, still light stayed red, contacted amazon, they sent a replacement and then we returned the original one, has worked really good since then, no issues, we really like it, has a good amount of pressure and the seat is comfortable, I especially appreciate the heated seat in the winter"
"It beeps everytime you sit down or stand up, announcing to the whole house you're taking a poop. The rinse functions work well but the dryer is not strong enough and will leave you wet even after two cycles."
"It took me a while to warm up to the seat warming feature (yes, pun intended lol). At first it freaked me out and just felt like someone else has just been taking a long time on the toilet and warmed it up for me. So yea, it felt a bit creepy. However, as the weather has gotten colder I have grown to appreciate this feature. Be careful with the heating settings for the seat and the water because it gets super super hot. I keep it at medium. My only complaints are: it takes a long time for the water to start spraying. When you are ready to get clean those five seconds of waiting feel like forever. Also, when you turn off the water the last few seconds of spray are freaking cold. Like yikes, ok, I'm awake now. So just brace yourself for it. I'm used to it now because I know it's going to happen. Also, as a left handed person it's annoying that all buttons are on the right but I get it, I'm a leftie and the world is not made for me. Overall though I give this five stars and highly recommend it. I'm spoiled by it now and hate going to the bathroom anywhere but at home."
"This just arrived today and other than it being a bit tricky to install, it’s not bad for the price. Thank goodness for the video on here bc the written instructions are terrible. The tube is way too long but I’m nervous to cut it and mess up the fit. And the instructions say nothing about trimming it that I saw. it’s also super annoying to get it positioned just right. Tighten latch, slide seat on, slide it off, loosen latch, tweak position, tighten latch, slide seat back on, repeat. At last success."
"This is amazing. I have had the bidet seat for a few months now, and I am still feeling happy every day about this purchase!

The hardest part of the installation was running the electrical. There aren't too many bathrooms that have an outlet near the toilet. I installed two of these, and I did each one a little bit differently, but for both, I added an outlet near the toilet in an out-of-the-way place. The next toughest thing about installing the bidet seat was that one of myshutoff valves didn't shut off on one of the toilets, so I had to but a new valve. The seat installed super quickly and easily.

For me, I don't want to burn a lot of electricity. There are two options here, as I see it. First, there is a built-in energy saver mode. That's what my wife uses. For me, I leave it off, and only turn it on when I sit down. By the time I need it, the water is warm enough for me.

The interesting thing is that I just returned from a trip to Europe. Most every place I stayed there had the separate bidet fixture, which I used, but felt was vastly inferior to the built-in bidet in the toilet seat.

Bottom line is that this is an excellent purchase that future you will thank you every day for making."
"Nice bidet, but water temp is extremely hard to regulate. Lukewarm to cool is about all it will do. Pressure is good, all other features are nice. Not so bad in the hot Texas summer, but will be uncomfortable this winter."
"Overall pretty happy, altho my only complaint is the water pressure is too much. I have the supply valve turned down to barely feed and give the bowl a flush while using it. With the flush happening it's comfortable and effective, but with out it's just too 'hard' of a spray."
"Would have given it 5 stars but was disappointed that the wand reach is not adjustable. But scoot a little and it hits were it needs to. Install was simple, I did prime the seat by filling the seat via the drain plug."
Othering than coloring.....like everything else about it.
"There were two difficult parts to this install. 1) installing a new receptacle close to the toilet (many will not have this obstacle and it can hardly be blamed on the bidet, but the builder of my home). 2) getting the line splitter valve lined up in a direction that wasn't facing directly into my wall....and honestly, this was primarily because I was cheap and didn't go buy different fittings. If I had, that valve could have been up on the toilet tank and not been an issue at all. I just knew I could use all my exiting hoses if I did it the hard way. The water tubing that goes between the splitter and the seat is plenty long enough and easily cut down to size with a pocket knife or even scissors. A 90° plug would have been handy, but a bought an adapter for less than $5 to get the power cable under control.

I bought a cold water unit for about $100 less than this one and it felt so cheap. I felt like I was going to break the seat, so I returned it. Not only does this feel much more substantial, but the heated seat, warm water, and light are SO much better than the cold water bidet. Well worth the extra money.

My only complaint about the remote control is that as a big guy, it's hard to see, but you can feel the buttons easily, so once you get the pattern down this isn't an issue."
"This thing is absolutely amazing. I wanted a bidet that was a little fancier than a basic one you hook up to the cold water. Not only will this heat up the water for you, it has a heated seat, a light inside and the thing blow dries your butt ! I’ve put several friends and family members on to this thing and they’ve been all super happy with their purchase. If you’re on the fence about buying, just do it."
"It's awesome, I installed in about 10 mins after removing the older bidet. it was very simple to set up once installed. I didn't even need the instructions, I just instinctively kept clicking the spray function until it primed and it actually sprayed. And OH BOY does it work wonders, that massage function is WILD it almost tickles. The heated water and seat is a warm welcome (see what I did there?). Also the air dryer actually works a lot better than I originally expected it to. Also if you didn't know its skin sensitive with a capacitive sensor under the seat so it will beep once it senses skin and actually allows you to uses the functions, other wise they're auto-locked out. This means when you're using the air dryer, you just stand up no need to hit the stop button."
"The build quality is not premium for sure for the money. I’d say it’s fare.
It did take me some time to figure out the wash feature though. Manual says it’ll take 30 seconds to self test with the light flashing, but it just kept flashing forever. I pulled out the washing water supply tube from the bidet (be prepared wash ejecting out) to ensure no air in the loop, and then quickly plugged it back in. Wait another a few seconds, I heard the bidet was being supplied with water. Then for another one minute, the self test light stopped flashing and finally worked."
Its wonderful to use on cold winter evening when you have heavy feeling on the ol gut cause you can sit down on a warm seat and not spook the ol sphincter like a cold seat would do
"This may sound weird but I’m in love with my toilet seat. It stays warm for me during the day and welcomes my bottom home with a cozy embrace. I’ll sometimes wait to go potty until I get home just so I can enjoy the cleansing spray of my bidet. It’s not the best on the market but it’s a great value. I started with the cheaper bidets that just spray cold water. After upgrading to this deluxe model and having a warm seat, warm water and warm air to dry me off, I thought I had died and gone to Japan! 😂 My only criticism is the pressure of the spray in a little weak so you have to sit a little longer to get clean. But hey, I’m not complaining!"
"easy to install, convenient to use"
This is more like a mini elongated seat. The controls are easy to operate. I really like the warm seat.
 I really like how easy it was to install and I like the buttons right there on the side. I love the fact that the light stays on all the time and at the toilet seat is really warm. All my friends are jealous when they come over🤣🤣🤣 I’m like who wants to ride this thing first?
The water temp and heated seat are great but. No matter what pressure setting you set it on it still doesn’t fully clean as expected. You still have to wipe after.
"This is my second bidet, and buddy let me tell you this is an UPGRADE!

My prior bidet was great but functional (~$100, totally non-electric) and was used far less in winter, when the water directly from the pipes caused a freezing sensation in my nethers. So when I moved apartments for a new job further north with colder temperatures, I wanted to try the next tier.

If you have never had the experience of sitting on a warm toilet seat to do your business, with your favorite song on your speakers (not included or built-in—surprisingly), dancing around while your toilet literally takes you from “poo” to “ew” to “woo!” through a fail proof auto cleaning sequence including to-your-liking heated water and a bum dryer, the next time you get a promotion or bonus at work I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT.

Nothing says “I’ve made it” like knowing you will never have to wipe or dry your own bum again in your own home.

I am 0% handy or good at manual tasks and successfully installed this bad boy by myself in <10mins.

Esp if you love simple joys in life, this is best daily mood boost you can get for $250. Highly, highly recommend.

*one month in, and this is still hands-down the best $250 I’ve ever spent*"
"I've been reading about how happy people are with automated butt washing. I took the bait. I decided to go ahead and buy this one despite having read that the hardware did not fit US threading. As far as I can tell, the problem is that most people don't know that you have to use the teflon tape on threaded plumbing joints. My first attempt succeeded. I installed it in short order. The instructions were a little vague, but since it works with no leaks, my guesses were apparently correct. You have to shove the rubber bulge through the mounting holes on the toilet bowl. That part is not obvious in the instructions. You can probably find a video if you're not sure how to install... The instructions read like they came straight out of google translate, but that's what I expected. The claims that the hardware is not US standard is simply wrong as far as I can tell. Just don't forget to put at least 5 wraps of teflon tape on each threaded connection unless your fitting instructions specify otherwise."
"I had to return the first one since water didn't come out of the bidet (big problem). I did read the reviews and while some folks had issues overall most were very satisfied, so I determined I just got a lemon, so I returned it and reordered another one. I installed the new one and it worked! This bidet is amazing and is everything I hoped it would be. Making the water connection can be a bit finnicky even if you do a lot of minor plumbing, seems the connections had to be inordinately tight. Installation and alignment of the bidet is easy. Recommend using a length of excess water supply tubing with a funnel to fill the water reservoir then filling the water supply tube with water before connecting it to the bidet to eliminate air in the water supply and avoid the ""air in water line blinking light fault."""
This is the 2nd bidet that I’ve ordered and I love it. You’ll need an outlet to enjoy the many features.
"The seat feels small and I'm not a big person at all. The buttons beep super loud. The lid feels like it'll break or hyperextend if I lean back on it. The water spray tickles my sphincter even on lowest setting. Pretty funny. The instructions for mounting the seat were a bit unclear, you'll need to be mechanically inclined somewhat to get through install. You need to prime the seat by filling it with water. Typical cheap China product. 1st week using it so TBD if I'd ever buy another."
"Toilet seat's warm seat feature is very warm I had to use the lowest setting !
The installation went with out an issues.
Night light is handy"
"Edit: 09/08/22
So there is one big problem with likely a rare occurrence. If you lose power while this is spraying, it will not shut off! Ended up making quite a mess since it was a breaker that tripped. Have to take a star off for the lack of foresight. A capacitor that could close the valve in the event of power loss should have been a feature.

Original Review:
This thing is pretty awesome. I had one LED light that didn't work. Otherwise, everything worked as expected. Pressure could be better. Still, very happy with the unit.

Amazon asked me to rate softness... It's a plastic seat? So, no, not exactly soft?"
"Just got this and haven't had a chance to play with it, but I had a lot of trouble with installation until I figured out a trick and wanted to share that with others. The rubber base pieces that are supposed to go through the hole in your toilet, I couldn't get them in. So I took a bolt and screwed it up from the bottom and from there it was easy to pull the piece down. ✌️"
"This is the bidet toilet seat. It was fairly easy to install, take old seat off and put the new one on, checking the diagram to make sure the connections were right. I have a fairly new toilet, so the valves worked and shut off easily. Plug it in using an outdoor extension cord. I like the violet night light, tried out the warm seating which will come handy in the winter. The water for ""cleansing"" is like the carnival game where you squirt water in the clown's mouth. Bullseye every time. The bidet function needs to be adjusted as it hits the perineal area but doesn't wash far enough forward. And there were no instructions on how to adjust that. The air dry function seems to blow room temperature air. There was only the one temperature control, and the water temp was the more important one."
"Dryer died out in the 2nd week of use. When pushing the dryer button, the system shuts down."
So the seat has a good amount of options and is comfortable…….BUT trying to get this thing working was the bane of my existence for a couple days!!!! The fan is just kinda meh. It doesn’t fully dry you off unless you want to sit there for an hour. The sprays work great and the heat is ok just be careful on high heat this thing will turn your cheerio into a toasted oat! If it was not so hard to get going I would have given 4 stars.
"I have been considering a bidet toilet seat for a very long time. It makes cleaning up a breeze. I just recently had shoulder surgery. Making certain parts. Hard to clean. This bidet toilet seat makes it much easier.

It was very easy to install. Works very effectively. Well worth the investment. I think I’m gonna get one for every toilet in the house.

It does require electricity. So you have to have an outlet nearby. Consider this before you purchase. I highly recommend using a GFCI outlet."
"The fastening fixtures are too soft, so the seat slips on top of the toilet. It is supposed to be tightly situated on top of the toilet. Also, the nozzle doesn't swing back and forth. Otherwise, it is good."
"This bidet is nice for the money. However, if there is a power surge it turns itself on with the seat temperature set on high! This is a waste of energy at the very least and a safety concern as well. I never use the sear heater."
"Have used this almost 6 months now and love it. Emailed seller today to find out how to turn the beep off (when sitting on or getting off the seat it beeps). Turn the power off, hold the stop button for 5 seconds, then turn power back on. Bingo! Also, thanks to reviewer Shari M. for this helpful tip: Hint, to install the rubber inserts, hand screw the screws a few turns to the bottom side of the rubber inserts. Put the screw end through the toilet mounting hole. Reach under with pliers and pull the rubber insert down until flat top is level with the top of the mounting hole. Take screws out from bottom to use as directed to mount the Smart Seat bracket. Great purchase!"
"Bidet did a great job of cleaning, but it died completely 1 month after warranty expired."
"I purchased this in July so it lasted 4 months. The electric circuit has gone haywire... all LED's are lit up and the Fan won't turn off. I am processing a warranty on it now. I would rather have my money back as I also own the ZMA201 model.... the first one had to be sent back within a week, the replacement lasted just a couple of months so I am my 3rd ZMA201 since August. We have hard water here so I put a bidet water filter on both and I highly suggest that you do that if you have city water so that they do not clog with calcium. The filters are here on amazon... made need to buy adapters like I had to depending on the brand."
"started a return because it would not fill with water. Finally took it apart and found that I had not pushed the waterline that goes into the seat hard enough to endure it clicked. Once I did this, the tank filled with water and it works great."
"I can’t believe I didn’t get one of these years ago, it works better than I imagined. I never thought I’d buy one but now I’d hate to do without it. Super Fast shipping, good instructions, quality unit and priced right. No issues, zero complaints. I already purchased a second unit for our other bathroom and highly recommend this brand and model for the new and experienced user alike."
"I’ve wanted to try a bidet toilet seat to see if one would compare well with a freestanding bidet toilet. But I kept putting off purchasing one. I researched this particular seat because of its features and it’s reasonable price. I am very pleased with this bidet seat. However, using it has a bit of a learning curve if you’ve never used a bidet (except in an occasional hotel room).
PROS:
• Adjustable heat settings
• Heated seat
• Self-cleaning spray wand
• Automatically retracting spray wand
• Water heats very quickly
• Three spray choices
• The installation instructions are good.
CONS:
• The 3-way connector (source/toilet/bidet seat) does not fit standard USA pipe size so you have to buy a different connector from the one supplied.
• It takes a little effort to line the seat up to the toilet rim which is necessary to function properly.
• The included operating instructions are poorly translated and hard to follow."
"Once you have one of these you won't be able to live wishout it. Works great and was easy to install if you follow the instrustions. the only thing I dont like is the fact that when the water frist come's on it's ice cold but warms up fast, and then right before it shuts off it gives you another ice cold squirt. I thing this is something the manufacturer could fix and it is annoying."
"My husband bought one elsewhere to install at an ems station he works some shifts because it was one of the cheapest he could find. It worked so well that we ordered 2 more through Amazona and they were still some of the lowest prices with the plan on putting one in the guest bathroom and the other at our office. After installing the one in the guest room I realized it was nicer than the $400 one in our master bath so I had the second one installed in out home and used the existing one at our office instead. I would buy these again in a heartbeat, they work flawlessly."
"This is wonderful except for one thing - Water stream is not as strong as other bidets.
The water is heated all of the time - the only way to accomplish this is to slow down the stream.
This unit is rated at 1500 watts so be aware!
Extension cords must rated for an oven
No NOT use a tripple tap - you can burn your house down. Seriously, the card will get hot at the plug end. The outlet will turn black as will the cord."
All things are working very well wish the pressure was higher but all in all very good performance
"I bought this because of decent reviews and cost was great. The product is ok, but one major issue is the water temp, both starts and ends cold. It’s warm during and that part is fine. I cannot get over the two shots of cold water that I need to brace for each time it’s used. I can understand the cold start to some degree, but not cold before stopping. To this point, I cannot find if there is a setting in literature or via online searches that can be changed. Right now, I would suggest a Smart Bidet, the other brand in my house that doesn’t break the bank.
Note to sellers. If you can tell me how to fix this, I will change the review accordingly."
"I purchased this bidet for my father who recently suffered from a stroke and is unable to clean himself. This bidet is amazing! It has warm water so even in the cold months you don’t have to get blasted with freezing cold water, and the dryer function is awesome for someone who has limited mobility and can’t dry themselves. The only thing about the product is that you need to have an outlet next to the toilet (or I imagine you could use an extension cord?) so we had to have one installed, but even with that hoop to jump through it’s still worth it. Now my step mother has one less thing to worry about and my father is living more comfortably."
"It’s easy to install, but not working properly! No watering, no dry air ! I asked to replace a new one to see if I was unlucky!

Got the replacement and it’s working, the problem is the water quality when they tested in China, it was blocked by the dirt of the water, once it go through, it works! Thanks for the customer service, price and quality are good!"
"I never realized how much i needed heat in a toilet seat. Until I bought this, and then used another bathroom! Hell no!! Im to spoiled now, and thats just one feature. This is incredible"
"This one seemed nice when wen1st got it except there was moisture in the bag and on the unit when we got it but we thought maybe they tested it out before sending it...., easy to install, used every feature to try it out right away it all seemed to work fine...then a little later I went back into the bathroom to see water all over the floor and saw the water dripping from the actual unit (not any of the connections) so not sure if i just got a defective one or what but it was easy to send back. I dont think they are all bad but this one was defective or maybe used and sent back without the 1st buyers reporting the problem. The one time I did get to use it when 1st installed the settings were perfect I mean it had a bullseye target on the spot it was supposed to hit lol THAT PART couldn't have been more perfect 😅"
"Installed easy after my toilet top bidet of 7 years stopped working. This one take a little bit longer to ""kick in"" once a button is pushed but 1) The water tempt is consistent & warm. No longer sitting there clenching my cheeks wondering if I'm gonna take a cold shot to the bits-n-nibbles instead of glorious warmth. 2) I had to purchase additional hardware to make my older bidet work... Loads of fun driving back and fort to Home Depot, no doubt, but was cool to have all the parts needed in the one box! 3) Not sure why ya need it but the disco lighting is cool - so thanks for THAT!"
This is my second bidet and i want to move it into my other restroom so i can utilize it more. Easy to use. Comparable to ones i used in south korea. The air dry feature is pretty awesome. My bhole has never been so clean.
"First, this is a good bidet (was). It has many features .... maybe too many, bc most probably won't use them all.

It was fairly easy to install. I say fairly bc the instructions are not super clear which side goes up and down when installing rubber grommets. I got it wrong the first time, but it was easy to correct. Clearer instructions would have helped.

I cannot recommend though after it failed after 3 months. The water still flows, heated seat is fine, but no more warm water.

Last, the settings on it to adjust pressure and direction are not that different. It appears to not change much.

We will try another next time. I'd suggest looking at better models or get the warranty?

UPDATE- Even though the return window expired from Amazon, the company sent me a brand new bidet. Upgrade to 5 stars just based on outstanding customer service."
"Ok first the bad. The T-Fitting gave me trouble. Plastic is the issue here. The supplied flat washer for the t- valve does not allow for complete sealing as compression is needed for the t-valve to seat properly. The wall of toilet valve is too thin to make proper contact. I had to purchase a conical type washer in order to make a proper seal. This of course seals from inside the valve tube rather from the outside.This, of course was very frustrating as to discover by trial and error. The conical washer is of the same type The water supply uses to connect to the tank, so the manufacturer should have supplied this type of washer. I think too a t fitting adapter that goes between the shut off valve and hose would have been a better choice.

The good it functions as described in the literature provided. However, as this is my first one, I would like to purchase a upgraded version that has programmable functions that are memorized features such as adjusting the time and sex of the person those would be nice features that are probably available on higher priced models, but for now, this model seems to be as advertised and functions as it should.
I got this model on prime day and saved considerable amount of money so I’m happy. The t-valve was the only issue I had. I do like the warm seat and water functions and night light is kinda cool. It does a good job washing your tushy hole. Although it’s rather long on auto mode. I’m hoping it holds up, time will tell. UPDATE: The second one I purchased stopped heating water, had no such problems with the older one. I sent the bad one back and ordered another replacement. I really like these."
I bought this for my grandmother and she now calls off her “great day.” There are so many convenient functions on this thing. Also the installation was incredibly easy. This is a great buy for the price point.
"So sad
I purchased the seat due to not needing a hot water line to install. Installation was a breeze and the seat was working great until last week. I have only had the unit for less than 2 months when various buttons/sensors stopped recognizing contact and was not beeping. Unplugged and plugged it in and that seemed to reset to allow for proper functioning for a few days.
Today when I try to lower the seat temp by pressing the correct button, the unit turns itself off. Bidet feature does not work. Not sure what is going on and it is past the window to return.
Was really looking forward to this seat, and was hoping it wouldn’t have any issues.
If it fixes itself, I will write a follow up review indicating so. Hence the current low rating."
"I am rating the customer service of this seller. Top notch as they are truly trying to do good and have buyers. It isn't their fault that the product is not as good as the Toto toilet. This seller is reliable, keep their word, and the seller tries to do everything possible to keep the buyer happy. The spout is not as accurately placed as a Toto washlet and it is better for smaller people. By smaller I mean the seat is small and be careful with the setting of the water, it can be too hard. Not a bad washlet, but it could be improved. If you have a Toto washlet you can see and experience the differences immediately. The light is very nice and convenient at night time. Not sure what the deodorize button is because there is no deodorant in it.

The customer service is absolutely amazing! You get refunded if your washlet doesn't work as it's supposed to."
"Yes it is cheap for the features, but it will not last. Mine made it 6 months before the water heating have out. Otherwise it was very nice.
Update,
I reached out to the seller and they sent a replacement fairly quickly. Hopefully they have found and fix some of the issues."
"This bidet toilet seat is great. It was super easy to install and as long as you use the thread tape to keep leaks from happening ( I had no leaks) it was a dream to install. Took maybe 1/2 hour and I was slow about it. Highly recommended , has most of features other higher priced units has such as unlimited warm water, heated seat, air dryer, you can adjust the temperature of the water and seat. You can move the sprayer in different positions, and it has a water pressure adjustment, nozzle position and more, it has a auto mode that does 4 steps right in a row then done, such as cleaning, massage, dry, and stop. It’s a really good buy for the money and is loaded with features. My wife loves it. I think it’s pretty cool as well . It even has a children button so it adjusts to the smaller body. Really nice. 5 stars in my book ."
"It's a very price effective toilet seat bidet. It works well and has a lot of options. Mine came with a leaky tee. I was about to replace it for $18. I also bought a 1/4 line elbow because the line to the seat sucks out at a weird angle otherwise. The installation instructions were a little wonky, but they work."
"It's very worth this price because it works as well as the promise. But it can be improved.
1) The tie into the toilet is not solid, it is easy to shift/move. The reason is that the design of the skew and clips is not well. So I wonder whether it's intentional to shift/move.
2) the touch area (the ring) is too narrow and makes it uncomfortable after a long sit. It could be 1 inch wider.
3) Lack of the specification to state the power consumption."
Easy to install 6 months ago still working fine. Not to diminish the product but it's hilarious to have these buttons with these pictorial glyphs explaining the mode buttons. We're going to have to add these to the dictionary
"The seat warmer makes the throne an actual throne. Minutes will turn to hours as you scroll your phone writing reviews with a toasty butt that brings a tear to the ancestors. The bidet part itself is fine. I keep the seat on high heat, and the water on the lowest heat. The highest setting will cook your intestines like Chinese street food vendor at the Spring festival.

When you hook this up by the way. Do NOT turn the water on slowly. The hook up will self seal once it hits pressure. Slowly turning it on will cover you, the bathroom, the wife, the dog, the kid, and the neighbors car with water as you experience a full body bidet experience."
"Let me start by saying this replaced a non-electrical bidet I had that just ran off water,pressure like a faucet. You controlled the flow of water.
PROS-love the heated seat
Love the warm water
Very easy to install no leaking. Hooked up about the same as the inexpensive one I had. I did hire an electrician to install a GFI.

CONS
There is a 8-9 second delay on the water engaging.
You can increase the velocity somewhat but not like the old one. I was disappointed in that.
Blower, not really. I was expecting a blower, this just circulates warm air in the area, not really blowing like I expected. You’d have to sit there a while to really dry you off."
"This Bidet is very comfort to sit on and has many features that a more expensive Bidet would have. What I wish that worked a bit better was Fan to dry. It does change temperature which is nice but not that powerful. It does have many functions but I wish the washing pipe that comes out would come out just a little further for the Femine wash. All in All I am pleased for the money and bought 2, one for our seasonal home and one for our primary home. My husband likes it too."
After I realized the fitting was to be connected to the toilet tank it was easy to install.
Every thing is just great.
"Hot water failed after a couple weeks, but seller promptly sent replacement. Controll handle could be out a little further as you cover it up when you sit. Other than that not a bad purchase."
We got this to replace another bidet we had for about 4 to 5 years. This worked well for about 4 months and then the water heater quit working. Contacted the seller and they sent a replacement. Good customer service.
Had a few issues at but seller made it right. A++
"I was pleased with the quality of this unit. The seat warmer is a major plus, but I keep it medium or low, as it can get warm. The water spray is not overpowering but cleans exceptionally well. I appreciate the drying but use it less than the washing. I am a cancer survivor and had a large portion of my lower digestive system removed in surgery. Needless to say, I sit on the throne a bit more than the average person and find that the water cleaning from the smart toilet seat is much better than wiping, as I tend to have irritation over time from the frequent visits. This is not the case anymore. I am a big fan of a good wash and highly recommend this unit."
"Notice it’s a bit short for my elongated toilet. There is a stop underneath the seat (see 3rd photo) where I aligned it to. The unit came with no instructions at all. All functions appear to work as they should and I am pleased with the results. I can’t see any benefit from the deodorant button. It stays on for a bit and doesn’t seem to make any difference, it was supposed to automatically turn on but it doesn’t. I can’t seem to get in touch with anyone to get info on it. Lastly, I may need an electrician to run a new line because when it is in use my bathroom led dimmer lights blink."
"I just installed this unit and so far I like it. The panel has a DEODORANTS switch, but the instruction guide does not say what it is. A Google search found the Ningbo ZMJH 201 manual, which has a table listing the Function Introduction, it says the unit has an ANION device, which is turned on after using for ??? (illegible text). The user guide does point to an ANION device next to the nozzle, so it seems to be a passive (non-ventilated) deodorizing gizmo. I'll find out in the coming days as to whether the Deodorizer works! But in the meantime, I'm impressed with this unit. (The ANION may be a negative ion generator type device, the mfg does not list it in the guide or webpage, probably they want to avoid having this bidet classified as an air purifier, running into CA's rules against such devices. Obviously, this is a bidet, not an air purifier. For the last days of using it, I've not detected any unpleasant smell, either from me or the bidet!)
Note that this bidet does not have an adjustment for the water pressure, which is v low on my priority list. The DEODORANTS feature outweighs the lack of water pressure adjustment, by a long shot!"
I had a bare bones one befor. no heat no dry no warm water. This has all that. Just dont understand why we havent embraced these here in this country. works great and i am never going back wading up paper and well you know. Wish i would have got one with a remote control but no biggy.
"Easy to install, stylish, fits great, only issue so far the Beeping sound can't be turned off ."
"This bidet seat does everything that most of the expensive the bidet seats do. The flow is great. The heat is great. The controls are very good and it even has a light that most units do not include. The only criticism I might have if you are a wider person, the controls are difficult to access. In other words, the controls need to be set out a little farther from the seat itself. Other than that the seat performs as well as higher priced units and we are happy with It."
I recommend one of these in every home
"I added 2 stars as the replacement works.
If I felt the quality control was a little better this would get 4 stars. It does what it is supposed to do pretty well. Definitely a big upgrade over the non-electric type...but I still recommend a cheap one over nothing.
Tested it once. It was great. Second time, it stopped working. Now the buttons beep, but don't do anything. Seat heated up water I unplugged and plugged it back in. That's it. Bummer."
"The seat cracked after 5 months of use.

Update: They refunded my order."
"I know this is more of a toilet issue than the product itself, but just be warned that if you are getting the “round,” your overall toilet seat size will be pretty tiny compared to what you way have had.
Hot seat function is great, easy install"
"I love this bidet, works awesome except for the fan but I don't want to wait that long to dry anyways. I don't want to poop anywhere other than my house"
Will try to go to Home Depot to find the part.
"You really have to use your imagination to get it installed, but once you do, it's absolutely fabulous!! It's warm in the winter, the bidet works great and the night light adds some class to the seat. I recommend it without reservation!"
"First off, I don't love the side the hose is attached, and the power cord is opposite where I need it to be, but I can live with that. Wish the power cord was even just 1 foot longer so I didn't need to use an extension. It works well. It's not perfect... sometimes, it doesn't quite get everything if you know what I mean, but temp is perfect, pressure is good and comfortable and fan is just okay.... it doesn't thoroughly dry, really. I give it 4.5 stars and so rounded to 5 because my life has been changed by this thing... so much so that I miss it when we are not home. LOL"
"I had a issue with this product, wrote a review, they reached out to me and made it right. That's standing by your product. Amazing customer service"
"Good alternative to the more expensive bidets on the market. Nicely designed and fitted well for my round toilet. Very easy to install although the instructions are for a couple of models. So, you have to figure out with instructions to use. Also, the controls seem to not apply to this particular model. However, it is very easy to work the controls. So far, all the features work great (after 3 weeks of use). I love that I can set the positions, seat temperature (for those cold winters!), water temperature, and air pressure and temperatures. The glow night light is particularly useful too!"
"This is what happens when an elongated toilet seat is designed by someone who strongly believes elongated toilets should not exist. The result is that even though you've got a nice generously sized toilet, the seat pushes you forward to the front edge so you're cramped on a tiny little space wondering why you spent so much money on a toilet seat designed by someone who obviously hates you.

On the plus side, it's easy to install. But since your quality of life is better if you fail to install it, maybe that's not a good thing."
"I bought this for my mother. She loves it. The toilet seat can stay warm 24/7 or you can turn it on at night. It has warm water which can be pressurized to your liking. It washes front & rear and has a dryer. It also has a night light you can turn on. It was a great buy. I want to add that it is a little shorter than the elongated toilet bowl. It fits, but would look nicer if it was longer. It's in her master bathroom, in a separate toilet room, so only she uses it."
"A bit of a challenge to install, and had to turn it off overnight and try again to activate. But once working it is fabulous! I got it when I had a hip replacement and it was great for that. Recommended it to a friend with ALS and another friend with rheumatoid arthritis, and they both love it too"
"The water stream is rather direct, rather than a wider stream. Therefore, too much pressure can be an issue. Controls showed adjustment combined with temperature. However, NO way found to switch between them. I added a small water valve near the seat’s input connection."
Brought this as a cheaper alternative. Has great set of features. The mail reason I got this was I don't have a hot water line in my bathroom area and really wanted a auto water heater bidet. This one seemed to tick all the check boxes. Sadly less than 30 days the water heater has stopped working. Looking to return the product.
"Love this. I’m 71 and it feels so good
I installed myself with no problems I like the controls on the side instead of a remote
Would highly recommended"
The water intake valve with bidet water feed is leaking.
FYI.
I had a Toto c100. It finally started to wear out. The control panel stopped working one button at a time. I decided to replace it with this much cheaper version of a bidet seat. It was easy to install and has all the features the other one did plus a light. I am pleased with it.
"It seems to be cheaply made for the price, not what I was expecting. It does the job but should have gone with the one I had before."
"The press-in water tube has slow leak from its connection under commonly used water pressure, had to reduce water pressure and water tank refill speed very slow so that it won’t leak. Maybe I got bad luck, Led lights not showing heat level, can’t set heat level for seat for water for dryer. No oscillation. Buttons are so hard to press or response. Sometimes it does wrong spay type not as controlled."
The product worked great for about 3 weeks until half the control panel suddenly stopped working. Believe me when I say there are some settings you don't want to be stuck at forever! Amazon couldn't replace it so we had to get a refund.
Bought it and used for a week. Suddenly the water heating is not working.
If you are really not sure about getting a bidet this is a great one at a good price. I will probably upgrade and get a more expensive version later but this was a great decision. Far surpassed my expectations.
"This bidet has some really awesome features for the price. Installing it was easy and took about 30 minutes. Everything works super well so far. Very happy with the purchase. I was initially a bit worried to buy this model. All the other reviews are positive, but everyone who left a review got one of these for free as disclosed on each review. However I can confirm that the bidet is high quality and has great features. I'd highly recommend it!"
Not bad but lost a lot of room on a elongated toilet all together...and if your chunky this thing won't wash your monkey 🐒...made for smaller body types...
Very easy to install
Realmente bueno
I like it. Fast to install. Cokes with everything you would need. All the controls work. All the functions work. Very happy with this product. And it’s less than the high dollar ones that do the exact same thing. Worth it
"what a luxury! do wish we had chosen the one with the controls on the wall. keep having to stand up to work the buttons. Overall, I like it."
"After one month of use the toilet seat leaks it flooded my bathroom overnight. It is not the waterline that is leaking it is the actual toilet seat reservoir. You can see where the water is coming out of the holes in the toilet seat. Not only did it only last one month but there is no way that I can find anywhere to contact the company. I guess it’s pretty easy for them to put down a one-year warranty when you can’t contact them to hold them to it.

This is also a problem with Amazon they should not be selling such high priced items without having the company contact available. The phone number Amazon gave me for the company is a wine company that imports wine from France. I would suggest you go with a company that actually has an office in the United States. And you should make sure that Amazon has company contacts before you buy something. I’ve learned from this experience not to buy anything very expensive on Amazon."
It worked okay for 3 days and then water heater stopped working and the adjustment is off and doesnt change much. dryer is weak.
I love this product it’s easy to clean. It works efficiently. I love all the different options to position the water as well as the temperature
works exactly as expected. easy installation
Heated seats always get positive compliments from guests! Installation was simple and fairly easy.
Cleans my booty better than I had ever imagined one of these could/would! I'm hooked.
"Easy to install, does what it says it does."
I liked that it is exactly what I ordered and was easy to install!
"Easy to install and use, cleans very well"
Works great its a good value
Warm water stopped after six months. Try to email company for warranty sent three emails have not received one reply in two months would not buy stay away.
""
It has been only 5 months since I have purchased and the water temperature feature has stopped working. Not happy with product.
"The unit itself is the proper shape and size for our toilet. But, Unfortunately; the parts they sent, are not fitting for usa toilets. The attachments necessary in order to fit it to the water hookup are not manufactured in usa. We went to everywhere from home Depot to specialty plumbing manufacturers, and could not find any part that would be a fitting adapter to the parts that were sent with this bidet. This was a very expensive disappointment."
I thought I found a good bidet with all the features that didn’t cost an arm and a leg. Unfortunately the water heating (the main reason for buying this) stopped working in less that 2 months.
After installation product only worked a few times. Had to return since the bidet functions stopped working. i.e. water spray.
Sent this back. Hard to use the connected remote while sitting on the toliet. Returned for one with a wireless remote.
"Installation was not smooth. Despite of tightening every way, I have been dealing with this persistent leak from the 3-way valve. Now I have to probably pay at least $100 for a plumber to inspect and repair it.

Seriously, I purchased this for my guest and I really needed to work. Instead, my guest and I had to deal with this. Absolutely disappointing"
I purchased this product and it worked great!! 5 weeks later the water stopped getting warm. The seat and the dryer also stopped getting warm.
product leaked from tank
Horrible product
"I got this Bidet to replace a single function one. I will tell you, this has every option you could think of. The warm water function is amazing! no need to run a second line from under the sink. This heats the water. The heated seat is an option I don't particularly care for. It feels like sitting on a seat someone else was just on. But it's still an option. The dry function is light and warm and works perfectly. I'm not sure on the deodorize function as to how well it works, but it's there too. Adjustable positions on the sprayer is great and the temp adjustment gives 3 temp settings. Only drawbacks I found, are the seat hole is smaller than a normal seat, but I'm sure this is to minimize splashing. It was tough to get started since it has a ""low pressure"" sensor which stops it from working, so setup was a lot of bleeding the line, and restarting (unplugging) the bidet. The seat also feels weird for a bit because it slopes forward. Awesome bidet though. It has all the options for a more expensive one!"
"My husband is 6'8"". My kids are 4 and 6 years old. I am the only medium sized person in my family - and I am the only person that can easily use this toilet.

The reason is that my husband needs the entire length of the elongated toilet to comfortably wipe, etc. And the bidet takes up 4"" of space.

And it doesn't work great for my kids, because there is a sensor to keep the water from working when no one is on the toilet (thankfully) and my kid's size means that the toilet sensor is not activated.

Now, for me it is great - all good!

So please only buy this if medium sized people are using this toilet seat!"
"BOTTOM LINE:
1. I recommend this ZMJH A201 elongated bidet seat.
2. The current price of ~$260 is reasonable considering all this bidet offers.
3. Without getting detailed, I still have need for some manual cleaning supplies besides just water and the air the fan provides. Far less than without this bidet though. Perhaps it really is one-stop-service from some, but not for me.

LIKES:
- Washes well. That's the number one job of a bidet.
- Adjustable water temperature.
- Fan? Yep, I kid you not. And the temperature is adjustable. I find it too hot on the highest setting.
- The seat has a rim and sits into the bowl. What does this mean? NO SPLASH ZONE when flushing. Yes, and please, then thank-you.
- Night light. I only wish it were a warmer color (perhaps 2700K). I don't like blue light at night which tends to wake me up more than I care too.
- So many adjustments. Even my picky wife will use this one because she has all the warm and adjustments she needs.
- Warms up quick. It uses up to 1500watts, so no delays.
- Grounded plug. I should add, that a GFCI outlet is essential to safely use this.

DISLIKES:
- I'm a fairly large individual at about 230 pounds. The seat opening is a bit too small for me because they store a lot of bidet stuff behind the seat. Let's just say I don't like my pieces parts touching the front of the toilet seat or bowl, so I have to sit further back than I normally do with a normal seat. Because it slides upwards, I'm going against gravity, so have to anchor my self with my feet. Not as comfortable as I would like.
- I have no idea what the ""Deodorant"" setting does."
"I have come to love this toilet. If you haven't experienced heated seats on you throne then let me tell ya, its an absolute delight. The led light is also a nice addition you won't want to do away with after having. Installation was easy enough you just unscrew the inlet hose going to your toilet and connect the included splitter. You will also need to plug this seat into the power outlet. So keep that in mind. I had to use an extension cable as my bathroom doesn't have a power outlet near the toilet but that was painless enough. Now I haven't used the bidet myself, but I hear good things. My GF says it takes some getting used to but now she loves it, says it makes her feel more European, whatever that means. lol The included air freshener and self cleaning mode are all nice additional features as well. Overall, this is a great product and gives your ""office chair"" a great modern, almost Tokyo, Japan feel that we were skeptical about, but have now come to know and love and I think you will too."
"A couple things to be aware of: It will not fit all toilet types. It requires an electrical outlet near the toilet. Since toilet seat bidets are not common in the US, there is an added expense for a safety AC outlet near the rear of the toilet, unless you have an electric background and can do it yourself. Once it's installed, when you go the bathroom, it is life changing. The seat is heated, so no more cold winter rear ends. You actually feel clean after using the toilet. My only comment for improvement is that the controls are difficult for me to see. I wish that it had a handheld wireless controller (deducted one star for this). Very happy with my order!"
"There are still a few features of this bidet attachment that I haven't figured out (for instance, I have no idea what the deodorizer is, whether it's something that needs to be filled, etc), but it is a nice upgraded bidet attachment compared to a non-electric version. The seat can be warmed, as can the water. The installation was not too difficult, but I will say the instructions were minimal, and I had to figure some things out on my own (for instance, the picture instructions make it looks like the rubber part goes above the seat-attachment holes, but they really go below). While I really enjoy some of the features that require electricity, it's kind of annoying to have a cord come from the toilet; the only outlet in most American bathrooms are above the sinks, and this necessitates having an extension cord to get it there, and it takes up a valuable spot in the outlet. This seat is in a secondary bathroom; my main bathroom has a separate water closet and there is no outlet near enough to use it there, though it would be nice to have one. Recommended but be aware that it's a little clunky if you don't have an outlet close to the toilet."
"If you've ever been in Japan you'll never want to be without one of these again. This is a decent off-brand seat that costs 1/5 of the Japanese brands, so it does not come with all the fancy features, separate remote controls or automatic flushing. However, the basic functions are all there - IF it is compatible with your setup. US toilets tend to be a bit more uniform than in other countries, and as long as you pick the right version (round or elongated) chances are decent it will fit. Some brands might use non-standard hole patterns, which might make this incompatible, so check before ordering.

Like all seats like these it needs hookups to both water and power - the power part tends to the the issue for most people since most US bathrooms lack power outlets near the toilet. The water hookup is pretty basic for a DIY:er, the set includes a tee that branches off a tiny plastic hose to the seat, the hose itself does not look super reliable and I might look at replacing both the hose and tee with something better, I fully expect to be on my own if this ever started leaking...

With those caveats, if you're looking for a bidet seat on a budget, this is a decent candidate."
"I was so nervous about getting this. I had always wanted a bidet but I was also a little worried about installing it and I didn't want to have any mishaps. I was also worried about how it would feel. As an American, no one really has these. No one I ever knew growing up had one of these.

There's no going back to toilet paper after using one of these! Toilet paper cannot get you as clean as a bidet can. Toilet paper will always leave some debris on you.

This bidet is the top of the line! You can control the amount of pressure being applied, the temperature of the water, the direction of the stream, and with this one you won't have to worry about being left wet because there's a blow dryer built in and you can control the temperature of the air coming out. The warmer you set it the faster you are going to dry.

Ladies, when it's that time of the month, this will keep your shower fresh every single time you use the restroom. No more feeling gross.

Then, for those of us with issues with constipation, there's a feature on here that will direct warm water in a specific area that will induce a bowel movement. You will want to work your way to this if you're new to using a bidet though. It can be a little scary at first but I can promise you, it's worth getting used to using. I can now go once a day if I choose to and before due to health problems and medications, I would only go #2 once every 10 days or so. I feel cleaner, healthier, and I am saving money and the environment at the same time. There's just no reason for us to continue using toilet paper.

The only thing I didn't like about this is that I feel the water attachment port is a bit of a liability. I am very worried that one of my kids, mainly the toddler, will pull this right out of the bidet. It doesn't screw in or clamp on. You simply just pop it right in and it doesn't leak or anything but I am worried that it's going to be accidentally pulled out and I will suddenly have a flood in my house. The other issue I have with this is that the electrical plug that is totally necessary is on the wrong side of the toilet seat for my apartment so I had to use an extension cord that goes behind the toilet to access electricity. If they could come up with a reversed set up so that you could order it on this side or that, that would be wonderful.

I really love the product all in all and I don't have a single complaint about it. I think it would be great for any household and I hope that in time, all Americans will find themselves saying good bye to TP!"
"This toilet seat installation is very easy with only 3 water host connections, and seat nuts to tie up. You might need to adjust the seat position like mine but that is pretty straight forward. The only one thing that took me a bit more time is the electrical wiring. I need to keep it away from the water line in case the water leaks. Other than that, it is a very user friendly installation process.

All the switches are easy to get used to and they works well for us. The weather here is getting warmer into summer season now. I think we will be more appreciate the warm water when the weather getting cooler into winter season. Overall, I think this is a good toilet seat. Only the price seems to be higher than ordinary budget range if you do not mind."
"I was so eager to get this smart toilet seat because I have always wanted one ever since I tried one out at a sushi restaurant on a trip long ago. This one caught my eye because it did not need to be tied into a warm water outlet and would heat the water itself. That was an absolute must have feature for me.

When it arrived I found myself delaying the install and realized I was intimidated. I am no novice to putting things together but somehow this seemed like it must be complicated. Then I looked in the instruction booklet that came with it and was pleasantly surprised to find that installation was very simple.

There is a base plate that you take off the seat and then using the provided parts you attach this to the toilet. Even though the instructions were good I still had a few questions. Here is what I figured out. There is an 'anchoring rubber' that you must push through the holes in the toilet rim to secure the base. You may have to press it hard and wiggle to get it into place.

It does not tell you exactly where to put the steel disc on the mounting base. You will have to estimate the distance of the new seat to your toilet tank and set it up with that in mind. It allows quite a bit of variation since toilets are different from one another. Once you decide the distance, keep screwing the screws in until the stop and the mounting base is firm.

Attaching the valve to the toilet tank was easy and so was connecting the PE pipe from the valve to the toilet seat. I turned on the water and there were no leaks at all, so I plugged it in.

There is a nice blue light in the toilet bowl that you can turn off if you want. When you sit on the seat it immediately starts to warm the seat for you. You can select the type of cleaning you want and also adjust the nozzle position as well as the water and air temperature. When you want, you can stop things with a button as well. You can also press the auto button and it will run through clean/dry/stop.

I am quite pleased with this and already feel like it is improving my life. There is definitely going to be a savings in toilet paper. I also will be going around with a smug 'fresh from my fancy toilet seat' feeling that is probably not going to wear off any time soon. Glad to have this in my life."
"This bidet electronic toilet seat is beyond amazing. If I could give it ten stars I would. Installation was a snap. I am not a plumber, but had absolutely no issues with installing this smart toilet seat. One thing to note - after you install the water lines you will probably notice that on the water inlet into the seat that a little plastic part of the connector may stick out a bit. This is completely normal. The curious in me pushed in on that little plastic piece and I quickly found out it is made like that for easy disconnect when you want to. Of course I had water flying around, but it was no real issue and I learned quickly. This seat has pretty much every feature you could dream up under the sun. From warming water where you adjust the temperature to air drying where you can also adjust the temperature to your preference. I must preface this review that I have never used a bidet before and the experience was amazing. You will be super clean beyond your wildest imagination. For the price of what you get here it is an amazing bargain. I actually prefer this smart bidet toilet seat to a more expensive toilet, such as a Toto toilet, because should anything ever go wrong then you’ll still have your regular toilet working just as it normally would so it makes it really easy should any maintenance or repairs ever be needed. I also love the blue night light that you can turn on/off as you wish or have automatically on. It makes my toilet look as though it’s a super high end model. I have it mounted on a pretty standard Kohler elongated seat toilet and it fits to a T. Be aware that you will need an electrical outlet (make sure it’s grounded GFI) near your unit, or you can do as I have and use a three prong extension cord to my existing GFI outlet. I very highly recommend this toilet to anyone wanting a bidet. Actually, after using it I think everyone actually needs a bidet. Amazing product for an amazing price with a ton of amazing features. Wonderful!"
"This smart bidet toilet seat is easily adjustable to anyone’s comfort level as it has adjustable water pressure, air pressure and heat functions. My favorite part is the heated seat as it still gets chilly at night here in the mid-west. Install took a little longer than expected. Some areas of the instructions are unclear, and for that reason, install took a couple hours. The seat fits perfectly with my elongated bowl on my Kohler toilet. I also like the heated water function as it makes it more comfortable to properly clean yourself. Overall, this is a great bidet toilet seat with many useful options."
This is the coolest thing ever. 5 stars for sure
"This is a well-built, all-in-one bidet. The seat, bidet, and lid are all included as one unit. The quality of the parts and fittings are excellent. You can tell quality was important in the manufacture.

The installation was straightforward. Just follow the instruction. What took time was replacing the rigid metal toilet hose in my home with 18"" flexible hose bought from Amazon and snaking the plug along the wall and inside the cabinet to the opposite side of the room to plug into the wall socket. I had to buy an extension wire and two-sided tape to complete the job. The bidet works like a dream with all of the bells and whistles. This is a high-end model at the fraction of the cost.

This bidet is reminiscent to the ones we used when visiting relatives in Korea including the seat warmer and drying function. I don't know why we don't have more bidets installed in the homes in USA. This is one of those products that once you get used to it, you can't go back."
"UPDATE:

9-months in and the Water and Seat stopped heating. Then 3 weeks later the heated seat started working again. Then, all of a sudden (10 months after install), the WATER STOPPED SPRAYING MIS-USE). This is a HUGE disappointment. This is a staple of our lives now. I can't imagine life without a bidet. The fact that we can no longer use this to clean ourselves and have to resort to primitive paper wiping is despicable. I thought this product was great...but if I can't even get a single year's use out of it, then this product is trash. We have done everything correctly according to the upkeep instructions. Perhaps a name brand is the way to go? Perhaps the manufacturer will see this comment and help us out...

This is amazing. I've always wanted a bidet--and a proper one. Not just a simple add-on attachment. This one has a heated seat, variable water pressure control, heated water, and even a blow drier! We save SO much money on toilet paper now it's not even funny. Our kids even love using it. Installation was pretty easy. There were a few issues when the plumbing and getting the fittings together without leaking. The Telflon tape included was not the best so I used some of my own. The ""O"" ring inside the main splitter was broken too...so I had to go to my hardware store to replace that. After that success, everything worked just fine. If you are not experienced with plumbing, have a professional do it for you. But you can do it yourself if you have some know-how.

Just a few negatives;
You lose about 4"" of toilet bowl length on the backside of the toilet opening. I imagine this is where all of the hardware and electronics are. It kinda sucks--but not a bad price to pay for a shiny bottom
The water will splash up on the backside of the toilet if you're not ""sealed"" onto the bowl. This mostly happens with little bottoms...i.e. kids. There IS a child function on the seat--but this mostly controls water pressure and temperature
There is a sensor on the seat that prevents anything from working if no one is sitting on it. This is good b/c then the bidet won't start squirting water all over your bathroom. However--it's right under one of your thighs. We use a squatty-potty to elevate our legs when sitting on the throne...doing this lifts our legs just a little off of the seat...so that they no longer register with the sensor. In order to then use the bidet, you have to take your legs off of the elevated squatty potty in order to regain pressure with the sensor. Also, my kids' little legs (8 and 10-year-olds) have a hard time activating the sensor as well)

It may be obvious, but you need access to a wall outlet to use this. When we remodeled our bathroom, we had an outlet installed by our toilet b/c we knew we wanted one of these. If you don't, be prepared to run an extension cord.

All in all, we absolutely LOVE this and can't think of life without one. This is now officially the ""Dump"" toilet and all other bathrooms in the house are for #1 only, lol"
Overall this product is amazing. It is such a treat every time you go to the bathroom sit down the seat warmer warms you up the water cleans you out everything's like a dream. A bit tricky with the setup because I'm in an older place I had to manipulate the wiring and whatnot but overall assembly is easy installation is not too bad and the overall effect when it's all said and done is fantastic. The quality and Innovation is justifiable to the price point.
"Unfortunately we weren't able to fully install this bidet as of yet. The reason is due to how our toilet is setup and of no fault of the bidet.

The installation instructions were easily laid out and simple to understand. Everything you need is included for the installation and most people could probably get this setup in about an hour or so. Where our issue is that our toilet is hard piped straight into the water inlet, and we don't have the ability to insert the attachment into the water line."
"It's great, works well, really well, recommend to everyone. Installation is simple, hook up cold water and plug it in. It'll heat the water and the seat, which is awesome when it's cold inside. LOVE IT."
"This is a wonderful bidet which improves the quality of human life, especially if you are disabled, have health conditions, are becoming ill or otherwise struggle to cleanse yourself during your business, and so on. Installation is quick and easy, the instructions were legible, and they included a hardware packet to help you with the installation. You'll need an extension cord to power the seat. It has a wonderful, light blue light which is pleasant at night to help you find your unit if you're feeling unwell, without the disruptive bright bathroom lights. The options on it are awesome, and I honestly wish this was a popular standard for USA bathrooms. It will literally make you feel better when you use it compared to the regular toilets we have. My bathroom is in a chronically cold, heatless location, so having the heated option is really, really helpful, especially when having a health episode which is temperature-sensitive (ie: if you're sick and cold makes it worse, you won't need to deal with cold toilet seats chilling you to the bone anymore).

This is a great product, it does exactly as it's supposed to, and cleanup/maintenance is super easy. The value is excellent, as well, for all the features you get. You need this!"
My Mom lives with us and she is getting old and this really helped her a lot. It does a great job and does everything it says it is going to do. Overall this is a Fantastic Bidet seat.
"The ZMJH A201 Elongated Smart Toilet Seat, Unlimited Warm Water, Vortex Wash, Electronic Heated Warm Air Dryer, Bidget Seat, Rear, and Front Wash, and LED Light were spectacular. Not to mention I love how easy it is to install it and it only takes mere 15 minutes tops if you really need to. It definitely is something that I've always dreamt about having up one day or something of this magnitude and I love the way the light glows so that you don't have any misconception of where you're sitting or what's inside the toilet. I know I've seen a lot of videos lately where people open up the toilet seat and have more than they bargained for. So this is absolutely great and well worth it!"
"This bidet is really easy to install. Simply mount the mounting plate on the toilet and slide the bidet into its slot until it locks into place. The connections are very simple.. one water inlet which hooks up to your existing toilet plumbing (everything is included to help you install the T connection) and one electric plug.
The functions are really simple to use and the control pad is very intuitive. All functions like washing - drying - light - deodorizing - massage etc, work flawlessly!
Overall I love this bidet and would definitely recommend it!"
" Seriously, all I can think of is why we didn't get this decades ago. Not only is this bidet seat helpful physically but it's so comfortable and I feel so clean. No more cold toilet seat. Warm adjustable water pressure, and various spray functions which you can set that work for you.
This great bidet is equipped with Water Heater (3 adjustable temperatures), Heated Seat (3 adjustable temperatures), Water pressure adjustment (3 adjustable levels), and Warm Air Dryer (3 different temperatures). The Stainless-steel nozzle will wash itself, wash you, rewash itself, and then tuck itself to the back. Hybrid heating technology offers continuous warm water during your entire experience. Also, the seat and lid have a slow self-closing function, so no slamming shut. Has illuminating LED nightlight: The cool blue LED nightlight is excellent for nighttime bathroom trips.
It came with all the hardware needed, including the water supply ""T"" fitting that fastened right to the toilet tank inlet, as well as the waterline from the ""T"" fitting to the bidet. No trips to the hardware store, no leaks.
Once you get used to this bidet seat, you will wonder why you didn't get a bidet before! I highly recommend this product."
"We got this for one of our bathrooms in our cottage.

We have used one before and enjoyed it so we wanted another one.
It arrives in a box, ready to install.
It took about 20 minutes to do the installation.
It seems to be made well.
The unit itself feels strong and durable.
It is easy to use.
It is comfortable to use.
It works very well.

We would buy this again."
"This smart bidet is AWESOME. Now this is a luxury experience whenever you use the bathroom!
The seat has a sensor built in and the warmer kicks on as soon as you sit down and stops as soon as you get up! The light is really bright and easy to see at night. The water jet leaves you feeling clean but could use a little more pressure to help you ""go"". And the best part is the deodorizer and the fans to dry you off! This virtually eliminates the need for tissue paper if you're thorough!"
"I loved this thing!

Installation was relatively simple. My only issue was not having quite the right size wrench and leverage to properly reattach the three-way valve to the shaft going into the toilet, so had to call the apartment maintenance guys. The adjustability of the seat forward and back while making installation flexible, I couldn't quite lock it down tightly enough to keep it from moving back and forth. This wasn't a big issue, but a small annoyance.

I will say that as a BIG guy... the much smaller hole for the seat was concerning, but ultimately not that much of an issue. Even with the adjustability of the nozzle while cleaning, you do need to wiggle or lean to each side a bit to get full coverage of the sprayer.

Ultimately, I returned mine. The only reason was because the heating element for the water went out after two-weeks. It wasn't so bad with just cold water... but man... having had that heavenly warmth... Mmmm... nothing else compares. Other than that, I would have kept the bidet. [FYI: Keep all of the original packaging just in case.]

I would say that the Child Setting was actually the nicest. Even though you can control pressure, temperature, and position of the spray, the Child Setting was the most comfortable ""One Button"" setting to use.

The only real concern I had was once everything was installed... I wasn't sure how, if I needed to move in the future, I could disconnect the water tubing from the bidet and three-way valve stem. Both ends appear to lock in place.

If you've got the right tools, and are handy enough to potentially have to change out that tower/post thing in the toilet tank if need be... get it. You will LOVE it!"
"As easy to install as a new toilet seat and supply hose. So if familiar with that, the job is simple. Only catch is you do have to run 120 VAC power to the bidet; which is not usually available in a toilet closet (but is in a general bathroom with sink). Worse case, use a 15A extension cord. Best case, have an electrician install a GFI outlet near the toilet.

Be prepared though. 95+% of the time, you will likely have to replace the supply line shut-off valve. The typical installed ones are very cheap and the rubber seal disintegrates quickly. Make sure to use a new all-metal quarter-turn ball valve.

It is easy to operate and setup. Note that instructions are not clear. Power Saver mode seems to use low settings until you sit on it. Then it works to get to the desired settings. So the unit is always drawing power if on. Helpful as the seat stays warm then.

The only one drawback / complaint is the seat itself. It is made of two molded plastic pieces snapped (or glued) together. That leaves a crease / crack around the whole inner bottom edge. This crease is extremely difficult to get clean when it gets dirty.

As I had been using a 4"" raised toilet seat before, I simply replaced that with a toilet riser so this new bidet seat could be directly on the toilet as intended."
It was a good bidet for the price when I bought in August 2023. After only 4 months the water heating element doesn’t heat the water anymore. That was one of the main reasons I bought this bidet. Now it is crippled in its use and I don’t think the company or amazon will do anything to fix this.
"I can't say enough good about these bidet seats. I purchased for my elderly parent, who has dementia. It has been a true lifesaver, in being able to provide safe, comfortable hygienic care. I liked the first one so much, I bought an elongated version. Then, I purchased one for my daughter for a gift.

Which is to say, these are fantastic! They have adjustable pressure and temperature, are self-cleaning and relatively easy to install. You need to have an electrical outlet near the commode, and you should be able to follow basic instructions. But the fittings make installation pretty easy.

I have only one complaint - my LED on the rounded bidet seat has burned out. You can see the difference in the two photos I attached here. I don't know why that happened. I unplugged and let the seat sit for about ten minutes, but it still has this reduced illumination. I purchased both in August 2023.

I have not been able to find any troubleshooting information on the website, for this problem.
Since it is not affecting the other functions (at present) I will continue to use it. I did like having the illumination for those inevitable middle-of-the-night calls of nature."
"Showed up on time .. easy installation .. all needed fittings and components were included .. 10 minute install .. wife loves the heated seat in the middle of the night .. plus the warm water bidet with blower to dry .. easy to use remote control !!
Very Satisfied !!!!!"
"I bought two of these, one round, and one elongated. On the plus side, they were very easy to install, the instructions are good. The water pressure is fairly good and can be adjusted, both pressure and temperature. On the down side, they're not very adjustable in terms of water direction. To get a good clean, I always have to sit as far back on the seat as I can, and then lean forward and squirm around to get good ""contact"". I've tried adjusting the position of the nozzle back and forth, tried both male and female sprayer options, and even tried unmounting the entire seat and adjusting forward and back, but nothing really helps. I always have to get into the ""scrunch back and lean forward"" position. Granted, if I can squirm into the right spot, it does a great job, but I've used these types of devices in Japan, and the point is that they're supposed to meet you where YOU are, not the other way around. There are also issues with the controls (sometimes a button moves the nozzle back and forth, sometimes the nozzle stays stationary), and the skin-sensor started to become erratic within a few days. Like it's supposed to detect if someone is sitting down on the seat or not before the nozzle would work, but on mine after a couple days it just stayed permanently on. Fortunately there's a related light so I could see that there was a problem. Turning the seat off and back on didn't help, but when I completely unplugged it to reset it, the sensor finally started working again.

In all, though there are definite advantages to this, there's enough that's not working that I'll be returning this and looking for another brand."
The water heating element stopped working on me in the middle of a clean. Don't buy this seat because it will not last.
"Had rotator cuff surgery, so I bought this to help with my personal business. The seat heats, there’s a nightlight, a remote control, warm water, and warm heat. I don’t know how I have lived without this my entire life. If this one breaks down the road I will replace it immediately. if you’re curious, don’t hesitate buy one now"
This was easier to install than one I had to return due to incorredt fittings for standard plumbing This one had the correct fitting to connect easily to existing pipes. The remote takes some getting used to.
"I bought this for my wife. She loves it. And so do I. I don't want to crap anywhere else. Great price. Heated seat, water and air. All with adjustable settings to fit your needs. It's great."
I would have given it 5 stars but the little plastic flap that opens when the air dryer turns on broke off the other day. That did not affect the way it works but affected the way it looks. Besides that it’s pretty awesome
I like this
My bottom side wonders how I ever lived without it
"The water heating light was blinking, so I took it off the mount and turned it on its side. It then worked fine. Just needed the water to get to some seal or something. Happy with the purchase."
"Love this bidet! It is a great product so great that we bought a second one!

However, our second one came and the remote wasn't working and needed to be paired to the bidet. I scoured the internet and saw additional reviews here on this page looking for pairing instructions. I found that the QR code on the back of the remote takes you to a Korean youtube like site if you scan it enough times. The instructions I found there worked and I will describe them below:

1. With the bidet power on, press and hold the female cleaning button on the side of the bidet until you hear it chime multiple times and the indicator lights come on. Release the button.
2. Press the stop button on the remote within 10 seconds to finish the pairing process.

That's it! It should be relinked! Worked on mine like a charm!"
Excellent product with programmable options!
"Everything worked as it should besides the ability to move the direction of the sprayer. Front and back wash and the ""deep clean"" are all basically the same. And for the money I don't feel as though I should have to move myself to meet it. Don't spend enough time on it to really take advantage of the heated seat or warm water. Wound up returning it for a basic non electric one."
So far my wife loves it
I’m older and have hemorrhoids making it difficult to easily clean with toilet paper. Now I’m so happy. Works great!
"The bidet works fine, however the remote broke after only 4 months. We now have to use side buttons which you can’t really see. Is there a way to get a new remote? It’s not the batteries. We are disappointed because the remote allows so many more options and we can see it."
"This isn't a bad bidet seat for the money. It works with a hard to fit toilet. I had doubts, but all I had to do is not tighten the screws all the way and it clicked into place tightly. The only issue I have is the seat gets a little hot when first sitting on it even when set on cooler temperature. Same for the water, but it cools down quickly. Not a deal breaker. The remote is great. This was installed on my 94 year old moms toilet and she has dementia. There is an auto setting on the remote to push one button and it will wash and dry. I would recommend this bidet seat."
"This bidet was easy to install and has great features including a heated seat, heated water, drying function. The remote control is easy to use. Recently I remodeled my bathroom and the contractor broke the holder for the remote control. The great folks at ZMJH sent me a new holder and remote. Really prompt service!!!!"
"Play Video
 Best money I had spent on my toilet lol, remote is great, feature is great, installing is easy, elevated the look of my toilet as well"
I have a few bidets now and this one is working very nicely. Super easy install (myself) and I really really love and suggest anyone get a bidet with the remote separate if they can. Makes it easier for bigger people who don’t need to take pictures of the remote attached that is now blocked by their big hips etc etc (i hear).
"I always wanted to get a heated Seat and Bidet and this Seat has delivered! Super easy install took me less than 30min. I am getting one more for my other bathroom, hopefully they last."
"I ordered a new product, not a refurbished, reconditioned or returned item. The listing should state clearly what is being sold and the price should reflect it as well."
"This is the second one I've purchased, they are super easy to install and I only needed 1 screwdriver. Installed it in 10 minutes and was ready to use in 5 minutes more. 😁. Definitely recommend one of these for everyone!"
"Im having both shoulders replaced, so…. This is great"
Loved it until the water heating element stopped working after two months.
This thing Rocks. At first the remote did not work. But with the help of the supplier. They helped me resync my remote control.
"I purchased two of these bidet’s and leaked. I really needed at least one with a remote control as my wife is having a shoulder replacement surgery.
Both bidet’s were faulty! Return was not an issue but that’s all that was positive about this purchase."
"I wish I could give an adequate review of this product. However, the unit arrived without the waterline necessary to install it, and after three tries at replacements we were still unable to use the unit and had to ship it back and purchase different unit due to this one’s unavailability, the new unit is arrived and installed, and I’m still awaiting my refund for the one I returned that arrive, missing his parts and pieces"
"I have had this for a couple months, it worked great up until now and it’s no longer warming up the water. It’s a great product when it’s not shooting cold water into your brown starfish. It’s also bulky and doesn’t fit all the way to the back of the toilet. Was easy to install. Wouldn’t say it’s worth the money seeing as it’s shooting ice into the forbidden hole."
"Looks great, easy to install, but unable to stop the leaky fitting provided."
"I have returned two because the hot water does not work after a few uses.
The third one I received did not work at all. Had to re-install the old one with hot water not working.

Go with another brand."
"purchased on September 21, today is October 22 and my heating element for my water has completely completely stopped working and now all the water is extremely cold. it lasted a little less than a month."
"Easy enough to install, but it doesn’t work. I’ve been through all of the troubleshooting suggested multiple times. I did manage to get it to spray a couple of times, but the electronics are junk and most of the time you push the buttons and nothing ever happens. Kind of inconvenient when you’re relying on it to do its job."
"This product looks like it was a return item, the seat has a flaw on it. The bag and seat was wet see pictures. This is for my elderly father to use"
Purchased this unit in Aug and now Sept is already stop working … just couple days ober the 30 days return policy
Semi easy to install but the seat is very flimsy. Would suggest another alternative before considering this model
"Everything else about this bidet is great. The pressure is pretty good. The heated seat is a godsend and my cats love to sit on the lid with the heated seat on underneath. The heated dry also still works, but trying to change the water temperature does nothing. We have only lived in our house for two years, so I know the heated water stopped working within the last 1.5 years. Which is really disappointing because it was one of the reasons why we bought it. We never got around to doing the warranty because it’s only one year and we just had a baby at the time."
"Although when you first use a bidet toilet seat, you are going to experience something different. However, once you get used to it, you will never want to use anything else! The ""clean"" just cannot be beat.

You just have to stay away from less expensive seats that do not have the option of warm water. That is a total turnoff and a waste of money.... you won't like the feeling and just will stop using it.

This seat has everything you need. First, the seat is HEATED....Try this in the morning and you will have a smile on your face instead of SHOCK! Next, you have several options of the power of the cleanse. Find what is right for you and know you will be cleaner than you have been since Mom stopped changing your diapers!

Try it.....You will like it! And if you make sure to try it within 30 days, and you don't like it, with Amazon, you are protected with their fantastic return policy....Just Gotta Love this!!!"
This bidet fit my elongated toilet perfectly. I had never used a bidet before and I can tell you that I feel so much cleaner with the bidet over using toilet paper. I like the heated seat and heated water as well as the dryer function. The nightlight is a plus when getting up to go to the toilet at night.
"ZMJH A201S Electronic Smart Bidet Toilet Seat,Self Cleaning Hydroflush,Hybrid Heating,Heated Dryer,Nightlight,Vortex Wash, remote control (Elongated)

Installation is pretty easy. The connection to the bottom of the tank is easy todo. I didn't need to use any tools. I did have to hook up new power supply as my bathroom did not come with one. I hooked it up to the light switch and I did notice the light flickers a little while the unit is in use. so maybe extend it from an existing plug instead.
I like that the supply line was just a plug in and work kind. I was skeptical at first but it worked pretty well.

I did notice this elongated version has a narrower opening. The unit takes some space toward the end of the seat. but it is also narrower than I expected. it works for me but I do feel it is a little tight.
There is a gap between the opening position to the back of the tank.

There are many operational options. auto, spa, feminine etc. with options for water/seat/air temp as well.
I did fine the water temperature to be inconsistence and the seat to be hotter than I like it. even at the low setting. but it works for me.

I did not like that the power indicator lights and others. seat, water, etc are on all the time. I actually didn't need the night light because of these indicator lights being on all the time.
Overall this is a decent bidet. it is a little on the medium cost range."
"Wow, my whole family and I never used a bidet until we got this one. There is so many cool features, and the heating for the air, seat, and water work so quick. Only thing is it was kind of hard to install, but after done you wont want to go without it!"
"This is my second bidet, the first one I have no issues with, but decided to try a different brand for my bedroom. As you can see in my pictures, this thing begins to crack and then pieces starts to fall off the worst it gets. These pictures are after using it for only 7 months and I only weight 210lbs at 6' 1"". The material they use to create these are obviously very cheap."
"I love having a warm toilet seat every time i sit down! the bidet is also nice to have as i always feel fresh and clean after using the toilet.

i have not been able to get the remote to work but the buttons on the side of the seat are working fine for me.

the light inside the bowl is nice but a bit bright at night when i am sleepy. lol"
"Easy to install, my husband had already prepped for an outlet near the toilet during a recent remodel. The bidet has lots of features and is easy to use and navigate. Not having used a bidet before it takes a little getting used to. My adult children rave about them so we really did this for them when they come to visit. The seat heats up (a little too much if you are not paying attention, we leave it on the lowest setting), the water heats up, the dryer works fine but you just have to make sure you are seated correctly. The back part of the seat does appear a little bulky on the toilet itself but I understand you need this for the water feature etc... The opening of the seat does seam a little smaller than a standard toilet but I'm not sure if this is a feature of all bidets?
I really love, love, love the the fact that I am no longer cleaning around the bolts of the standard toilet seat after the men in my life use the toilet. It is very easy to clean this seat. You can also slide the seat off and on very easy. You just install a base directly to the toilet and then clip the rest of the unit onto the base. My kids came to visit last weekend and gave it the thumbs up."
"After the mass toilet paper extinction of 2020, we got several bidets for our house. We will never go back to sandpaper on Uranus.
This is not one of the ""big name"" brands of bidets, so we were concerned about it's performance. It has the typical features like heated seat, heated blower and heated water. They are all too hot to me at the high setting, but ok at the lowest.
The water jet is strong enough to clean without being uncomfortable. My problem with all bidets that I have tried is the dryer is just sooo low pressure that I usually have to run it twice.
This bidet keeps up with or exceeds the name brands. It's easy to install and use."
"Setup was simple and went off without a hitch. The water intake hose is about 2x as long as it needed to be, so I'll probably go back and trim that at some point. Can someone please explain to me why the water line is placed on the opposite side from where it needs to go? I mean, your power could be on either side, but you know the water will almost always need to be on the left side when facing the toilet - so why is the intake on the right side so you have to cross behind? It doesn't affect the function of the seat, but it does impact the look.

I was initially a bit concerned about the significantly raised back of this seat but, after using it for nearly a week, I'm finding it more comfortable than a traditionally flat one. There are three options for water pressure, water temperature, seat temperature, and air temperature. Despite that, I found very little variation between the options. For example, for water temperature I would expect something like ""no longer freezing,"" ""pleasantly warm,"" and ""almost hot"" as the three options. Instead it's all variations of warm with a couple degrees of difference. Same goes with the air dry and seat warmer. Water pressure is a bit more noticeable but again, I would have appreciated a wider range.

Without going into gratuitous detail, it does its job of cleaning well. Toilet paper is no longer required in one of our bathrooms as long as the air dry is used."
"I like just about everything about this bidet seat. The remote is good. There is a myriad of options that are all customizable from water placement and temperature to water pressure.

The power cord seems a bit too short for the US market where our bathroom power outlets are mandated by code to be a minimum distance from bathtubs (toilets are usually right next to the tub).

My main concern is the mounting bracket. It seems a bit to thin to stand up to repeated usage throughout the day. We'll see. If it breaks, I might need to engineer one on my 3D printer out of nylon as a replacement.

The installation instructions could also be a bit more complete. I was able to figure it all out, but I have quite a bit of plumbing experience."
"Easy to set up. Remote is easy to use. Different temperature for seat warmer. All of the functions work great!
It does beep every time you seat and stand, I haven’t figured out yet if I can turn that function off. Other than that, it’s great. Definitely recommend!"
"I am super excited about this Smart Bidet toilet seat at a great price. Our electrician will install this on a Swiss Madison St Tropez One-Piece Dual Flush toilet which I think will be a good match. It will be our 3rd smart toilet for our home and the cheapest solution. Our realtor wants us to install a bathroom in our poolhouse meant to awe. With 2 other smarties, I wasn't keen on spending the money. This is a great solution for us, meant to impress the realtor.

In the box, the seat looks like the others. I like that it has many of the same higher end features like the heated seat, hydro flush, night light and remote. This is a nice solution who want to have the technology without breaking the bank!"
"This is indeed a very smart electronic bidet toilet seat. It does the expected cleaning and then some. Heated--yes, your choice of three temps. for three functions: water, seat and air dryer! Nightlight--yes (but not overly bright). Variable Water Pressure--got that too, setting for kids and adults. Energy Conscious--yes, use energy save mode. Warranty--yep, 1-year warranty included. Oh, it also has a remote control should the buttons on the side of the seat not be convenient.

Having never installed even a traditional toilet seat, this one worried me. I shouldn't have been concerned. The instructions are very clear and the installation video was so helpful. This model requires that the electrical cord be able to plug into traditional a wall outlet. It's a great seat, buy it."
"We have the manual bidet for many years and we love it.

But let me tell you this: wow

This is definitely a game changer. Basically you are getting the job done from A to Z lol

It was super easy to install and take some time to figure the settings that you like.

For example, the seat can get little too warm for me so I’m using the lowest heat. Other than that it was perfect and very convenient.

Another good point is that it’s really easy to clean the seat since the plastic is one flat piece.

Really incredible product and we love it. I’ll save the pictures and video for other people to post hihihi"
"This bidet was very easy to install. I had the old toilet seat off and this one installed in less than half an hour. It looks great and functions wonderfully.

I really appreciate the remote control. It is nice not having to reach for the controls and I can bring them where I can see them. What I like the most is the ability to control the water pressure to make things just right. In addition to water pressure this also allows you control of seat temperature, water temperature and air temp as well.

A really great addition to my bathroom."
" This is a wonderful bidet with many features and benefits. This might go without saying, but this unit requires an electrical outlet very close to the toilet. I feel silly for not thinking of this before I ordered but I didn't. So My install is on hold until I can get an GFI outlet installed in the corner next to my toilet. This might slow things down a little for me.

Features include three adjustable water temperatures, three adjustable seat temperatures, three adjustable water pressure, warm air dryer with three different levels. A stainless steel nozzle that washes itself after each use. It. Use a hybrid heating technology that offers continuous warm water during use. It has an illuminating LED night light."
This has so many features- I cannot wait to attach this. We need to get someone to help hook it up because of the hoses- but it’s got awesome features we cannot wait to use
"The install takes about 10 minutes if you know what you're doing and don't need to change your plumbing set up. It isn't hard. The instructions were pretty good. Overall, the bidet works great. Good water pressure and design. I really like it."
"This durable, it's hygienic, it just makes sense. Our stainless steel nozzle will wash itself, wash you, wash itself again, and then tuck itself to back."

"Approximately 10 years ago, I stayed at a luxury resort. My favorite thing about that trip was the bidet in the bathroom. This is exactly like the experience I had at that luxury resort. The bidet is easy to install. I don’t say that lightly, being a single, female, senior citizen. If I can do it, anybody can. It took less than 20 minutes. The seat is heated. You can even control the temperature. You can also control the temperature of the water. It has a light to illuminate the bowl. It also has a dryer. The spray is adjustable too! There are so many options! There’s additionally a remote control. I can go on and on and tell you how wonderful it is, but truly try it for yourself and I am sure you won’t regret it."
"Play Video
 Installs in just a few steps and works great."
"It installed quick and easily. It's the first bidet we've had, but it's nice. You can change the temp of the water, seat warmer and the air. You can change the pressure of the water, and it has a child lock. It has a skin sensor in the seat, which is great so the kids don't use it as a water fountain. It has a light which helps with the kids at night. Overall I think it is a great buy."
"This thing is super nice! We had a general, run of the mill, very basic, bidet before this one. It is super luxurious! It has all the bells and whistles and hits all the right spots. Takes care of all the dirty bits and you will use way less toilet paper!"
Please don’t buy this product. The heating of the seat and stopped working after 4 months. Wasted my money. I called for support and hold for more than 1 hours and no response from the manufacturer. It seems this product Chinese made and getting support very hard. I am so upset the fact that people sell this product and not keeping the manufacturers warranty promise to fix or replace the product.

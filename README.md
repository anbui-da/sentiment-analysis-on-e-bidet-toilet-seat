Electric bidet toilet seat not only keeps hygiene but also help reducing the usage of toilet paper in US. According to Kluger (2023), it is said that "the average American will go through 26 kg (57 lbs) of toilet paper in a single year. Multiply that by the 332 million people in the U.S. and you get more than 19 billion pounds of waste paper being flushed away annually. All by itself that represents a massive disposal and sanitation challenge." Based on that, the market for this product line still has a lot of room to grow. Therefore, in this project, it attempts to understand customer behavior by conducting sentiment analysis on electric bidets.

### Business context
ABC Company, a leader in sanitary ware, aims to enhance bathroom experiences with its new electric bidet toilet seat, particularly for the North American market. Understanding customer preferences, pain points, and expectations is key to the new product development.
